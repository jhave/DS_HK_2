 little black girl in a red dress 
on a hothight with a broken shoe 
little black girl you shoulde never left home 
theres probly someone thats still waitin' up for you 
its cold back in chicago 
but in los angles its worse 
when all you got is $29.00 and an alligator purse 
 
i see already that vulture in the fleetwood 
with the startruse hood 
can see you're trying to get you bearrings 
and you say hey which ways the main stem 
and where ever you say you're from 
he'll say he grew up there himself 
 
and he'll comeon and make you feel 
like you grew up right next door to him 
and you say take a left on a central 
and he trows it in reverse 
cause you only got $29.00 and an alligator purse 
 
and he'll come on like a gentleman 
and you'll be a little shy 
you say you ex old man was a sax player 
he'll say baby i used to play bass for sly 
and you say you like his cadillac, say honey, i got 2 or 3 
he'll say sweetheart you're sure fortunate 
that you ran into me 
when you've done a dime in the joint 
you figure nothin' could be worse 
and you got $29.00 and an alligator purse 
 
well he got pharoh on the 8 track 
you start smokin' a little boo 
you thinkin' gettin' outofchicago was the 
best thing that ever happend to you 
startin' to like it already 
this cat seems to be cool 
and he says honey i know a good hotel out in west hollywood 
that'd be just right for you 
but he ain't know good samaritan 
he'll make sure he's reimursed 
lot more than $29.00 and a alligator purse 
 
now the sirens just an epilog 
the cops here always get there too late 
they always stop for coffee on the way to the scene of the crime 
then they always try so hard to look just like movie stars 
they couldnt catch a cold 
you ony wasting you dime 
and she's lucky to be alive 
the doctor whispered to the nurse 
she only lost a 1/2 pint of blood 
$29.00 and an alligator purse

'T'AIN'T NO SIN

 (Walter Donaldson/Edgar Leslie) 
 
When you hear sweet syncopation 
And the music softly moans 
T'ain't no sin to take off your skin 
And dance around in your bones 
 
When it gets too hot for comfot 
And you can't get an ice cream cone 
T'ain't no sin to take off your skin 
And dance around your bones 
 
Just like those bamboo babies 
Down in the South Sea tropic zone 
T'ain't no sin to take off your skin 
And dance around your bones

 

TOM WAITS
'TIL THE MONEY RUNS OUT

 check this strange beverage that falls out from the sky, splashin' bagdad on 
the hudson in panther martin's eyes, he's high and outside wearin' candy apple 
red, scarlet gave him twenty seven stitches in his head, with a pint of green 
chartruse ain't nothin' seems right, you buy the sunday paper on a saturday 
night. 
 
can't you hear the thunder someone stole my watch, i sold a quart of blood 
and bought a half a pint of scotch, some one tell those chinamen on telegraph 
canyon road, when there ain't no time to 
unload, so bye bye baby baby bye bye. 
 
droopy stranger lonely dreamer toy puppy and the prado, we're laughin' as 
they piled into olmos' el dorado, jesus whispered eni meany miney moe, they're 
too proud to duck their heads that's why they bring it down so low, so bye 
bye baby baby bye bye. 
 
the pointed man is smack dab in the middle of july, swingin' from the 
rafters in his brand new tie, he said i can't go back to that hotel room all 
they do is shout, but i'll stay wichew baby till the money runs out, so bye 
bye baby baby bye bye.

16 SHELLS FROM A THIRTY OUGHT SIX

 I plugged 16 shells from a thirty ought six 
and a Black Crow snuck through 
a hole in the sky 
so I spent all my buttons on an 
old pack mule 
and I made me a ladder from 
a pawn shop marimba 
and I leaned it up against 
a dandelion tree 
 
And I filled me a sachel 
full of old pig corn 
and I beat me a billy 
from an old French horn 
and I kicked that mule 
to the top of the tree 
and I blew me a hole 
'bout the size of a kickdrum 
and I cut me a switch 
from a long branch elbow 
 
Chorus 
I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin' 
Black Crow 16 shells from a thirty ought six 
whittle you into kindlin' 
Black Crow 16 shells from a thirty ought six 
 
Well I slept in the holler 
of a dry creek bed 
and I tore out the buckets 
from a red Corvette, tore out the buckets from a red Corvette 
Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three 
you got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree 
with the strings of a Washburn 
stretched like a clothes line 
you know me and that mule scrambled right through the hole 
 
Repeat Chorus 
 
Now I hold him prisoner 
in a Washburn jail 
that stapped on the back 
of my old kick mule 
strapped it on the back of my old kick mule 
I bang on the strings just 
to drive him crazy 
I strum it loud just to rattle his cage 
strum it loud just to rattle his cage 
 
Repeat Chorus

9TH & HENNEPIN

 Well it's 9th and Hennepin 
And all the donuts have 
Names that sound like prostitutes 
And the moon's teeth marks are 
On the sky like a tarp thrown over all this 
And the broken umbrellas like 
Dead birds and the steam 
Comes out of the grill like 
The whole goddamned town is ready to blow. 
And the bricks are all scarred with jailhouse tattoos 
And everyone is behaving like dogs. 
And the horses are coming down Violin Road 
And Dutch is dead on his feet 
And the rooms all smell like diesel 
And you take on the 
Dreams of the ones who have slept here. 
And I'm lost in the window 
I hide on the stairway 
I hang in the curtain 
I sleep in your hat 
And no one brings anything 
Small into a bar around here. 
They all started out with bad directions 
And the girl behind the counter has a tattooed tear, 
One for every year he's away she said, such 
A crumbling beauty, but there's 
Nothing wrong with her that 
$100 won't fix, she has that razor sadness 
That only gets worse 
With the clang and thunder of the 
Southern Pacific going by 
As the clock ticks out like a dripping faucet 
Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin 
And you spill out 
Over the side to anyone who'll listen 
And I've seen it 
All through the yellow windows 
Of the evening train.

A LITTLE RAIN

 (Tom Waits/K. Brennan) 
 
The Ice Man's mule is parked 
Outside the bar 
Where a man with missing fingers 
Plays a strange guitar 
And the German dwarf 
Dances with the buthcer's son 
And a little rain never hurt no one 
And a little rain never hurt no one 
 
They're dancing on the roof 
ANd the ceiling's coming down 
I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves 
A little trouble makes it wurth the going 
And a little rain never hurt no one 
 
The world is round 
And so I'll go around 
You must risk something that matters 
My hands are strong 
I'll take any man here 
If it's worth the going 
It's worth the ride 
 
She was 15 years old 
And never seen the ocean 
She climbed into a van 
With a vagabond 
And the last theing she said 
Was, I love you mom. 
 
And a little rain 
Never hurt no one 
And a little rain 
Never hurt no one

A SWEET LITTLE BULLET FROM A PRETTY BLUE GUN

 it's raining it's pouring 
and you didn't bring a sweater 
nebraska'll never let you come back home 
and on hollywood and vine 
by the trifty mart sign 
and night i'll be willin' to bet 
there's a young girl 
with sweet little wishes 
and pretty blue dreams 
standin' there and gettin' all wet 
 
now there's a place off the drag 
called the gilbert hotel 
there's a couple letters burned out the sign 
and it's better then a bus stop 
and they do good business 
every time it rains 
for sweet little girls 
with nothing in their jeans 
but sweet little wishes 
and pretty blue dreams 
now it's raining it's pouring 
the old man is snoring 
now i lay me down to sleep 
i hear the sirens in the street 
all the dreams are made of chrome 
i have no way to get back home 
i'd rather die before i wake 
like marilyn monroe 
and throw my dreams out in 
the street and the 
rain will make em grow 
 
now the night clerk he got a club foot 
and he's heard times or more 
he says check out time is 10 am 
 
and that's just what he means 
and you go up the stairs 
with sweet little wishes 
and pretty blue dreams 
 
now it's raining it's pouring 
and hollywoods just fine 
swindle a little out of her dreams 
put a letter in the sign 
never trust a scarecrow 
wearin' shades after dark 
be areful of that old bow tie he wears 
it takes asweet little bullet 
from a pretty blue gun 
to put those scarlet ribbons in your hair 
no that ain't no cherry bomb 
4th of july's all done 
just some fool playin' that a second line 
from the barrel of a pretty blue gun 
 
no that ain't no cherry bomb 
4th of july's all done

from the barrel of a pretty blue gun.

ALL STRIPPED DOWN

 Well the time will come 
When the wind will shout 
All stripped down 
All stripped down 
And all the sinners know 
What I'm talking about 
All stripped down 
All stripped down 
When all the creatures of the world 
Are gonna line up at the gate 
 
And you better be on time 
And you better not be late 
All stripped 
All stripped down 
 
Well you know in your heart 
What you gotta bring 
All stripped down 
All stripped down 
No big mink coat 
No diamond ring 
All stripped down 
All stripped down 
 
Well take off your paint 
Take off your rouge 
All stripped down 
All stripped down 
Let your backbone flip 
And let your spirit shine through 
I want you all stripped 
All stripped 
All stripped down 
 
All the men we got 
Well they're goin' down the drain 
All stripped down 
All stripped down 
And when I see your sadness 
On a river of shame 
All stripped down 
All stripped down 
 
You got to raise up 
Bot the quick and the dead 
All stripped down 
All stripped down 
With no shoes on your feet 
No hat on your head 
I want you all stripped down 
All stripped 
All stripped down 
 
Ain't nothin' in my heart 
But fire for you 
All stripped down 
All stripped down 
With my rainy hammer 
And a heart that's true 
I want you all stripped 
All stripped 
All stripped down

ANYWHERE I LAY MY HEAD

 My head is spinning round 
My heart is in my shoes 
I went and set the Thames on fire 
Now I must come back down 
She's laughing in her sleeve at me 
I can feel it in my bones 
But anywhere, I'm gonna 
Lay my head, boys 
I will call my home. 
Well I see that 
The world is upside down 
My pockets were filled up with gold. 
Now the clouds have covered o'er 
And the wind is blowing cold 
I don't need anybody 
Because I learned to be alone 
And anywhere 
I lay my head, boys 
I will call my home.

BACK IN THE GOOD OLD WORLD (GYPSY)

 When I was a boy, the moon was a pearl the sun a yellow gold. 
But when I was a man, the wind blew cold the hills were upside down. 
But now that I have gone from here there's no place I'd rather be 
than to float my chances on the tide Back in the good old world. 
On October's last I'll fly back home rolling down winding way. 
Scare crows are all dressed in rags out at the edge of the field I lay 
and all I've got's a pocket full of flowers on my grave. 
Oh but summer is gone I remember it best 
Back in the good old world.

BAD LIVER AND A BROKEN HEART (IN LOWELL)

 Well I got a bad liver and broken heart, yeah, 
I drunk me a river since you tore me apart 
And I don't have a drinking problem, 'cept when I can't get a drink 
And I wish you'd a known her, we were quite a pair, 
She was sharp as a razor and soft as a prayer 
So welcome to the continuing saga, she was my better half, and I was just a dog 
And so here am I slumped, I've been chipped and I've been chumped on my stool 
So buy this fool some spirits and libations, it's these railroad station bars 
And all these conductors and porters, and I'm all out of quarters 
And this epitaph is the aftermath, yeah I choose my path, hey, come on, Kath, 
He's a lawyer, he ain't the one for ya 
No, the moon ain't romantic, it's intimidating as hell, 
And some guy's trying to sell me a watch 
And so I'll meet you at the bottom of a bottle of bargain Scotch 
I got me a bottle and a dream, it's so maudlin it seems, 
You can name your poison, go on ahead and make some noise 
I ain't sentimental, this ain't a purchase, it's a rental, and it's purgatory, 
And hey, what's your story, well I don't even care 
'Cause I got my own double cross to bear 
 
And I'll see your Red Label, and I'll raise you one more, 
And you can pour me a cab, I just can't drink no more, 
'Cause it don't douse the flames that are started by dames, 
It ain't like asbestos 
It don't do nothing but rest us assured, 
And substantiate the rumors that you've heard

An old blind tiger 
Get an old bell Jim

BIG JOE AND PHANTOM 309

 (Tommy Faile) 
 
well you see I happened to be back on the east coast 
a few years back tryin' to make me a buck 
like everybody else, well you know 
times get hard and well I got down on my luck 
and I got tired of just roamin' and bummin' 
around, so I started thumbin' my way 
back to my old hometown 
you know I made quite a few miles 
in the first couple of days, and I 
figured I'd be home in a week if my 
luck held out this way 
but you know it was the third night 
I got stranded, it was out at a cold lonely 
crossroads, and as the rain came 
pouring down, I was hungry, tired 
freezin', caught myself a chill, but 
it was just about that time that 
the lights of an old semi topped the hill 
you should of seen me smile when I 
heard them air brakes come on, and 
I climbed up in that cab where I 
knew it'd be warm at the wheel 
well at the wheel sat a big man 
I'd have to say he must of weighed 210 
the way he stuck out a big hand and 
said with a grin Big Joe's the name 
and this here rig's called Phantom 309 
well I asked him why he called his 
rig such a name, but he just turned to me 
and said Why son don't you know this here 
rig'll be puttin' 'em all to shame, why 
there ain't a driver on this 
or any other line for that matter 
that's seen nothin' but the taillights of Big Joe 
and Phantom 309 
So we rode and talked the better part of the night 
and I told my stories and Joe told his and 
I smoked up all his Viceroys as we rolled along 
he pushed her ahead with 10 forward gears 
man that dashboard was lit like the old 
Madam La Rue pinball, a serious semi truck 
until almost mysteriously, well it was the 
lights of a truck stop that rolled into sight 
Joe turned to me and said I'm sorry son 
but I'm afraid this is just as far as you go 
You see I kinda gotta be makin' a turn 
just up the road a piece, but I'll be 
damned if he didn't throw me a dime as he 
threw her in low and said Go on in there 
son, and get yourself a hot cup of coffee 
on Big Joe 
and when Joe and his rig pulled off into 
the night, man in nothing flat they was 
clean outa sight 
so I walked into the old stop and 
ordered me up a cup of mud sayin' 
 Big Joe's settin' this dude up but 
it got so deathly quiet in that 
place, you could of heard a pin drop 
as the waiter's face turned kinda 
pale, I said What's the matter did 
I say somethin' wrong? I kinda 
said with 8a half way grin. He said 
 No son, you see It'll happen every 
now and then. You see every driver in 
here knows Big Joe, but let me 
tell you what happened just 10 years 
ago, yea it was 10 years ago 
out there at that cold lonely crossroads 
where you flagged Joe down, and 
there was a whole bus load of kids 
and they were just comin' from school 
and they were right in the middle when 
Joe topped the hill, and could 
have been slaughtered except 
Joe turned his wheels, and 
he jacknifed, and went 
into a skid, and folks around here 
say he gave his life to save that bunch 
of kids, and out there at that cold 
lonely crossroads, well they say it 
was the end of the line for 
Big Joe and Phantom 309, but it's 
funny you know, cause every now and then 
yea every now and then, when the 
moon's holdin' water, they say old Joe 
will stop and give you a ride, and 
just like you, some hitchhiker will be 
comin' by 
 So here son, he said to me, get 
yourself another cup of coffee, it's on the 
house, you see I want you to hang on 
to that dime, yea you hang on to that 
dime as a kind of souvenir, a 
souvenir of Big Joe and Phantom 309

BLACK MARKET BABY

 She lives in a house 
That's way back off the road 
There's a man with a lantern 
And he carries her soul 
A coal stove and a bed 
A skillet and a hound 
She drove a camel through 
A needle 
In this sinking board walk town 
 
She's my Black Market Baby 
She's my Black Market Baby 
She's a diamond that 
Wants to stay coal 
Wants to stay coal 
 
I swang out wide with her 
On hells iron gate 
Anything that you wanted 
You could have 
My eyes say their prayers to her 
Sailors ring her bell 
Like a moth mistakes a light bulb 
For the moon and goes to hell 
 
She's my Black Market Baby 
She's my Black Market Baby 
She's a diamond that 
Wants to stay coal 
Wants to stay coal 
 
There's no prayer like desire 
There's amnesia in her kiss 
She's a swan and a pistol 
And she will follow you like this 
In Moverly, Missouri at the 
Iroquois Hotel 
She checked in with the President 
And she ran up quite a Bill 
(Chorus) 
She's whiskey in a teacup 
She gives blondes a lousy name 
She's a Bonzai Aphrodite 
And a ticket back to Spain 
She's a hard way to go 
And there ain't no way 
To stop 
Every time you play the red 
The black is coming up 
 
She's my Black Market baby 
She's my Black Market baby 
She's a diamond that 
Wants to stay coal 
Wants to stay coal

BLACK WINGS

 (Tom Waits/K. Brennan) 
 
Take an eye for an eye 
Take a tooth for a tooth 
Just like they say in the Bible 
Never leave a trace or forget a face 
Of any man at the table 
When the moon is a cold chiseled dagger 
Sharp enough to draw blood from a stone 
He rides through your dreams on a coach 
And horses and the fence posts 
In the midnight look like bones 
 
Well they've stopped trying to hold him 
With mortar, stone and chain 
He broke out of every prison 
Boots mount the staircase 
The door is flung back open 
He's not there for he has risen 
He's not there for he has risen 
 
Well he once killed a man with a guitar string 
He's been seen at the table with kings 
Well he once saved a baby from drowning 
There are those who say beneath his coat there are wings 
Some say they fear him 
Others admire him 
Because he steals his promise 
One look in his eye 
Everyone denies 
Ever having met him 
Ever having met him 
 
He can turn himself into a stranger 
Wel lthey broke a lot of canes on his hide 
he was born away in a cornfield 
A fever beats in his head like a drum inside 
Some say they fear him 
Others admire him 
Because he steals his promise 
One look in his eye 
Everyone denies 
Ever having met him 
Ever having met him

BLOW WIND BLOW

 Mary's on the black top 
There's a husband in 
the dog house 
In the middle of a shakedown 
She got 
quiet as a church mouose 
She found Raleigh's on 
the dashboard 
Sugar daddy caught a polocar 
Ain't no solitary 
tap dance way down here 
I swear I's riding 
on a field mouse 
we were dancin' in the slaughterhouse 
If you swing along the beltway 
then you skid along the all day 
cause I went a little crazy 
and I sat upon a high chair 
And I'm smokin like a diesel 
way out here 
Blow wind blow blow me away here 
blow wind blow (repeat)

BLUE SKIES

 Blue skies over my head 
Give me another reason to get out of bed 
And blue skies shine on my face 
Give me another woman to take her place 
Ain't got no money, cubards are bare 
No cigarettes and the kids got nothing to wear 
She walked out without a word 
Now the only sound left is the morning bird singing 
Blue skies over my head 
Give me another reason to get out of bed 
And blue skies shine on my face 
Give me another woman to take her place 
Blue skies over my head 
Give me another reason to get out of bed 
And blue skies shine on my face 
Give me another woman to take her place 
Give me another woman to take her place

BLUE VALENTINES

 She sends me blue valentines 
all the way from philadelphia 
to mark the anniversary 
of someone that I used to be 
and it feels just like there's 
a warrant out for my arrest 
got me checkin' in my rearview mirrror 
and I'm always on the run 
thats why I change my name 
and I didn't think you'd ever find me here 
 
to send me blue valentines 
like half forgotten dreams 
like a pebble in my shoe 
as I walk these streets 
and the ghost of your memory 
is the thistle in the kiss 
and the burgler that that can break a roses neck 
it's the tattooed broken promise 
that I hide beneath my sleeve 
and I see you every time I turn my back 
 
she sends me blue valentines 
though I try to remain at large 
they're insisting that our love 
must have a culogy 
why do I save all of this madness 
in the nightstand drawer 
there to haunt upon my shoulders 
baby I know 
I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go 
with a blind and broken heart 
that sleeps beneath my lapel 
 
she sends me blue valentines 
to remind me of my cardinal sin 
I can never wash the guilt 
or get these bloodstains off my hands 
and it takes a lot of whiskey 
to make these nightmares go away 
and I cut my bleedin' heart out every nite 
and I die a little more on each st. valentine day 
remember that I promised I would 
write you... 
these blue valentines 
blue valentines 
blue valentines

BURMA SHAVE

 licorice tattoo turned a gun metal blue scrawled across the shoulders 
of a dying town the one eyed jacks across the railroad tracks 
and the scar on its belly pulled a stranger passing through 
he was a juvenile delinquent never learned how to behave 
but the cops would never think to look in 
burma shave 
 
and the road was like a ribbon and the moon was like a bone 
he didn't seem to be like any guy she'd ever known 
he kinda looked like farley granger with his hair slicked back 
she says i'm a sucker for a fella in a cowboy hat 
how far are you going he said depends on what you mean 
he says i'm going thataway just as long as it's paved 
i guess you'd say i'm on my way to 
burma shave 
 
and her knees up on the glove compartment 
took out her barrettes and her hair spilled out like rootbeer 
and she popped her gum and arched her back 
hell marysville ain't nothing but a wide spot in the road 
some night my heart pounds just like thunder 
i don't know why it don't explode 
cause everyone in this stinking town has got one foot in the grave 
and i'd rather take my chances out in 
burma shave 
 
presley's what i go by why don't you change the station 
count the grain elevators in the rearview mirror 
mister anywhere you point this thing 
has got to beat the hell out of the sting 
of going to bed with every dream that dies here every mornin 
and so drill me a hole with a barber pole 
i'm jumping my parole just like a fugitive tonight 
why don't you have another swig 
and pass that car if you're so brave 
i wanna get there before the sun comes up in 
burma shave 
 
and the spider web crack and the mustang screamed 
smoke from the tires and the twisted machine 
just a nickel's worth of dreams and every wishbone that they saved 
lie swindled from them on the way to 
burma shave 
 
and the sun hit the derrick and cast a bat wing shadow 
up against the car door on the shot gun side 
and when they pulled her from the wreck you know she 
still had on her shades 
they say that dreams are growing wild just this side of 
burma shave

CHOCOLATE JESUS

 Don't go to church on Sunday 
Don't get on my knees to pray 
Don't memorize the books of the Bible 
I got my own special way 
Bit I know Jesus loves me 
Maybe just a little bit more 
 
I fall on my knees every Sunday 
At Zerelda Lee's candy store 
 
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus 
Make me feel good inside 
Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
Keep me satisfied 
 
Well I don't want no Anna Zabba 
Don't want no Almond Joy 
There ain't nothing better 
Suitable for this boy 
Well it's the only thing 
That can pick me up 
Better than a cup of gold 
See only a chocolate Jesus 
Can satisfy my soul 
 
(Solo) 
When the weather gets rough 
And it's whiskey in the shade 
It's best to wrap your savior 
Up in cellophane 
He flows like the big muddy 
But that's ok 
Pour him over ice cream 
For a nice parfait 
 
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus 
Good enough for me 
Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
Good enough for me 
 
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus 
Make me feel good inside 
Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
Keep me satisfied

CHRISTMAS CARD FROM A HOOKER IN MINNEAPOLIS

 hey Charley I'm pregnant 
and living on 9 th street 
right above a dirty bookstore 
off cuclid avenue 
and I stopped taking dope 
and I quit drinking whiskey 
and my old man plays the trombone 
and works out at the track. 
 
and he says that he loves me 
even though its not his baby 
and he says that he'll raise him up 
like he would his own son 
and he gave me a ring 
that was worn by his mother 
and he takes me out dancin 
every saturday nite. 
 
and hey Charley I think about you 
everytime I pass a fillin' station 
on account of all the grease 
you used to wear in your hair 
and I still have that record 
of little anthony & the imperials 
but someone stole my record player 
how do you like that? 
 
hey Charley I almost went crazy 
after mario got busted 
so I went back to omaha to 
live with my folks 
but everyone I used to know 
was either dead or in prison 
so I came back in minneapolis 
this time I think I'm gonna stay. 
 
hey Charley I think I'm happy 
for the first time since my accident 
and I wish I had all the money 
that we used to spend on dope 
I'd buy me a used car lot 
and I wouldn't sell any of em 
I'd just drive a different car 
every day dependin on how 
I feel. 
 
hey Charley 
for chrissakes 
do you want to know 
the truth of it? 
I don't have a husband 
he don't play the trombone 
and I need to borrow money 
to pay this lawyer 
and Charley, hey 
I'll be eligible for parole 
come valentines day.

COLD COLD GROUND

 Crest fallen sidekick in an old cafe 
never slept with a dream before he had to go away 
there's a bell in the tower 
Uncle Ray bought a round 
don't worry about the army 
in the cold cold ground 
now don't be a cry baby 
when there's wood in the shed 
there's a bird in the chimmney 
and a stone in my bed 
when the road's washed out 
they pass the bottle around 
and wait in the arms 
of the cold cold ground 
cold cold ground 
there's a ribbon in the willow 
and a tire swing rope 
and a briar patch of berries 
takin over the slope 
the cat'll sleep in the mailbox 
and we'll never go to town 
til we bury every dream in 
the cold cold ground 
cold cold ground 
gimme a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells 
blow the roof off the goat barn 
let it roll down the hill 
the piano is firewood 
times square is a dream 
I find we'll lay down together in the cold cold ground 
cold cold ground 
cold cold ground 
call the cops on the Breedloves 
bring a bible and a rope 
and a whole box of rebel 
and a bar of soap 
make a pile of trunk tires 
and burn 'em all down 
bring a dollar with you baby 
in the cold cold ground 
cold cold ground 
take a weathervane rooster 
throw rocks at his head 
stop talking to the neighbors 
til we all go dead 
beware of my temper 
and the dog that I've found 
break all the windows in the 
cold cold ground

COLD WATER

 Well I woke up this morning 
With the cold water 
With the cold water 
With the cold water 
Woke up this morning 
With the cold water 
With the cold water 
With the cold 
 
Police at the station 
And they don't look friendly 
Well they don't look friendly 
Well they don't look friendly 
Police at the station 
And they don't look friendly 
They don't look friendly well 
They don't 
 
Blind or crippled 
Sharp or dull 
I'm reading the Bible 
By a 40 watt bulb 
What price freedom 
Dirt is my rug 
Well I sleep like a baby 
With the snakes and the bugs 
 
Well the stores are open 
But I ain't got no money 
I ain't got no money 
Stores are open but I 
Ain't got no money 
Ain't got no money 
Well I ain't 
 
Found an old dog 
And he seems to like me 
Seems to like me 
Well he seems to like me 
Found an old dog and he 
Seems to like me 
Seems to like me 
Well he seems 
 
Seen them fellows 
with the card board signs 
Scrapin up a little $ 
To buy a bottle of wine 
Pregnant women and 
The Vietnam vets I say 
Beggin on the freeway 
Bout as hard as it gets 
 
Well I slept in the graveyard 
It was cool and still 
Cool and still 
It was cool and still 
Slept in the graveyard 
It was cool and still 
Cool and still and it 
Was cool 
 
Slept all night in the Cedar grove 
I was born to ramble 
Born to rove 
Some men are searchin for the 
Holy Grail 
But there ain't nothin sweeter 
Than ridin the rails 
 
I love 47 but I'm 24 
Well they shooed me away 
From here the time before 
Turned there their backs 
And they locked their doors 
I'm watching T.V. in 
The window of a furniture store 
 
Well I woke up this morning 
With the cold water 
With the cold water 
With the cold water 
Woke up this morning 
With the cold water 
With the cold water 
With the cold

COME ON UP TO THE HOUSE

 Well the moon is broken 
And the sky is cracked 
Come on up to the house 
The only things that you can see 
Is all that you lack 
Come on up to the house 
 
All your cryin don't do no good 
Come on up to the house 
Come down off the cross 
We can use the wood 
Come on up to the house 
 
Come on up to the house 
Come on up to the house 
The world is not my home 
I'm just a passin thru 
Come on up to the house 
 
There's no light in the tunnel 
No irons in the fire 
Come on up to the house 
And your singin lead soprano 
In a junkman's choir 
You gotta come on up to the house 
 
Does life seem nasty, brutish and short 
Come on up to the house 
The seas are stormy 
And you can't find no port 
Come on up to the house 
There's nothin in the world 
 
(Chorus) 
there's nothin in the world 
that you can do 
you gotta come on up to the house 
and you been whipped by the forces 
that are inside you 
come on up to the house 
well you're high on top 
of your mountain of woe 
come on up to the house 
well you know you should surrender 
but you can't let go 
you gotta come on up to the house 
(Chorus)

CROSSROADS

 (Tom Waits/William Burroughs) 
 
Now, George was a good straight boy to begin with, but there was bad 
blood 
In him; someway he got into the magic bullets and that leads straight to 
Devil's work, just like marijuana leads to heroin; you think yo ucan take 
Them bullets or leave 'em, do you? 
Just save a few for your bad days 
 
Well, now, we all have those bad days when you can't shoot for shit. 
 
The more of them magics you use, the more bad days you have without 
them 
So it comes down finally to all your days being bad without the bullets 
It's magics or nothing 
Time to stop chippying around and kidding yourself, 
Kid, you're hooked, heavy as lead 
 
And that's where old George found himself 
Out there at the crossroads 
Molding the Devil's bullets 
Now a man figures it's his bullets, so it will 
Hit what he wants to hit 
But it don't always work that way 
 
You see, some bullets is special for a single aim 
A certain stag, or a certain person 
And no matter where you are, that's where the bullet will end up 
And in the moment of aiming, the gun turns into a dowser's wand 
And point where the bullet wants to go 
 
(George Schmid was moving in a series of convulsive spasms, like 
someone 
with an epileptic fit, with his face distorted and his eyes wild like a 
lassoed horse bracing his legs. But something kept pulling him on. And 
now 
he is picking up the skulls and making the circle.) 
 
I guess old George didn't rightly know what he's getting himself into 
The fit was on him and it carried him right to the crossroads

I ain't coming, I ain't going 
My confusion is showing 
Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue 
I'm gonna paint myself blue 
At the depot 
 
I watch the taxis pull up and idle 
I can't claim title to a single memory 
He offered me a key 
'Cause opportunity don't knock 
He has no tongue and she cannot talk 
You're gonna shuffle when you walk 
At the depot 
 
This peeping Tom needs a peephole 
And an uptempo song 
To move me along 
When I find this depot baby 
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball baby 
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe 
At the depot 
 
Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue 
Oh, tell me what a poor boy to do 
At the depot 
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball baby 
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe 
At the depot 
The depot

DIAMONDS & GOLD

 The broken glass 
And the rusty nails 
Where the violets grow 
Say goodbye to the railroad 
And the mad dogs of summer 
And everything that I know 
 
Chorus: 
What some men will do here for diamonds 
What some men will do here for gold 
They're wounded but they just keep on climbin' 
And they sleep by the side of the road 
 
There's a hole in the ladder 
A fence we can climb 
Mad as a hatter 
You're thin as a dime 
Go out to the meadow 
The hills are agreen 
Sing me a rainbo 
Steal me a dream 
. 
Small time Napoleons 
Shattered his knees 
But he stays in the saddle for Rose 
And all his disciple 
They shave in the gutter 
And gather what's left of his clothes 
Chorus 
 
There's a hole in the ladder 
A fence we can climb 
Mad as a hatter 
You're thin as a dime 
Go out to the meadow 
The hills are agreen 
Sing me a rainbow 
Steal me a dream

DIAMONDS ON MY WINDSHIELD

 Well these diamonds on my windshield 
And these tears from heaven 
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate 
I got a steel train in the rain 
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing 
And it's these late nights and this freeway flying 
It always makes me sing 
 
There's a Duster tryin' to change my tune 
He's pulling up fast on the right 
Rolling restlessly by a twenty four hour moon 
 
And a Wisconsin hiker with a cue ball head 
He's wishing he was home in a Wiscosin bed 
But there's fifteen feet of snow in the East 
Colder then a welldigger's ass 
And it's colder than a welldigger's ass 
 
Oceanside it ends the ride with San Clemente coming up 
Those Sunday desperadoes slip by and cruise with a dry back 
And the orange drive in the neon billin' 
And the theatre's fillin' to the brim 
With slave girls and a hot spurn bucket full of sin 
 
Metropolitan area with interchange and connections 
Fly by nights from Riverside 
And out of state plates running a little late 
 
But the sailors jockey for the fast lane 
So 101 don't miss it 
There's rolling hills and concrete fields 
And the broken line's on your mind 
The eights go east and the fives go north 
And the merging nexus back and forth 
You see your sign, cross the line, signalling with a blink 
 
And the radio's gone off the air 
Gives you time to think 
And you hear the rumble 
As you fumble for a cigarette 
And blazing through this midnight jungle 
Remember someone that you met 
And one more block; the engine talks 
Whispers 'home at last' 
It whispers 'home at last' 
Whispers 'home at last' 
It whispers 'home at last' 
Whispers 'home at last' 
 
And there are diamonds on my windshield 
And these tears from heaven 
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate 
I got me a steel train in the rain 
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing 
Late nights and freeway flying 
Always makes me sing 
It always makes me sing 
 
(Hey look here Jack, ok)

DIRT IN THE GROUND

 (Tom Waits/K. Brennan) 
 
What does it matter, a dream of love 
Or a dream of lies 
We're all gonna be in the same place 
When we die 
Your spirit don't leave knowing 
Your face or your name 
And the wind through your bones 
Is all that remains 
And we're all gonna be 
We're all gonna be 
Just dirt in the ground 
 
The quill from a buzzard 
The blood writes the word 
I want to know am I the sky 
Or a bird 
'Cause hell is boiling over 
And heaven is full 
We're chained to the world 
And we all gotta pull 
And we're all gonna be 
Just dirt in the ground 
 
Now the killer was smiling 
With nerves made of stone 
He climbed the stairs 
And the gallows groaned 
And the people's hearts were pounding 
They were throbbing, they were red 
As he swung out ofver the crowd 
I heard the hangman said 
We're all gonna be 
Just dirt in the ground 
 
Now Cain slew Abel 
He killed him with a stone 
The sky cracked open 
And the thunder groaned 
Along a river of flesh 
Can these dry bones live? 
Ask a king or a beggar 
And the answer they'll give 
Is we're all gonna be 
Yea yeah 
We're all gonna be just 
Dirt in the ground

DOWNTOWN TRAIN

 Outside another yellow moon 
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes 
I climb through the window and down the street 
Shining like a new dime 
The downtown trains are full 
With all those Brooklyn girls 
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds 
 
You wave your hand and they scatter like crows 
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart 
They're just thorns without the rose 
Be careful of them in the dark 
Oh if I was the one 
You chose to be your only one 
Oh baby can't you hear me now 
 
Chorus: 
Will I see you tonight 
On a downtown train 
Every night its just the same 
You leave me lonely, now 
I know your window and I know its late 
I know your stairs and your doorway 
I walk down your street and past your gate 
I stand by the light at the four way 
You watch them as they fall 
They stay at the carnival 
But they'll never win you back 
Chorus: 
Will I see you tonight 
On a downtown train 
Where every night its just the same 
You leave me lonely 
Will I see you tonight 
On a downtown train 
All of my dreams just fall like rain 
All upon a downtown train

DRUNK ON THE MOON

 Tight slacked clad girls on the graveyard shift 
'Neath the cement stroll 
Catch the midnight drift 
Cigar chewing charlie 
In that newspaper nest 
grifting hot horse tips 
On who's running the best 
 
CHORUS 
And I'm blinded by the neon 
Don't try and change my tune 
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone 
I'm drunk on the moon 
 
And the moon's a silver slipper 
It's pouring champagne stars 
Broadway's like a serpent 
Pulling shiny top down cars 
Laramer is teeming 
With that undulating beat 
And some Bonneville is screaming 
It's way wilder down the street 
 
CHORUS 
 
Hearts flutter and race 
The moon's on the wane 
Tarts mutter their dream hopes 
The night will ordain 
Come schemers and dancers 
Cherry delight 
As a Cleveland bound Greyhound 
And it cuts throught the night 
 
And I've hawked all my yesterdays 
Don't try and change my tune 
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone 
I'm drunk on the moon

EARTH DIED SCREAMING

 Rudy's on the midway 
And Jacob's in the hole 
THe monkey's on the ladder 
The devil shovels coal 
With crows as big as airplanes 
The lion has three heads 
And someone will eat the skind that he sheds 
ANd the earth died screaming 
The earth died screaming 
While I lay dreaming of you 
 
Well hell doesn't want you 
And heaven is full 
Bring me some water 
Put it in this skull 
I walk between the raindrops 
Wait in Bug House Square 
And the army ants 
They leave nothin' but the bones 
And the earth died screaming 
While I lay dreaming of you 
 
There was thunder 
There was lightning 
Then the stars went out 
And the moon fell from the sky 
It rained mackerel 
It rained trout 
And the great day of wrath has come 
And here's mud in your big red eye 
The poker's in the fire 
And the locusts take the sky 
And the earth died screaming 
While I lay dreaming of you

EGGS AND SAUSAGE (IN A CADILLAC WITH SUSAN MICHELSON)

 nighthawks at the diner 
of Emma's 49er, there's a rendezvous 
of strangers around the coffee urn tonight 
all the gypsy hacks, the insomniacs 
now the paper's been read 
now the waitress said 
 
CHORUS 
eggs and sausage and a side of toast 
coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy 
chile in a bowl with burgers and fries 
what kind of pie? 
 
In a graveyard charade, a late shift masquerade 
2 for a quarter, dime for a dance 
with Woolworth rhinestone diamond 
earrings, and a sideway's glance 
and now the register rings 
and now the waitress sings 
 
CHORUS 
 
the classified section offered no direction 
it's a cold caffeine in a nicotine cloud 
now the touch of your fingers 
lingers burning in my memory 
I've been 86ed from your scheme 
I'm in a melodramatic nocturnal scene 
I'm a refugee from a disconcerted affair 
as the lead pipe morning falls 
and the waitress calls

EMOTIONAL WEATHER REPORT

 late night and early morning low clouds 
with a chance of fog 
chance of showers into the afternoon 
with variable high cloudiness 
and gusty winds, gusty winds 
at times around the corner of 
Sunset and Alvorado 
things are tough all over 
when the thunder storms start 
increasing over the southeast 
and south central portions 
of my apartment, I get upset 
and a line of thunderstorms was 
developing in the early morning 
ahead of a slow moving coldfront 
cold blooded 
with tornado watches issued shortly 
before noon Sunday, for the areas 
including, the western region 
of my mental health 
and the northern portions of my 
ability to deal rationally with my 
disconcerted precarious emotional 
situation, it's cold out there 
colder than a ticket taker's smile 
at the Ivar Theatre, on a Saturday night 
flash flood watches covered the 
southern portion of my disposition 
there was no severe weather well 
into the afternoon, except for a lone gust of 
wind in the bedroom 
in a high pressure zone, covering the eastern 
portion of a small suburban community 
with a 103 and millibar high pressure zone 
and a weak pressure ridge extending from 
my eyes down to my cheeks cause since 
you left me baby 
and put the vice grips on my mental health 
well the extended outlook for an 
indefinite period of time until you 
come back to me baby is high tonight 
low tomorrow, and precipitation is 
expected

EYEBALL KID

 Well Zenora Bariella 
And Coriander Pyle 
They had sixteen children 
In the usual style 
They had a curio museum 
And they had no guile 
All they ever wanted 
Was a show biz child 
So on the 7th of Dec. 1949 
They got what 
They'd been wishing for 
All of the time 
He grew up in a trailer 
By the time he was 9 
He rolled off to join 
The circus... telling fortunes 
On the side 
 
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid 
 
Well the first time I saw him 
Was a Saigon jail 
Cost me 27 dollars 
Just to go his bail 
I said your name will 
Be in lights... 
And that's no doubt 
But you got to have 
A manager that's what 
It's all about 
People would point 
People would stare 
I'll always be here 
To protect you and to 
Cut down on the glare 
I know you can't speak 
I know you can't sign 
So cry right here on 
The dotted line 
 
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid 
 
Well he was born with out a body 
Not even a brow 
I made the kid a promise 
I made the kid a vow 
He's not conventionally handsome 
He'll never be tall 
He said all you got to do is 
Book me into Carnegie Hall 
 
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid 
 
He's just a little bitty thing 
He's just a little guy 
But women go crazy 
For the big blue eye 
They say how does he 
Dream? How does he think 
When he can't ever speak 
And he can't ever blink? 
 
I said Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid 
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid 
 
Give it up and throw me down 
A couple of quic 
Everybody wants to see 
The Eyeball kid 
 
How dies he dream 
How does he think 
When he can't even speak 
And he can't even blink 
We are all lost in the 
Wilderness we're as 
Blind as can be 
He came down to teach us 
How to really see 
 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
 
So give it up and throw 
Me down a couple of quid 
Everybody wants to see 
The Eyeball kid 
Eyeball kid 
Eyeball kid

FILIPINO BOX SPRING HOG

 Well I hung on to Mary's stump 
I danced with a soldier's glee 
With a rum soaked crook 
And a big fat laugh 
I spent my last dollar on thee 
I saw Bill Bones, gave him a yell 
Kehoe spiked the nog 
With a chain link fence 
And a scrap iron jaw 
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring hog 
Spider rolled in from 
Hollister Burn 
With a one eyed stolen Mare 
Donned himself with chicken fat 
Sawin on a jaw bone violin there 
Kathleen was sittin down 
In little reds recovery room 
In her criminal underwear bra 
I was naked to the waist 
With my fierce black hound 
And I'm cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
 
Dig a big pit in a dirt alley road 
Fill it with madrone and bay 
Stinks like hell 
And the neighbors complain 
Don't give a hoot what they say 
Slap that hog 
Gotta roll em over twice 
Baste him with a sweeping broom 
You gotta swat them flies 
And chain up the dogs 
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
 
Rattle snake piccata with grapes and figs 
Old brown Betty with a yellow wig 
Tain't the mince meat filagree 
And it ain't the turkey neck stew 
And it ain't them bruleed 
Okra seeds though she 
Made them especially for you 
Worse won a prize for her 
Bottom black pie 
The beans got to thrown to the dogs 
Jaheseus Christ I can always 
Make room when they're 
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog 
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

FLASH PAN HUNTER

 (Tom Waits/William Burroughs) 
 
The flash pan hunter sways with the wind 
His rifle is the sound of the morning 
Each sulfurous bullet way have it's own wit 
Each cartridge comes with a warning 
Beware of elaborate telescopic meats 
They will find their way back to the forest 
 
CHORUS 
For Wilhelm can't wait 
To be Peg Leg's crown 
As the briar is strangling 
The rose back down 
 
His back shall be my slender new branch 
It will sway and bend in the breeze 
As the devil does his polka 
Wit ha hatchet in his hand 
As a sniper in the branches of the trees 
As the vulture flutters down 
As the snake sheds his dove 
Wilhelm's cutting off his fingers 
So they'll fit into his glove 
 
CHORUS

FOREIGN AFFAIR

 when travelling abroad in the continental style 
it's my belief one must attempt to be discreet 
and subsequently bear in mind your transient position 
allows you a perspective that's unique 
though you'll find your itinerary's a blessing and a curse 
your wanderlust won't let you settle down 
and you'll wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content 
to stay within the city limits of a small midwestern town 
most vagabonds i knowed don't ever want to find the culprit 
that remains the object of their long relentless quest 
the obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending 
the pursuit you see and never the arrest 
 
without fear of contradiction bon voyage is always hollered 
in conjunction with a handkerchief from shore 
by a girl that drives a rambler and furthermore 
is overly concerned that she won't see him anymore 
planes and trains and boats and buses 
characteristically evoke a common attitude of blue 
unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport 
and the cargo that they're carrying is you 
a foreign affair juxtaposed with a stateside 
and domestically approved romantic fancy 
is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances knowing 
it will only be parlayed into a memory

FRANK'S SONG

 That woman will take you, that woman will break you 
That woman will make you something you've never seen 
That woman's got claws, that woman's got laws 
Now look out man, you're gonna loose your mind 
I had a friend, his name was Frank 
He walked on the water and lord he sank 
We used to go stag, now he's got a hag 
It looks like Frank's got a new bag 
That woman will take you, that woman will break you 
That woman will make you something you've never seen 
That woman's got claws, that woman's got laws 
Now look out Frank, you're gonna loose your mind 
What happened to Frank, can happen to you 
Just find you a woman and watch what she'll do 
That woman will take you, that woman's gonna break you 
Look out man you're gonna loose, you're gonna loose your mind

 

TOM WAITS
FRANK'S THEME

 Dream away the tears in your eyes 
Dream away your sorrows 
Dream away all your goodbyes 
Dream away tomorrow 
I promise when the sun comes up 
I promise I'll be true 
and just like before the band starts to play 
they always play your favorite tune 
and dream awawy when everyone's gone 
dream away your grey skies tooo 
dream away and nothing is wrong 
dreams have wishes that are waiting for you 
and up ahead the road is turning 
turning for you and me 
and just like before 
the band starts to play 
now there's that twinkle in your eye 
and dream away

FRANK'S WILD YEARS (FOR FRANKIE Z.)

 Well Frank settled down in the Valley 
and hung his wild years 
on a nail that he drove through 
his wife's forehead 
he sold used office furniture 
out there on San Fernando Road 
and assumed a $30,000 loan 
at 15 1/4 % and put down payment 
on a little two bedroom place 
his wife was a spent piece of used jet trash 
made good bloody marys 
kept her mouth shut most of the time 
had a little Chihuahua named Carlos 
that had some kind of skin disease 
and was totally blind. They had a 
thoroughly modern kitchen 
self cleaning oven (the whole bit) 
Frank drove a little sedan 
they were so happy 
 
One night Frank was on his way home 
from work, stopped at the liquor store, 
picked up a couple Mickey's Big Mouths 
drank 'em in the car on his way 
to the Shell station, he got a gallon of 
gas in a can, drove home, doused 
everything in the house, torched it, 
parked across the street, laughing, 
watching it burn, all Halloween 
orange and chimney red then 
Frank put on a top forty station 
got on the Hollywood Freeway 
headed north 
Never could stand that dog

to the Shell station, he got a gallon of 
gas in a can, drove home, doused 
everything in the house, torched it, 
parked across the street, laughing, 
watching it burn, all Halloween 
orange and chimney red then 
Frank put on a top forty station 
got on the Hollywood Freeway 
headed north 
Never could stand that dog

FUMBLIN' WITH THE BLUES

 Friday left me fumblin' with the blues 
And it's hard to win when you always lose 
Because the nightspots spend your spirit 
Beat your head against the wall 
Two dead ends and you've still got to choose 
 
You know the bartenders 
They all know my name 
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame 
And I'm a pool shooting shimmy shyster shaking my head 
When I should be living clean instead 
 
You know the ladies I've been seeing off and on 
Well they spend your love and then they're gone 
You can't be lovin' someone who is savage and cruel 
Take your love and then they leave on out of town 
No they do 
 
Well now fallin' in love is such a breeze 
But its standin' up that's so hard for me 
I wanna squeeze you but I'm scared to death I'd break your back 
You know your perfume 
Well it won't let me be 
 
You know the bartenders all know my name 
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame 
And I'm a pool shooting shimmy shyster shaking my head 
When I should be living clean instead 
 
Come on baby 
Let your love light shine 
Gotta bury me inside of your fire 
Because your eyes are 'nough to blind me 
You're like a looking at the sun 
You gotta whisper tell me I'm the one 
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one 
Gotta whisper tell me I'm the one 
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one

GEORGIA LEE

 Cold was the night, hard was the ground 
They found her in a small grove of trees 
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found 
She's too young to be out 
On the street. 
 
Why wasn't God watching? 
Why wasn't God listening? 
Why wasn't God there for 
Georgia Lee? 
 
Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia 
From dropping out of school 
I was doing the best that I could 
But she kept runnin away from this world 
These children are so hard to raise good 
 
Why wasn't God watching? 
Why wasn't God listening? 
Why wasn't God there for 
Georgia Lee? 
 
Close your eyes and count to ten 
I will got and hid but then 
Be sure to find me. I want you to find me 
And we'll play all over 
We will play all over again 
 
There's a toad in the witch grass 
There's a crow in the corn 
Wild flowers on a cross by the road 
And somewhere a baby is crying 
For her mom 
As the hills turn from green back 
To gold 
 
Why wasn't God watching? 
Why wasn't God listening? 
Why wasn't God there for 
Georgia Lee?

GET BEHIND THE MULE

 Molly be damned smote Jimmy the Harp 
With a horrid little pistol and a lariat 
She's goin to the bottom 
And she's goin down the drain 
Said she wasn't big enough to carry it 
 
She got to get behind the Mule 
In the morning and plow 
She got to get behind the Mule 
In the morning and plow 
She got to get behind the Mule 
In the morning and plow 
She got to get behind the Mule 
In the morning and plow 
 
Choppity chop goes the axe in the woods 
You gotta meet me by the fall down tree 
Shovel of dirt upon a coffin lid 
And I know they'll come lookin for me boys 
And I know they'll come a lookin for me 
 
Got to get behind the Mule 
In the morning and plow 
Got to get behind the Mule 
In the morning and plow 
Got to get behind the Mule 
In the morning and plow 
Got to get behind the Mule 
In the morning and plow 
 
Big Jack Earl was 8'1 
He stood in the road and he cried 
He couldn't make her love him 
Couldn't make her stay 
But tell the good Lord that he tried 
(Chorus) 
Dusty trail from Atchison to Placerville 
On the wreck of the Weaverville stage 
Beaula fired on Beatty for a lemonade 
I was stirring my brandy with a nail boys 
Stirring my brandy with a nail 
(Chorus) 
Well the rampaging sons of the widow James 
Jack the cutter and the pock marked kid 
Had to stand naked at the bottom 
Of the cross 
And tell the good lord what they did 
Tell the good lord what they did 
(Chorus) 
Punctuated birds on the power line 
In a Studebaker with the Birdie Joe Joaks 
I'm diggin all the way to China 
With a silver spoon 
While the hangman fumbles with the noose, boys 
The hangman fumbles with the noose 
(Chorus) 
Pin your ear to the wisdom post 
Pin your eye to the line 
Never let the weeds get higher 
Than the garden 
Always keep a sapphire in your mind 
Always keep a diamond in your mind 
(Chorus)

GIN SOAKED BOY

but where the hell did you go

you didn't think that I'd know 
with some 
gin soaked boy that you don't know 
 
Well I would bet you as far

Well I'm goin' out west 
Where the wind blows tall 
'Cause Tony Franciosa

They got some money out there 
They're giving it away 
I'm gonna do what I want

And I'm gonna get paid 
 
Little brown sausages 
Lying in the sand 
I ain't no extra baby 
I'm a leading man 
Well my parole officer 
WIll be proud of me 
With my Olds 88 
And the devil on a leash 
My Olds 88 
And the devil on a leash 
 
Well I kno karate, Voodoo too 
I'm gonna make myself available to you 
I don't need no make up 
I got real scars 
I got hair on my chest 
I look good without a shirt 
 
Well I don't lose my composure 
In a high speed chase 
Well my friends think I'm ugly 
I got a masculine face 
I got some dragstrip courage 
I can really drive a bed 
I'm gonna change my name 
To Hannibal or maybe 
Just Rex 
Change my name to Hannibal 
Or maybe just Rex 
 
I'm gonna drive all night 
Take some speed 
I'm gonna wait for the sun 
To shine down on me 
I cut a hole in my roof 
In the shape of a heart 
 
And I'm goin' out west 
Where they'll appreciate me 
Goin' out west 
Goin' out west

GOOD OLD WORLD (WALTZ)

 When I was a boy, the moon was a pearl the sun a yellow gold. 
But when I was a man, the wind blew cold the hills were upside down. 
But now that I have gone from here there's no place I'd rather be 
than to float my chances on the tide Back in the good old world. 
On October's last, I'll fly back home rolling down winding way 
And all I've got's a pocket full of flowers from my grave 
But now summer is gone I remember it best 
Back in the good old world I remember when, she held my hand 
and we walked home alone in the rain how pretty her mouth, how soft 
her hair 
nothing can be the same and there's a rose upon her breast 
where I long to lay my head and her hair was so yellow 
and the wine was so red Back in the good old world.

GRAPEFRUIT MOON

 Grapefruit moon, one star shining, shining down on me. 
Heard that tune, and now I'm pining, honey, can't you see? 
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, something breaks inside, 
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, can't turn back the tide. 
 
Never had no destination, could not get across. 
You became my inspiration, oh but what a cost. 
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, something breaks inside, 
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is more than I can hide. 
 
Now I'm smoking cigarettes and I strive for purity, 
And I slip just like the stars into obscurity. 
'Cause every time I hear that melody, well, puts me up a tree, 
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is all that I can see.

GUN STREET GIRL

 Falling James in the Tahoe mud 
Stick around to tell us all the tail 
He fell in love with a Gun Street Girl and 
Now he's danced in the Birmingham jail. 
 
Took a 100 dollars off a slaughterhouse Joe 
Brought a bran' new michigan 20 gauge 
Got all liquored up on that road house corn, 
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette 
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette. 
Brought a second hand Nova from a Cuban Chinese 
Dyed his hair in the bathroom of Texaco 
With a pawnshop radio, quarter past 4 
Well, he left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door 
He left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door 
 
Chorus: 
I said John, John he's long gone 
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home 
I said John, John he's long gone 
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home. 
Sitting in a sycamore in St. John's Wood 
Soaking' day old bread in kerosene 
He was blue as a robin's egg brown as a hog 
Stayin' out of circulation till the dogs get tire 
Stayin' out of circulation till the dogs get tired 
Shadow fixed the toilet with an old trombone 
He never got up in the morning on a Saturday 
Sittin' by the Erie with a bull whipped dog 
Tellin' everyone he saw 
They went thatta way 
 
Tellin' everyone he saw 
They went thatta way. 
Now the rain's like gravel on old tin roof 
And the Burlinton Northern's pullin' out of the world 
With a head full of bourbon and a dream in the straw. 
And a Gun Street Girl was the cause of it all. 
Riding in the shadow by the St. Joe Ridge 
He heard the click clack tappin' of a blind man's cane 
Pullin' into Baker on New Year's Eve 
With one eye on the pistol the other on the door, 
With one eye on the pistol the other on the door. 
Miss Charlotte took her satchel down to King Row 
And the smuggled in a bran' new pair of alligator shoes. 
With her fireman's raincoat and her long yellow hair, well 
They tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire, 
They tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire. 
 
Chorus 
I said John, John he's long gone 
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home 
I said John, John he's long gone 
Gone to Indiana, ain't never coming home. 
Bangin' on a table with an old tin cup 
Sing I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again, 
I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again. 
Repeat chorus

HEARTATTACK AND VINE

 liar liar with your pants on fire, white spades hangin' on the telephone

doctor lawyer beggar man thief, philly joe remarkable looks on in disbelief, 
if you want a taste of madness, you'll have to wait in line, you'll probably 
see someone you know on heartattack and vine. 
 
boney's high on china white, shorty found a punk, don't you know there ain't 
no devil, there's just god when he's drunk, well this stuff will probably kill 
you, let's do another line, what you say you meet me down on heartattack and 
vine.

sucking on a soda pop, well i bet she's still a virgin but it's only twenty 
five 'til nine, you can see a million of 'em on heartattack and vine. 
 
better off in iowa against your scrambled eggs, than crawling down cahuenga 
on a broken pair of legs, you'll find your ignorance is blissful every goddamn 
time, your're waitin' for the rtd on heartattack and vine.

HOLD ON

 They hung a sign up in out town 
 if you live it up, you won't 
live it down 
So, she left Monte Rio, son 
Just like a bullet leaves a gun 
With charcoal eyes and Monroe hips 
She went and took that California trip 
Well, the moon was gold, her 
Hair like wind 
She said don't look back just 
Come on Jim 
(Chorus) 
Oh you got to 
Hold on, Hold on 
You got to hold on 
Take my hand, I'm standing right here 
You gotta hold on 
 
Well, he gave her a dimestore watch 
And a ring made from a spoon 
Everyone is looking for someone to blame 
But you share my bed, you share my name 
Well, go ahead and call the cops 
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops 
She said baby, I still love you 
Sometimes there's nothin left to do 
 
Oh you got to 
Hold on, hold on 
You got to hold on 
Take my hand, I'm standing right here, you got to 
Just hold on. 
 
Well, God bless your crooked little heart St. Louis got the best of me 
I miss your broken china voice 
How I wish you were still here with me 
 
Well, you build it up, you wreck it down 
You burn your mansion to the ground 
When there's nothing left to keep you here, when 
You're falling behind in this 
Big blue world 
 
Oh you go to 
Hold on, hold on 
You got to hold on 
Take my hand, I'm standing right here 
You got to hold on 
 
Down by the Riverside motel, 
It's 10 below and falling 
By a 99 cent store she closed her eyes 
And started swaying 
But it's so hard to dance that way 
When it's cold and there's no music 
Well your old hometown is so far away 
But, inside your head there's a record 
That's playing, a song called 
 
Hold on, hold on 
You really got to hold on 
Take my hand, I'm standing right here 
And just hold on.

 

TOM WAITS
HOPE I DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU

 Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you 
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue, 
Well the music plays and you display your heart for me to see, 
I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me 
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. 
Well the room is crowded, there's people everywhere 
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair? 
Well if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it, 
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we could make it, 
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. 
I can see that you are lonesome just like me, and it being late, 
You'd like some some company, 
Well I've had two, I look at you, and you look back at me, 
The guy you're with has up and split, the chair next to you's free, 
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me. 
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me. 
Now it's closing time, the music's fading out 
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout. 
Turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found, 
I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round 
And I think that I just fell in love with you.

HOUSE WHERE NOBODY LIVES

 There's a house on my block 
That's abandoned and cold 
Folks moved out of it a 
Long time ago 
And they took all their things 
And they never came back 
Looks like it's haunted 
With the windows all cracked 
And everyone call it 
The house, the house where 
Nobody lives 
 
Once it held laughter 
Once it held dreams 
Did they throw it away 
Did they know what it means 
Did someone's heart break 
Or did someone do somebody wrong? 
 
Well the paint was all cracked 
It was peeled off of the wood 
Papers were stacked on the porch 
Where I stood 
And the weeds had grown up 
Just as high as the door 
There were birds in the chimney 
And an old chest of drawers 
Looks like no one will ever 
Come back to the 
House were nobody lives 
 
Once it held laughter 
Once it held dreams 
Did they throw it away 
Did they know what it means 
Did someone's heart break 
Or did someone do someone wrong? 
So if you find someone 
Someone to have, someone to hold 
Don't trade it for silver 
Don't trade it for gold 
I have all of life's treasures 
And they are fine and they are good 
They remind me that houses 
Are just made of wood 
What makes a house grand 
Ain't the roof or the doors 
If there's love in a house 
It's a palace for sure 
Without love... 
It ain't nothin but a house 
A house where nobody lives 
Without love it ain't nothin 
But a house, a house where 
Nobody lives.

I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OFF WORK (AND SEE MY BABY ON MONTGOMERY AVENUE)

 I don't mind working, 'cause I used to be jerking off most of my time in bars, 
I've been a cabbie and a stock clerk and a soda fountain jock jerk 
And a manic mechanic on cars. 
It's nice work if you can get it, now who the hell said it? 
I got money to spend on my gal, 
But the work never stops, and I'll be busting my chops 
Working for Joe and Sal. 
 
And I can't wait to get off work and see my baby, 
She said she'd leave the porch light on for me. 
I'm disheveled and I'm disdainful and I'm distracted and it's painful, 
But this job sweeping up here is gainfully employing me tonight. 
 
Well Tom, do this and Tom, do that , and Tom, don't do that , 
Count the cash, clean the oven, dump the trash, 
Oh your loving is a rare and a copacetic gift, 
And I'm a moonlight watch manic, it's hard to be romantic 
Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine, 
Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine... 
 
I can't wait to get off work and see my baby 
She'll be waiting up with a magazine for me. 
Clean the bathrooms and clean 'em good, oh your loving I wish you would 
Come down here and sweep a me off my feet, this broom'll have to be my baby, 
If I hurry, I just might get off before the dawn's early light.

I DON'T WANNA GROW UP

 (Tom Waits/K. Brennan) 
 
When I'm lyin' in my bed at night 
I don't wanna grow up 
Nothin' ever seems to turn out right 
I don't wanna grow up 
How do you move in a world of fog 
That's always changing things 
Makes me wish that I could be a dog 
When I see the price that you pay 
I don't wanna grow up 
I don't ever wanna be that way 
I don't wanna grow up 
 
Seems like folks turn into things 
That they'd never want 
The only thing to live for 
Is today 
I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set 
I don't wanna grow up 
Open up the medicine chest 
And I don't wanna grow up 
I don't wnna have to shout it out 
I don't want my hair to fall out 
I don't wanna be filled with doubt 
I don't wanna be a good boy scout 
I don't wanna have to learn to count 
I don't wanna have the biggest amount 
I don't wanna grow up 
 
Well when I see my parents fight 
I don't wanna grow up 
They all go out and drinking all night 
And I don't wanna grow up 
I'd rather stay here in my room 
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom 
I don't wanna live in a big old Tomb 
On Grand Street 
 
When I see the 5 o'clock news 
I don't wanna grow up 
Comb their hair and shine their shoes 
I don't wanna grow up 
Stay around in my old hometown 
I don't wanna put no money down 
I don't wanna get me a big old loan 
Work them fingers to the bone 
I don't wanna float a broom 
Fall in and get married then boom 
How the hell did I get here so soon 
I don't wanna grow up

TOM WAITS
I HOPE THAT I DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU

 Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you 
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue, 
Well the music plays and you display your heart for me to see, 
I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me 
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. 
 
Well the room is crowded, people everywhere 
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair? 
Well if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it, 
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we could make it, 
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. 
 
Well the night does funny things inside a man 
These old tom cat feelings you don't understand, 
Well I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette, 
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met, 
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you. 
 
I can see that you are lonesome just like me, and it being late, 
You'd like some some company, 
Well I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me, 
The guy you're with has up and split, the chair next to you's free, 
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me. 
 
Now it's closing time, the music's fading out 
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout. 
Well I turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found, 
I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round 
And I think that I just fell in love with you.

 

TOM WAITS
I NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS

 stop me if you've heard this one 
i feel as though we've met before 
perhaps i'm mistaken 
but it's just that i remind you 
of someone you used to care about 
but that was long ago 
do you think i'd fall for that 
i wasn't born yesterday 
besides i never talk to strangers anyway 
 
i ain't a bad guy when you get to know me 
i just thought there ain't no harm 
hey just try minding your own business 
bud who asked you to annoy me 
with your sad repartee 
besides i never talk to strangers anyway 
 
your life's a dimestore novel 
this town is full of guys like you 
and you're looking for someone to take the place of her 
and you're bitter cause he left you 
that's why you're drinkin in this bar 
well only suckers fall in love 
with perfect strangers 
 
it always takes one to know one stranger 
maybe we're just wiser now 
and been around the block so many times 
that we don't notice 
that we're all just perfect strangers 
as long as we ignore 
that we all begin as strangers 
just before we find 
we really aren't strangers anymore

 

TOM WAITS
I WANT YOU

 I want you, you, you 
All I want is you, you, you 
All I want is you 
Give you the stars above, Sun on the brightest day 
Give you all my love, if you would only say 
I want you, you, you 
All I want is you, you, you 
All I want is you

I WISH I WAS IN NEW ORLEANS (IN THE NINTH WARD)

 Well, I wish I was in New Orleans, I can see it in my dreams, 
Arm in arm down Burgundy, a bottle and my friends and me 
 
Hoist up a few tall cool ones, play some pool and listen 
To that tenor saxophone calling me home 
And I can hear the band begin When the Saints Go Marching In , 
And by the whiskers on my chin, New Orleans, I'll be there 
 
I'll drink you under the table, be red nosed, go for walks, 
The old haunts what I wants is red beans and rice 
And wear the dress I like so well, and meet me at the old saloon, 
Make sure that there's a Dixie moon, New Orleans, I'll be there 
 
And deal the cards roll the dice, if it ain't that old Chuck E. Weiss, 
And Claiborne Avenue, me and you Sam Jones and all 
 
And I wish I was in New Orleans, 'cause I can see it in my dreams, 
Arm in arm down Burgundy, a bottle and my friends and me 
New Orleans, I'll be there

 

TOM WAITS
I'LL BE GONE

 Tonight I'll shave the mountain 
I'll cut the hearts from pharoahs 
I pull the road off of the rise 
tear the memories from my eyes 
and in the morning I'll be gone 
I drink 1000 shipwrecks 
tonight I'll steal your paychecks 
I paint the sheets across my bed 
the birds will all fly from my head 
and in the morning I'll be gone 
take every dream that's breathing 
find every boot that's leaving 
shoot all the lights in the cafe 
and in the morning I'll be gone 
I bet 1000 dollars 
I have a french companion 
I tie myself below the deck 
I pull the rope around my neck 
and in the morning I'll be gone 
it takes a life to win her 
there is a drum of bourbon 
800 pounds of nitro 
his boots are thunder as he plays 
theree is a stone inside it 
tonight his bones will ride it 
I'll need a tent to hide it 
and in the morning I'll be gone 
and in the morning I'll be gone 
and in the morning I'll be gone

 

TOM WAITS
I'LL SHOOT THE MOON

 I'll shoot the moon 
Right out of the sky 
For you baby 
I'll be the pennies 
On your eyes 
For you baby 
 
I want to take you 
Out to the fair 
Here's a red rose 
Ribbon for your hair 
 
I'll shoot the moon 
Right out of the sky 
For you baby 
I'll shoot the moon 
For you 
 
A vulture circles 
Over your head 
For you baby 
I'll be the flowers 
After you're dead 
For you baby 
 
I want to build 
A nest in your hair 
I want to kiss you 
And never be there 
 
I'll shoot the moon 
Right out of the sky 
For you baby 
I'll shoot the moon 
For you

I'LL TAKE NEW YORK

 I'll tip the newsboy

I'll ride this dream 
to the end of the line 
I'm goin places 
I'll take a ride 
Up to the Riverside 
I'll take NY 
I'll let it happen 
I'll pop the cork 
tear off the wrappin' 
I'll make a splash on the Hudson 
that's how I will arrive 
Hey, do you have two tens for a five? 
Roll out the carpet 
Strike up the band 
break into the best 
champagne when I land 
Beat the parade drum 
hit all the bars 
I want the moon and stars 
But I'll take NY 
I'll make it happen 
Blow out the candlels 
tear off the wrappin' 
And I know someday 
they'll have to name a street after me 
right next door to old Franklin D

IN BETWEEN LOVE

 In between love and trying to scheme love 
Who can tell what we may find 
Never thought love, not get caught love 
Between the magic in your eyes 
And loves like women, it's cool and breezy 
Never thought that love could be so easy 
In between love and trying to scheme love 
And in between love again 
In between love and trying to scheme love 
Who can tell what we may find 
All this time love, I sublime love 
To the feelings in my mind 
Loves like women, it's cool and breezy 
Never thought that love could be so easy 
In between love and trying to scheme love 
And in between love again

 

TOM WAITS
IN THE COLOSSEUM

 (Tom Waits/K. Brennan) 
 
The women all control their men 
With razors and with wrists 
And the princess squeezes grape juice 
On a torrid bloody kiss 
What will you be wearing there 
The lion or the raven hair? 
The flesh will all be tearing 
But the tail will be my own 
In the colosseum tonight 
 
This one's for the balcony 
And this one's for the floor 
As the senators decapitate 
The presidential whore 
The bald headed senators 
Are splashing in the blood 
The dogs are having someone 
WHo is screaming in the mud 
In the colosseum tonight 
 
Now it's raining and it's pouring 
On the pillaging and goring 
The constable is swinging 
>From the chains 
For the dead there is no story 
No memory no blame 
Their families shout blue murder 
But tomorrow it's the same 
In the colosseum 
 
A slowly acting poison 
Will be given to the favorite one 
THe dark horse will bring glory 
To the jailer and his men 
It's always much more sporting 
When there's families in the pit 
And the madness of the crowd 
Is an epileptic fit 
In the colosseum 
 
No justice here, no liberty 
No reason, no blame 
There's no cause to taint the sweetest taste of blood 
And greetings from the nation 
As we shake the hands of time 
They're taking their ovations 
The vultures stay behind 
In the colosseum, in the colosseum 
In the colosseum tonight

 

TOM WAITS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

 Well the eggs chase the bacon 
round the fryin' pan 
and the whinin' dog pidgeons 
by the steeple bell rope 
and the dogs tipped the garbage pails 
over last night 
and there's always construction work 
bothering you 
In the neighborhood 
In the neighborhood 
In the neighborhood 
 
Friday's a funeral 
and Saturday's a bride 
Sey's got a pistol on the register side 
and the goddamn delivery trucks 
they make too much noise 
and we don't get our butter 
delivered no more 
In the neighborhood 
In the neighborhood 
In the neighborhood 
 
Well Big Mambo's kicking 
his old grey hound 
and the kids can't get ice cream 
'cause the market burned down 
and the newspaper sleeping bags 
blow down the lane 
and that goddamn flatbed's 
got me pinned in again 
In the neighborhood 
In the neighborhood 
In the neighborhood 
 
There's a couple Filipino girls 
gigglin' by the church 
and the windoe is busted 
and the landlord ain't home 
and Butch joined the army 
yea that's where he's been 
and the jackhammer's diggin' 
up the sidewalks again 
In the neighborhood 
In the neighborhood 
In the neighborhood

INNOCENT WHEN YOU DREAM (BARROOM)

 The bats are in the belfry 
the dew is on the moor 
where are the arms that held me 
and pledged her love before 
and pledged her love before 
 
CHORUS 
 
It's such a sad old feeling 
the fields are soft and green 
it's memories that I'm stealing 
but you're innocent when you dream 
when you dream 
you're innocent when you dream 
 
Running through the graveyard 
we laughed my friends and I 
we swore we'd be together 
until the day we died 
until the day we died 
 
CHORUS 
 
I made a golden promise 
that we would never part 
I gave my love a locket 
and then I broke her heart 
and then I broke her heart 
 
CHORUS

INVITATION TO THE BLUES

 Well she's up against the register with an apron and a spatula, 
Yesterday's deliveries, tickets for the bachelors 
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes, 
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues 
 
And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth 
At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore 
You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle 
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue 
 
She said How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled? , 
You say Anyway's the only way , be careful not to gamble 
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here 
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes 
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues 
 
But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java, 
It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers 
Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey 
But a broken down jalopy of a man I left behind 
And the dream that I was chasing, and a battle with booze 
And an open invitation to the blues 
 
But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy apple Caddy, 
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things 
He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't 'cept at night, 
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared 
So they took the registration, and the car keys and her shoes 
And left her with an invitation to the blues 
 
'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening 
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while 
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring, 
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose? 
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay? now I gotta choose, 
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues

 

TOM WAITS

JESUS GONNA BE HERE

 Well, Jesus will be here

With a promise and a vow 
And a lullaby for my brow

JITTERBURG BOYS

 Well, I'm a jitterbug boy, by the shoe shine 
Resting on my laurels and my hardys too 
Life of Riley on a swing shift, gears follow my drift 
Once upon a time I was in show biz too 
I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers playing at Ebbets Field 
Seen the Kentucky Derby too 
It's fast women, slow horses, unreliable sources, 
And I'm holding up the lamp post if you want to know 
I've seen the Wabash Cannonball, buddy, I've done it all 
'Cause I slept with the lions and Marilyn Monroe, 
Had breakfast in the eye of a hurricane 
Fought Rocky Marciano, played Minnesota Fats, 
Burned hundred dollar bills, I've eaten Mulligan stew 
Got drunk with Louis Armstrong, what's that old song? 
I taught Mickey Mantle everything that he knows 
So you ask me what I'm doing here holding up the lamp post, 
Flipping this quarter, trying to make up my mind 
And if it's heads I go to Tennessee, and tails I buy a drink, 
If it lands on the edge I keep talking to you 
(scat)

 

TOM WAITS
JOCKEY FULL OF BOURBON

 Edna Million in a drop dead suit 
Dutch pink pink on a downtown train 
Two dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot 
I'm in the corner in the pouring rain 
16 men on a deadman's chest 
And I've been drinking from a broken cup 
2 pairs of pants and a mother vest 
I'm full of bourbon; I can't stand up. 
 
Chorus: 
Hey little bird, fly away home 
Your house is on fire; your children are alone 
Hey little bird, fly away home 
Your house is on fire; your children are alone 
Schiffer broke a bottle on Morgan's head 
And I've been stepping on the devil's tail 
Across the stripes of full moon's head 
Through the bars of a Cuban jail 
Bloody fingers on a purple knife 
A flamingo drinking from a cocktail glass 
I'm on the lawn with someone else's wife 
Come admire the view from up on top of the mast 
 
Chorus

JOCKEY FULL OF BOURBON

 Edna Million in a drop dead suit 
Dutch pink pink on a downtown train 
Two dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot 
I'm in the corner in the pouring rain 
16 men on a deadman's chest 
And I've been drinking from a broken cup 
2 pairs of pants and a mother vest 
I'm full of bourbon; I can't stand up. 
 
Chorus: 
Hey little bird, fly away home 
Your house is on fire; your children are alone 
Hey little bird, fly away home 
Your house is on fire; your children are alone 
Schiffer broke a bottle on Morgan's head 
And I've been stepping on the devil's tail 
Across the stripes of full moon's head 
Through the bars of a Cuban jail 
Bloody fingers on a purple knife 
A flamingo drinking from a cocktail glass 
I'm on the lawn with someone else's wife 
Come admire the view from up on top of the mast 
 
Chorus 
 
Yellow sheets in Hong Kong bed 
Stazybo horn and a Singerland ride 
To the carnival is what she said 
A hundred dollars makes it dark inside.

 She's my only true love 
she's all that I think of 
look here in my wallet 
that's her 
She grew up on a farm there 
there's a place on my arm 
where I've written her name 
next to mine 
you see I just can't 
live without her 
and I'm her only boy 
and she grew up outside McHenry

JUST THE RIGHT BULLETS

 There is a light in the forest 
There is a face in the tree 
I'll pull you out of the chorus 
And the first one's always free 
 
You can never go hunting 
With just a flintlock and a hound 
You won't go home with a bunting 
If you blow a hundred rounds 
 
It takes much more than wild courage 
Or you'll hit just the tattered clouds 
You must have just the right bullets 
And the first one's always free 
 
You must be careful in the forest 
Broken glass and rusty nails 
If you're to bring back something for us 
I have bullets for sale 
 
Why be a fool when you can chase away 
Your blind and your gloom 
I have blessed each one of these bullets 
And they shine just like a spoon 
 
To have sixty silver wishes 
Is a small price to pay 
They'll be your private little fishes 
And they'll never swim away 
 
I just want you to be happy 
That's my only wish 
I'll fix your wagon and your musket 
And the spoon will have his dish 
 
And I shudder at the thought of your 
Poor empty hunter's pouch 
So I'll keep the wind from your barrel 
And bless the roof of your house

 Little trip to heaven on the wings of your love 
Banana moon is shining in the sky 
I feel like I'm in heaven when your with me 
I know that I'm in heaven when you smile 
Though were stuck here on the ground 
I got something that I've found, and it's you 
I don't need to take no trip to outer space 
All I have to do is look in your face 
And before I know it I'm in orbit around you 
Thanking my lucky stars that I found you 
When I see your constellation, your my inspiration 
And it's you 
Your my North Star when I'm lost and feeling blue 
Your my sun that's breaking through, it's true 
And all the other stars seem dim around you 
I thank my lucky stars that I found you 
When I see your smilin face 
I know nothing' gonna take your place 
And it's you, and it's you, and it's you, and it's you, and it's you, and it's you

LOOK'S LIKE I'M UP SHIT CREEK AGAIN

 Well the sun came in my window Wednesday morning 
And your love was like the golden rays again 
Now I'm lying here on a Thursday, and you're lovin someone new 
And it looks like I'm up shit creek again 
And I can't help thinking of your lovin ways 
And I cried a quart of tears since you've been gone 
And I can't face the morning by myself love 
And it looks like I'm up shit creek again 
Since you've been gone, I cry all the time 
And I cannot stand leavin you behind 
So I'll pull myself together, And I'll dry away my tears 
But the morning light has brought back memories 
And I can't face the morning by myself love 
And it looks like I'm up shit creek again 
So I'm out a walkin on this dusty highway 
Cause you've given me no reason for to stay 
And I'll walk until I've found someone who loves me not in vain 
And it looks like I'm up shit creek again 
And it looks like I'm up shit creek again

LOWSIDE OF THE ROAD

 I'm on a black elevator 
Goin down 
Little Joe from Kokomo 
It rattles to the ground 
The dice is laughin at the 
man that he throwed 
Your rollin over to the 
Lowside of the road. 
 
The moon is red and your 
Dancin real slow 
29 miles left to go 
The chain momkeys 
Help you with your load 
You're rollin over to the 
Lowside of the road 
 
Jezebel is naked 
With an axe 
The prosecution tell you 
To relax 
Your head feels like it's ready 
To explode 
You're rollin over, you're rollin over 
 
Well the clapper has been ripped 
Out of the bell 
The flapper has been kicked right 
Out of hell 
When the horse whips the 
Man that he rode 
You're rollin over to the Lowside of the road 
 
The dog won't bite if you beat 
Him with a bone 
She's so shy when she's 
Talkin on the phone 
The round rises up and starts to groan 
You're rollin over to the 
Lowside of the road

LUCKY DAY

 The prettiest girl 
In all the world 
Is in a little Spanish town 
But I left her for a Bonnie lass 
And I told her 
I'd see her around 
But that Bonnie lass 
And her heart of glass 
Would not hold a candle 
 
To bumming around 
So don't cry for me 
For I'm going away 
And I'll be back some lucky day 
 
Tell the boys back home 
I'm doing just fine 
I left my troubles and woe 
So sing about me 
For I can't come home 
I've many more miles to go 
 
Why, there's Miss Kelsey 
You taught dance at our school 
And old Johnny O'Toole 
I'll still beat you at pool 
So don't cry for me 
For I'm going away 
ANd I'll be back some lucky day 
 
Now when I was a boy 
My daddy sat me on his knee 
And he told me 
He told me many things 
And he said sone 
There's a lot of things in this world 
You're gonna have no use for 
ANd when you get blue 
And you've lost all your dreams 
There's nothin' like a campfire 
And a can of beans 
 
Why, there's Miss Kelsey 
She taught dance at our school 
And old Johnny O'Toole 
I'll still beat you at pool 
So don't cry for me 
For I'm going away 
And I'll be back some lucky day

MARTHA

 Operator, number, please: it's been so many years 
Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears? 
Hello, hello there, is this Martha? this is old Tom Frost, 
And I am calling long distance, don't worry 'bout the cost. 
'Cause it's been forty years or more, now Martha please recall, 
Meet me out for coffee, where we'll talk about it all. 
 
And those were the days of roses, poetry and prose 
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me. 
There was no tomorrows, we'd packed away our sorrows 
And we saved them for a rainy day. 
 
And I feel so much older now, and you're much older too, 
How's your husband? and how's the kids? you know that I got married too? 
Luck that you found someone to make you feel secure, 
'Cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature. 
 
And those were the days of roses, poetry and prose 
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me. 
There was no tomorrows, we'd packed away our sorrows 
And we saved them for a rainy day. 
 
And I was always so impulsive, I guess that I still am, 
And all that really mattered then was that I was a man. 
I guess that our being together was never meant to be. 
And Martha, Martha, I love you can't you see? 
 
And those were the days of roses, poetry and prose 
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me. 
There was no tomorrows, we'd packed away our sorrows 
And we saved them for a rainy day. 
 
And I remember quiet evenings trembling close to you...

MIDNIGHT LULLABY

 Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye 
Hush a bye my baby, no need to be crying. 
You can burn the midnight oil with me as long as you will 
Stare out at the moon upon the windowsill, and dream... 
 
Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye 
Hush a bye my baby, no need to be crying. 
There's dew drops on the window sill, gumdrops in your head 
Slipping into dream land, you're nodding your head, so dream... 
 
Dream of West Virginia, or of the British Isles 
'Cause when you are dreaming, you see for miles and miles. 
When you are much older, remember when we sat 
At midnight on the windowsill, and had this little chat 
And dream, come on and dream, come on and dream, and dream, and dream...

And dream sing a song a sixpence, pocket full a wry 
I tell you another story, tell you no lie 
Dew drops on the window sill, gum drops in your hair 
Your slippin into dreamland, Your noddin' your head 
Oh dream 
Dream of West Virginia, of the British Isles

 Mocking Bird high in a tree 
Looks like you got the best of me 
Mocking Bird singing his song 
Well Mocking Bird mocking me now that you're gone 
Mocking Bird high in a loof 
Well he's blowing notes on top my roof 
Mocking Bird singing his song 
Well Mocking Bird mocking me now that you're gone. 
Mocking Bird high in a tree 
Looking up at you, you're looking down at me 
Mocking Bird high in a loof 
Well he's blowing notes on top my roof. 
Mocking Bird high in a tree 
Looking up at you, you're looking down at me 
Mocking Bird singing his song 
Well Mocking Bird mocking me now that you're gone. 
Throwed some papers, tried to scare him away 
Just looked down at me and this is what he said 
Mocking Bird high in a tree 
Looks like you got the best of me 
Mocking Bird singing his song 
Well Mocking Bird mocking me now that you're gone

MORE THAN RAIN

 It's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight 
it's more than thunder it's more than thunder 
it's more than a swindle this crooked card game

none of our pockets are filled with gold 
nobody's caught the boquet 
there are no dead presidents we can fold 
nothing is going our way 
and it's more than goodbye I have to say to you 
it's more than woe be gotten grey skies now

 i spent all my money in a mexican whorehouse, across the street from a 
catholic church, and then i wiped off my revolver, and i buttoned up my 
burgundy shirt, i shot the morning in the back, with my red wings on, i told 
the sun he'd better go back down, and if i can find a book of matches, i'm 
goin' to burn this hotel down. 
 
you got to tell me brave captain, why are the wicked so strong, how do the 
angels get to sleep, when the devil leaves the porchlight on. 
 
well i dropped thirty grand on the nugget slots, i had to sell my ass on 
fremont street, and the drummer said there's sanctuary, over at the bagdad 
room, and now it's one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, 
and go man go, i said tell me mr. siegel, how do i get out of here. 
 
well willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat, drivin' dangerous curves 
across the dirty sheets, he said man you ought to see her, when her parents 
are gone, man you ought to hear her when the siren's on. 
 
you got to tell me brave captain, why are the wicked so strong, how do the

headlights, on the other side of the nevada line, where they live hard die 
young, and have a good lookin' corpse every time, well the pit boss said i 
should keep movin', this is where you go when you die, and so i shot a black 
beauty, and i kissed her right between the eyes.

MURDER IN THE RED BARN

 (Tom Waits/K. Brennan) 
 
There was a murder in the red barn 
Murder in the red barn 
 
The trees are bending over 
The cows are lying down 
The atumn's taking over 
You can hear the buckshot hounds 
The watchman said to Reba the loon 
Was it pale at Manzanita 
Or Blind Bob the raccoon? 
Pin it on a drifter 
They sleep beneath the bridge 
One plays the violin 
And sleeps inside a fridge 
There was a murder in the red barn 
A murder in the red barn 
 
Someone's crying in the woods 
Someone's burying all his clothes 
Now Slam the Crank from Wheezer 
Slept outside last night and froze 
Road kill has its seasons 
Just like anything 
It's possums in the autumn 
And it's farm cats in the spring 
There was a murder in the red barn 
A murder in the red barn 
 
Now thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house 
Or covet thy neighbor's wife 
But for some 
Murder is the only door through which they enter life 
 
Now they surrounded the house 
They smoke him out 
They took him off in chains 
The sky turned black and bruised 
And we had months of heavy rains 
Now the raven's nest in the rotted roof 
Of Chenoweth's old place 
And no one's asking Cal 
About that scar upon his face 
'Cause there's nothin' strange 
About an axe with bloodstains in the barn 
 
There's always some killin' 
You got to do around the farm 
A murder in the red barn 
Murder in the red barn 
 
Now the woods will never tell 
What sleeps beneath the trees 
Or what's buried 'neath a rock 
Or hiding in the leaves 
'Cause road kill has it's seasons 
Just like anything 
It's possums in the atumn 
And it's farm cats in the spring 
A murder in the red barn 
A murder in the red barn 
 
Now a lady can't do ntohin' 
Without folks' tongues waggin' 
Is this blood on the tree 
Or is it autumn's red blaze 
When the ground's soft for diggin' 
ANd the rain will bring all this gloom 
There's nothing wrong with a lady 
Drinking alone in her room 
But there was a murder in the red barn 
A murder in the red barn

MURIEL

 muriel since you left town the clubs closed down 
and there's one more burned out lamppost down on the main street

and you follow me wherever i go 
and muriel i see you on a saturday night 
in a penny arcade with your hair tied back 
and the diamond twinkle in your eye 
is the only wedding ring i'll buy you 
muriel 
 
and muriel how many times i've left this town 
to hide from your memory 
and it haunts me 
but i only get as far as the next whiskey bar

NEW COAT OF PAINT

 Let's put a new coat of paint on this lonesome old town 
Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' em down. 
You wear a dress, baby, and I'll wear a tie. 
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon in that burgundy sky 
 
All your scribbled lovedreams, are lost or thrown away, 
Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowing day 
Our love needs a transfusion so let's shoot it full of wine 
Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin'in your line.

NIGHTHAWK POSTCARDS (FROM EASY STREET)

 there's a blur drizzle down the plateglass 
as a neon swizzle stick stirrin up the sultry night air 
and a yellow biscuit of a buttery cue ball moon 
rollin' maverick across an obsidian sky 
as the busses go groanin' and wheezin', 
down on the corner I'm freezin'; 
on a restless boulevard at a midnight road 
I'm across town from EASY STREET 
with the tight knots of moviegoers and out of towners on the stroll 
and the buildings towering high above 
lit like dominoes or black dice 
all the used car salesmen dressed up in Purina Checkerboard slacks 
and Foster Grant wrap around, 
pacing in front of EARL SCHLEIB $39.95 merchandise 
like barkers at a shootin' gallery 
they throw out kind of a Texas Guinan routine 
 Hello sucker, we like your money 
just as well as anybody else's here 
or they give you the P.T. Barnum bit 
 There's a sucker born every minute 
you just happened to be comin' along at the right time 
come over here now 
you know... all the harlequin sailors are on the stroll 
in a search of LIKE NEW, NEW PAINT, 
decent factory air and AM FM dreams 
and the piss yellow gypsy cabs 
stacked up in the taxi zones waitin' like pinball machines 
to be ticking off a joy ride to a magical place 
waitin' in line like truckers welcome diners 
with dirt lots full of 
Peterbilts, Kenworths, Jimmy's and the like, and 
they're hiballin' with bankrupt brakes, over driven 
under paid, over fed, a day late and a dollar short 
but Christ I got my lips around a bottle and 
my foot on the throttle and I'm standin' on the corner 
standin' on the corner like a just in town 
jasper, on a street corner with a gasper lookin' 
for some kind of Cheshire billboard grin 
stroking a goateed chin, and using parking meters 
as walking sticks on the inebriated stroll 
with my eyelids propped open at half mast 
but you know... over at Chubb's Pool Hall and Snooker 
it was a nickle after two, yea it was a nickle after two 
and in the cobalt steel blue dream smoke, it 
was the radio that groaned out the hit parade 
and the chalk squeaked, the floorboards creaked 
and an Olympia sign winked through a torn yellow 
shade, old Jack Chance himself leanin' up against 
a Wurlitzer and eyeballin' out a 5 ball combination shot 
impossible you say? ...hard to believe?, perhaps 
out of the realm of possibility? naaaa 
he be stretchin' out long tawny fingers out across a 
cool green felt with a provocative golden gate 
and a full table railshot that's no sweat and I leaned 
up against my bannister and wandered over to the 
Wurlitzer and I punched A 2 I was lookin' for 
something like Wine, Wine, Wine by the Night Caps 
starring Chuck E. Weiss or High Blood Pressure 
by George (cryin' in the streets) Perkins no dice 
 that's life, that's what all the people say ridin' high 
in April, seriously shot down in May, but I know I'm 
gonna change that tune when I'm standing underneath 
a buttery moon that's all melted off to one side 
It was just about that time that the sun 
came crawlin' yellow out of a manhole 
at the foot of 23rd Street 
and a dracula moon in a black disguise 
was making its way back to its 
pre paid room at the St. Moritz Hotel (scat) 
and the El train came tumbling 
across the trestles and it sounded 
like the ghost of Gene Krupa 
with an overhead cam and glasspacks 
and the whispering brushes of wet radials 
on a wet pavement and there's a 
traffic jam session on Belmont tonight 
and the rhapsody of the pending 
evening, I leaned up against 
my bannister and I've been looking 
for some kind of an emotional 
investment with romantic dividends 
kind of a physical negociation 
is underway 
as I attempt to consolidate all my 
missed weekly payments, into 
one low monthly payment 
through the nose 
with romantic residuals and leg akimbo 
but the chances are more than likely I'll probably 
be held over for another smashed weekend

NOBODY

 Nobody, Nobody

the way I could love you 
cause nobody is that strong 
love is bitter sweet 
and life's treasures deep 
but no one can keep 
a love that's gone wrong

you'll have many others

your poor heart in two

NOVEMBER

 No shadow 
No stars 
No moon 
No care 
November 
It only believes 
In a pile of dead leaves 
And a moon 
That's the color of bone 
 
No prayers for November 
To linger longer 
Stick your spoon in the wall 
We'll slaughter them all 
 
November has tied me 
To an old dead tree 
Get word to April 
To rescue me 
November's cold chain 
 
Made of wet boots and rain 
And shiny black ravens 
On chimney smoke lanes 
November seems odd 
You're my firing squad 
November 
 
With my hair slicked back 
With carrion shellac 
With the blood from a pheasant 
And the bone from a hare 
 
Tied to the branches 
Of a roebuck stag 
Left to wave in the timber 
Like a buck shot flag 
 
Go away you rainsnout 
Go away, blow your brains out 
November

OL' 55

 Well my time went so quickly, I went lickety splickly out to my old '55 
As I drove away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive. 
 
Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks, 
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade 
Just a wishing I'd stayed a little longer, 
Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger. 
 
And it's six in the morning, gave me no warning; I had to be on my way. 
Well there's trucks all a passing me, and the lights are all flashing, 
I'm on my way home from your place. 
 
And now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks, 
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade 
Just a wishing I'd stayed a little longer, 
Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger. 
 
And my time went so quickly, I went lickety splickly out to my old '55 
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive.

OLD SHOES

 Well I'm singing this song, cause it's time it was sung 
I've been putting it off for a while, 
Cause it's harder by now, and the truth is so clear 
That I am crying when I'm seeing you smile. 
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear 
And your tears cannot bind me anymore, 
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes 
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone. 
And every time that I tried to tell you that we'd lost the magic we had at the start, 
I would weep my heart when I looked in your eyes 
And I searched once again for the spark. 
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear 
And your tears cannot bind me anymore, 
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes 
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone. 
Oh you know that there's something calling me dear 
and by morning, I'm sure to be gone 
For I'm older than you and you know so well 
That our time for to love was a song 
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear 
And your tears cannot bind me anymore, 
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes 
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone. 
Now I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go 
So I'll leave you crying in the rain, 
Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy 
Honey my heart was not born to be tamed. 
And goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear 
And your tears cannot bind me anymore, 
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes 
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone. 
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

ON A FOGGY NIGHT

 on a foggy night, an abandoned road 
in a twilight mirror mirage 
with no indication of a service station 
or an all night garage, I was misinformed 
I was misdirected cause the interchange 
never intersected leaving me marooned 
beneath a bloodshot moon 
all upon a foggy night, on a foggy night 
an abandoned road, in a blurred brocade 
collage, is that a road motel? 
I can't really tell, is that what you 
might call some kind of a vacancy lodge 
cause there's no consolation, what 
kind of situation to be aimlessly skewed 
amidst a powder blue? 
no tell tail light clue 
spun like the spell you spin 
this precarious pandemonium 
I'm stranded, all upon a foggy night 
all upon a foggy night 
on a foggy night

 

TOM WAITS
ON THE NICKEL

 sticks and stones will break my bones, but i always will be true, and when 
your mama is dead and gone, i'll sing this lullabye just for you, and what 
becomes of all the little boys, who never comb their hair, well they're lined 
up all around the block, on the nickel over there. 
 
so you better bring a bucket, there is a hole in the pail, and if you don't 
get my letter, then you'll know that i'm in jail, and what becomes of all the 
little boys, who never say their prayers, well they're sleepin' like a baby, 
on the nickel over there. 
 
and if you chew tobacco, and wish upon a star, well you'll find out where 
the scarecrows sit, just like punchlines between the cars, and i know a place 
where a royal flush, can never beat a pair, and even thomas jefferson, is on 
the nickel over there. 
 
so ring around the rosie, you're sleepin' in the rain, and you're always 
late for supper, and man you let me down again, i thought i heard a 
mockingbird, roosevelt knows where, you can skip the light, with grady tuck, 
on the nickel over there. 
 
so what becomes of all the little boys, who run away from home, well the 
world just keeps gettin' bigger, once you get out on your own, so here's to 
all the little boys, the sandman takes you where, you'll be sleepin' with a 
pillowman, on the nickel over there. 
 
so let's climb up through that button hole, and we'll fall right up the 
stairs, and i'll show you where the short dogs grow, on the nickel over there

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD

 There's a blue eyed girl with a red bow tie 
and a string of pearls with one good eye 
in a rainy town the chimney smoke will curl 
no one likes clowns on the other side of the world 
and the children know she'll never let me go. 
 
there's a one legged priest that tangos with the farmers wife 
Beauty and the beast is taking her own life 
and a tear on a letter back home turns into a lake of your own 
and a crow turns into a girl on the other side of the world 
and she tastes like the sea and she's waiting for me 
 
in the spring the weeds will show that he brought back the only rose 
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world. 
And I drink champagne from your thin blue veins 
 
She visits his grave wearing her mother's shawl 
should I shave or end it all. 
There's an old sailor song that the children know 
as their fingers curl around the other side of the world 
on a bone white mare lost in Kathleen's hair 
 
in the spring the weeds will show that he brought back the only rose 
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world.

PASTIES AND A G STRING (AT THE TWO O'CLOCK CLUB)

 Smelling like a brewery, looking like a tramp, 
I ain't got a quarter, got a postage stamp 
Been five o'clock shadow boxing all around the town, 
Talking with the old man, sleeping on the ground 
Bazanti bootin al zootin al hoot and Al Cohn 
Sharing this apartment with a telephone pole 
And a fish net stocking, spike heel shoes, 
Strip tease, prick tease, car keys blues 
And the porno floor show, live nude girls, 
Dreamy and creamy and brunette curls 
Chesty Morgan and Watermelon Rose 
Raise my rent and take off all your clothes 
With trench coats, magazines, a bottle full of rum, 
She's so good, make a dead man come 
Pasties and a G string, beer and a shot 
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze 
Wrinkles and Cherry and Twinkie and Pinkie and Fifi live from Gay Paree 
Fanfares, rim shots, back stage, who cares, all this hot burlesque for me 
(scat) 
 
Cleavage, cleavage, thighs and hips 
From the nape of her neck to the lipstick lips 
Chopped and channeled and lowered and lewd 
And the cheater slicks and baby moons 
She's a hot and ready, creamy and sugared 
And the band is awful and so are the tunes 
(scat) 
 
Crawling on her belly, and shaking like jelly, 
And I'm getting harder than Chinese algebrassieres 
And cheers from the (hmm) compendium here 
 Hey sweetheart they're yelling for more 
You're squashing out your cigarette butts on the floor 
And I like Shelly, and you like Jane 
And what was the girl with the snakeskin's name? 
And it's an early bird matinee, come back any day, 
Get you a little something that you can't get at home 
Get you a little something that you can't get at home 
It's pasties and a G string, beer and a shot 
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze 
Popcorn, front row, higher than a kite, and I'll be back tomorrow night, 
And I'll be back tomorrow night 
(scat)

PLEASE CALL ME, BABY

 The evening fell just like a star 
Left a trail behind 
You spit as you slammed out the door 
If this is love we're crazy 
As we fight like cats and dogs 
But I just know there's got to be more 
 
CHORUS 
So please call me, baby 
Wherever you are 
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets 
We do crazy things when we're wounded 
Everyone's a bit insane 
I don't want you catching your death of cold 
Out walking in the rain 
 
And I admit that I ain't no angel 
I admit that I ain't no saint 
I'm selfish and I'm cruel but you're blind 
If I exorcise my devils 
Well my angels may leave too 
When they leave they're so hard to find 
 
CHORUS 
 
And we're always at each other's throats 
You know it drives me up the wall 
But most of the time I'm just blowing off steam 
And I wish to God you'd leave me 
Baby I wish to God you'd stay 
Life's so different than it is in your dreams 
 
CHORUS

PLEASE WAKE ME UP

 I put my chips on her shoulder 
running in the carnival time 
she bought the things that I told her 
they made her eyes sparkle and shine 
together we'll ring in the new year 
I know that she'll be my queen 
and if I fall asleep in your arms 
please wake me up in my dreams 
Her out fit was all made of vinyl 
like nothing I've ever seen 
when our divorces are final 
She'll fit right into my scheme 
next to the pawnshop's a chapel 
I'll show you just what I mean 
and if I fall asleep in your arms 
please wake me up in my dreams

PONCHO'S LAMENT

 Well the stairs sound so lonely without you 
And I ain't maid my bed in a week 
Coffee stains on the paper I'm writing 
And I'm too choked up inside to speak 
And Yes, I know our differences pulled us apart 
Never spoke a word heart to heart 
And I'm glad that you're gone 
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home 
And I'm glad that you're gone 
Got the feeling so strong 
And I'm glad that you're gone 
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home 
Well my guitar still plays your favorite song 
though the strings have been outta tune for some time 
Every time I strum a cord, I pray out to the lord 
That you'll quit your honkey tonkin' sing my song 
And I'm glad that you're gone 
Got the feeling so strong 
And I'm glad that you're gone 
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home 
So I'll throw another log onto the fire 
And I'll admit I'm a lousy liar 
As the coals die down and flicker 
I hear that guitar picker 
Play the song we used to sing so long ago 
I'm glad that you're gone 
Got the feeling so strong 
And I'm glad that you're gone 
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home 
And I'm glad, damn glad you're gone 
Got the feeling so strong 
And I'm glad that you're gone 
But I wish to the lord that you'd come home

PONY

 I've seen it all boys 
I've been all over 
Been everywhere in the 
Whole wide world 
I rode the high line 
With old blind Darby 
I danced real slow 
With Ida Jane 
 
I was full of wonder 
When I left Murfreesboro 
Now I am full of hollow 
On Maxwell street... 
And I hope my Pony 
I hope my Pony 
I hope my Pony 
Knows the way back home 
 
I walked from Natcher 
To Hushpukena 
I built a fire by the side 
Of the road 
I worked for nothin in a 
Belzoni saw mill. I caught a 
Blind out on the B and O 
Talullah's friendly Belzoni ain't so 
A 44'll get you 99 
 
And I hope my Pony 
I hope my Pony 
I hope my Pony 
Knows the way back home 
 
I run my race with burnt face Jake 
Gave him a Manzanita cross 
I lived on nothin 
But dreams and train smoke 
Somehow my watch and chain 
Got lost. 
I wish I was home in Evelyn's Kitchen 
With old Gyp curled around my feet 
(Chorus)

POTTER'S FIELD

 well you can buy me a drink and i'll tell you what i seen 
and i'll give you a bargain from the edge of a maniac's dream 
that buys a black widow spider with a riddle in his yarn 
that's clinging to the furrow of a blindman's brow 
i'll start talking from the brim of a thimble full of whiskey 
on a train through the bronx that will take you just as far 
as the empty of a bottle to the highway of a scar 
that stretched across the blacktop of my cheek like that 
and then ducks beneath the brim of a fugitive's hat 
and you'll learn why liquor makes a stool pigeon rat on every face 
that ever left his shadow down on saint marks place 
 
hell i'd double cross my mother if it was whiskey that they payed 
and so an early bird says nightsticks on the hit parade 
and he ain't got a prayer and his days are numbered 
and you'll track him down like a dog 
well it's a tough customer you're getting in this trade 
 ause the nightstick's heart pumps lemonade 
well whiskey keeps a blindman talkin alright 
and i'm the only one who knows just where he stayed last night 
 
he was in a wreckin yard in a switchblade storm 
in a wheelbarrow with nothing but revenge to keep him warm 
and a half a million dollars in unmarked bills 
was the nightstick's blanket in a febuary chill 
and as the buzzard drove a crooked sky 
he was dealin high chicago in the mud 
and stackin' the deck against a dragnet's eye 
a shivering nightstick in a miserable heap 
with the siren for a lullaby singing him to sleep 
he was bleeding from a buttonhole 
torn by a slug fired from the barrel of a two dollar gun 
that scorched a blister on the grip of a punk by now 
is learnin what you have to pay to be a hero anyhow 
 
he dressed the hole in his gut with a hundred dollar bandage 
a king's ransom for a bedspread that don't amount to nuttin 
just cobweb strings on a busted ukulele 
and the nightstick leaned on a black shillelagh 
with the poison of a junkie's broken promise on his lip 
 
he staggered in the shadows screaming i ain't never been afraid 
and he shot out every street light on the promenade 
past the frozen ham and eggers at the penny arcade 
throwin out handfuls of a blood stained salary 
they were dead in their tracks at the shootin gallery 
and they fired off a twenty one gun salute 
and from the corner of his eye he caught the alabaster orbs 
and from a dime a dance hall girl and stuffed a thousand dollar bill 
in her blouse and caught the cruel and unusual punishment of her smile 
and the nightstick winked beneath a rainsoaked brim 
ain't no one seen hide nor hair of him see 
no one but a spade on rikers island and me 
and so if you're mad enough to listen to a full of whiskey blindman 
then you're mad enough to look beyond where bloodhounds dare to go 
so if you want to know just where the nightstick's hidin out 
you be down at the ferry landin oh let's say bout half past a nightmare 
when it's twisted on a clock you tell 'em nickels sentcha 
whiskey always makes him talk 
and you ask for captain charon with the mud on his kicks 
he's the skipper of the deadline steamer 
and she sails from the bronx across the river styx 
and a riddle's just a ticket for a dreamer 
 
cause when the weathervane's sleepin and the moon turns his back 
you crawl on your belly long the railroad tracks 
and cross your heart and hope to die and stick a needle in your eye 
cause he'd cut my bleedin heart out if he found out that i squealed 
cause you see a scarecrow's just a hoodlum 
who marked the cards that he dealed 
and pulled a gypsy switch 
out on the edge of potter's field

PUTNAM COUNTY

 I guess things were always quiet around Putnam County 
kind of shy and sleepy as it clung to the skirts 
of the 2 lane, that was stretched out like an 
asphalt dance floor where all the oldtimers would 
hunker down in bib jeans and store bought boots 
lyin' about their lives and the places that they'd been 
suckin' on Coca Colas and be spittin' Days Work 
they's be suckin' on Coca Colas and be spittin' Day's Work 
until the moon was a stray dog on the ridge and 
the taverns would be swollen until the naked eye 
of 2am, and the Stratocaster guitars slung over 
Burgermeister beer guts, and the swizzle stick legs 
jacknifed over naugahyde stools and the 
witch hazel spread out over the linoleum floors, 
the pedal pushers stretched out over midriff bulge 
and the coiffed brunette curls over Maybelline eyes 
wearing Prince Machiavelli, Estee Lauder, smells so sweet 
I elbowed up at the counter with mixed feelings 
over mixed drinks 
and Bubba and the Roadmasters moaned in pool hall 
concentration as they knit their brows to 
cover the entire Hank Williams Song Book 
and the old National register was singing to the tune of $57.57 
until last call, one last game of 8 ball 
and Berneice would be putting the chairs on the tables, 
someone come in say Hey man, anyone got 
any Jumper Cables, is that a 6 or a 12 volt? 
and all the studs in town would toss 'em down 
and claim to fame as they stomped their feet 
boasting about being able to get more ass 
than a toilet seat. 
And the GMCs and the Straight 8 Fords 
were coughing and wheezing and they 
perculated as they tossed the gravel 
underneath the fenders to weave home 
a wet slick anaconda of a two lane 
with tire irons and crowbars a rattlin' 
with a tool box and a pony saddle 
you're grinding gears, shifting into first 
yea and that goddam tranny's just getting worse 
with the melodies of see ya later 
and screwdrivers on carburettors 
talkin' shop about money to loan 
and palominos and strawberry roans 
See ya tomorrow, hello to the Mrs. 
money to borrow and goodnight kisses 
the radio spittin' out Charlie Rich 
sure can sing that sonofabitch 
and you weave home, weavin' home 
leaving the little joint winking in the 
dark warm narcotic American night 
beneath a pin cushion sky and it's 
home to toast and honey, start 
up the Ford, your lunch money's there on the 
draining board, toilet's runnin' shake the 
handle, telephone's ringin' it's Mrs Randal 
where the hell are my goddam sandals 
and the porcelain poodles and the glass swans 
staring down from the knick knack shelf 
with the parent permission slips for the kids' field trips 
pair of Muckalucks scraping across 
the shag carpet 
and the impending squint of 
first light, that lurked behind 
a weeping marquee in downtown Putnam 
and would be pullin' up any minute now 
just like a bastard amber 
Velveeta yellow cab on a rainy corner 
and be blowin' its horn, in every window

RAIN DOGS

 Inside a broken clock 
Splashing the wine 
With all the Rain Dogs 
Taxi, we'd rather walk. 
Huddle a doorway with the Rain Dogs 
For i am a Rain Dog, too. 
 
Chorus 
 
Oh, how we danced and we swallowed the night 
For it was all ripe for dreamin 
Oh, how we danced away 
All of the lights 
We've always been out of our minds. 
 
The Rum pours strong and thin 
Beat out the dustman 
With the Rain Dogs 
Aboard a shipwreck train 
Give my umbrella to the Rain Dogs 
For I am a Rain Dog, too. 
 
Oh, how we danced with the 
Rose of Tralee 
Her long hair black as a raven 
Oh, how we danced and you 
Whispered to me 
You'll never be going back home, 
You'll never be going back home. 
 
Chorus

RED SHOES

 she wore red shoes by the newstand 
as the rain splashed the nickle 
spilled like chablis along the midway 
theres a little bluejay 
in a red dress, on a sad night

a compact with a cracked mirror 
and a bottle of evening in paris perfume 
whats this sad tune 
 
he told her to wait by the magazines 
he had to take care of some business it seems 
bring a raincoat 
and a suitcase 
and your dark eyes 
and wear those red shoes 
 
theres a dark huddle at the bus stop 
unbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet 
Li'l cesar got caught 
he has going down to second 
he has cooled 
changing stations on the chamber 
to steal a diamond 
from a jewelry store for his baby 
he loved the way she looked 
in those red shoes

and the dogs bayed the moon 
and rattled their chains 
and the cold jingle of taps in a puddle 
was the burgler alarm 
snitchin on cesaer 
 
note the rain washes memories from the sidewalks 
and the hounds splash down the nickle 
full of soldiers 
and santa claus is drunk in the ski room

ROCKIN' CHAIR

 Well I'm sittin' right here in my rockin chair 
Running my fingers right through my hair 
Fire is flicken with a yellow and gold 
Makin me quiver in the snowy cold 
Got a lazy old woman 
Screaming bout my money 
She took every cent 
And she didn't leave me any 
Times were never so good, got a fly for food 
Got no woman to spend my money 
Well she blew and took all my money 
So I'm sittin' right here in my rockin chair 
Running my fingers right through my hair 
Spider caught the fly in his web 
Do believe he may be dead 
Times were never so good, got a fly for food 
Got no woman to spend my money 
Well she blew and took all my money 
Well I'm sittin' and I'm sittin' and I'm sittin' right here 
In my rockin chair 
Watchin' my old dog loosing his hair

ROMEO IS BLEEDING

 romeo is bleeding but not so as you'd notice 
he's over on 18hh street as usual 
lookin' so hard against the hood of his car 
and puttin' out a cigarette in his hand 
and for all the pachucos at the pumps 
at romeros paint and body 
they all seein' how far they can spit 
well it was just another night 
but how they're huddled in the brake lights of a 58 belair 
and listenin' to how romeo killed a sherrif his knife 
 
and they all jump when they hear the sirens 
but romeo just laughs and says 
all the racket in the world ain't never gonna 
save that coppers ass 
he'll never see another summertime for gunnin' down my brother 
and leavin' him like a dog beneath a car without his knife 
 
and romeo says hey man gimme a cigarette 
and they all reach for their pack 
and frankie lights it for him and pats him on the back 
and throws bottle at a milk truck 
and as it breaks he grabs his nuts 
and they all know they could be just like romeo 
if they only had the guts 
 
but romeo is bleeding but nobody can tell 
and he sings along with the radio 
with a bullet in his chest 
and he combs back his fenders 
and they all agree its clear 
that every thing is cool now that romeos here 
but romeo is bleeding 
and he winces now and then and he leans against 
the car doors and feels the blood in his shoes 
and someones crying in the phone booth 
at the 5 points by thestore 
romeo starts his engine 
and wipes the blood off the door 
and he brodys through the signal 
with the radio full blast 
leavin' the boys there hikin' up there chinos 
and they all try to stand like romeo 
beneath the moon cut like a sickle 
and they're talkin' now in spanish about there hero 
 
but romeo is bleeding as he gives the man his ticket 
and he climbs to the balcony at the movies 
and he'll die without a wimper 
like every heros dream 
just an angel with a bullet 
and cagney on the screen

ROSIE

 Well I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn 
Nobody's up except the moon and me, 
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree 
All that you left me was a melody. 
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie... 
 
And the moon's all up, full and big, apricot tips in an indigo sky, 
And I've been loving you, Rosie, since the day I was born 
And I'll love you, Rosie 'til the day I die. 
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie... 
 
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie... 
 
And I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn 
Nobody's up except the moon and me, 
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree 
All that you left me was a melody. 
Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie...

RUBY'S ARMS

 i will leave behind all of my clothes, i wore when i was with you, all i 
need's my railroad boots, and my leather jacket, as i say goodbye to ruby's 
arms, although my heart is breaking, i will steal away out through your 
blinds, for soon you will be waking. 
 
the morning light has washed your face, and everything is turning blue now, 
hold on to your pillow case there's nothing i can do now, as i say goodbye to 
ruby's arms, you'll find another soldier, and i swear to god by christmas, 
there'll be someone else to hold you. 
 
the only thing i'm taking is the scarf off of your clothesline, i'll hurry 
past your chest of drawers, and your broken window chimes, as i say goodbye 
i'll say goodbye, say goodbye to ruby's arms. 
 
i'll feel my way down the darken hall, and out into the morning, the hobos 
at the freightyards, have kept their fires burning, so jesus christ this 
goddamn rain, will someone put me on a train, i'll never kiss your lips again, 
or break your heart, as i say goodbye i'll say goodbye, say goodbye to ruby's 
arms.

SAN DIEGO SERENADE

 I never saw the morning 'til I stayed up all night 
I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out the light 
I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long 
I never heard the melody, until I needed a song. 
 
I never saw the white line, 'til I was leaving you behind 
I never knew I needed you 'til I was caught up in a bind 
I never spoke 'I love you' 'til I cursed you in vain, 
I never felt my heartstrings until I nearly went insane. 
 
I never saw the east coast 'til I move to the west 
I never saw the moonlight until it shone off your breast 
I never saw your heart 'til someone tried to steal, tried to steal it away 
I never saw your tears until they rolled down your face.

SAVING ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU

 it's too early for the circus, it's too late for the bars, no one's sleepin' 
but the paperboys, and no one in this town is makin' any noise, but the dogs 
and the milkmen and me. 
 
the girls around here all look like cadillacs, no one likes a stranger here, 
i'd come home but i'm afraid that you won't take me back, but i'd trade off 
everything just to have you near. 
 
i know i'm irresponsible and i don't behave, and i ruin everything that i 
do, and i'll probably get arrested when i'm in my grave, but i'll be savin' 
all my love for you. 
 
i paid fifteen dollars for a prostitute, with too much makeup and a broken 
shoe, but her eyes were just a counterfeit, she tried to gyp me out of it, but 
you know that i'm still in love you. 
 
don't listen to the rumors that you hear about me, cause i ain't as bad as 
they make me out to be, well i may lose my mind but baby can't you see, that 
i'll be savin' all my love for you.

SEMI SUITE

 Well you hate those diesels rollin' 
And those Friday nights out bowlin' 
When he's off for a twelve hour lay over night 
 
You wish you had a dollar 
For every time he hollered 
That he's leavin' 
And he's never comin' back 
 
But the curtain laced billow 
And his hands on your pillow 
And his trousers are hangin' on the chair 
 
You're lyin' through your pain, babe 
But you're gonna tell him he's your man 
And you ain't got the courage to leave 
 
He tells you that you're on his mind 
You're the only one he's ever gonna find 
It's kind a special, understands his complicated soul... 
 
But the only place a man can breathe 
And collect his thoughts is 
Midnight and flyin' away on the road. 
 
But you've packed and unpacked 
So many times you've lost track 
And the steam heat is drippin' off the walls 
 
But when you hear his engines 
You're lookin' through the window in the kitchen and you know 
You're always gonna be there when he calls 
 
'Cause he's a truck drivin' man 
Stoppin' when he can 
He's a truck drivin' man 
Stoppin' when he can

SHIVER ME TIMBERS

 I'm leavin' my fam'ly 
Leavin' all my friends 
My body's at home 
But my heart's in the wind 
Where the clouds are like headlines 
On a new front page sky 
My tears are salt water 
And the moon's full and high 
 
And I know Martin Eden's 
Gonna be proud of me 
And many before me 
Who've been called by the sea 
To be up in the crow's nest 
Singin' my say 
Shiver me Timbers 
'Cause I'm a sailin' away 
 
And the fog's liftin' 
And the sand's shiftin' 
I'm driftin' on out 
Ol' Captain Ahab 
He ain't got nothin' on me, now. 
So swallow me, don't follow me 
I'm trav'lin' alone 
Blue water's my daughter 
'n I'm gonna skip like a stone 
 
So please call my missus 
Gotta tell her not to cry 
'Cause my goodbye is written 
By the moon in the sky 
Hey and nobody knows me 
I can't fathom my stayin' 
Shiver me timbers

SHORE LEAVE

 Well with buck shot eyes and a purple heart 
I rolled down the national stroll 
and with a big fat paycheck 
strapped to my hip sack 
and a shore leave wristwatch underneath 
my sleeve 
in a Hong Kong drizzle on Cuban heels 
I rowed down the gutter to the Blood Bank 
and I'd left all my papers on the Ticonderoga 
and was in a bad need of a shave 
and so I slopped at the corner on cold chow mein 
and shot billards with a midget 
until the rain stopped 
and I bought a long sleeved shirt 
with horses on the front 
and some gum and a lighter and a knife 
and a new deck of cards (with girls on the back) 
and I sat down and wrote a letter to my wife 
 
and I said Baby, I'm so far away from home 
and I miss my Baby so 
I can't make it by myself 
I love you so 
 
Well I was pacing myself 
trying to make it all last 
squeezing all the life 
out of a lousy two day pass 
and I had a cold one at the Dragon 
with some Filipino floor show 
and talked baseball with a lieutenant 
over a Singapore sling 
and I wondered how the same moon outside 
over this Chinatown fair 
could look down on Illinois 
and find you there 
and you know I love you Baby 
 
and I'm so far away from home 
and I miss my Baby so 
I can't make it by myself 
I love you so

SINGAPORE

 We sail tonight for Singapore 
We're all as mad as hatters here 
I've fallen for tawny moor 
Took off to the land of Nod 
Drank with all the Chinamen 
Walked the sewers of Paris 
I danced along a colored wind 
Dangled from a rope of sand 
You must say goodbye to me 
 
We sail tonight for Singapore 
Don't fall asleep while you're ashore 
Cross your heart and hope to die 
When you hear the children cry. 
Let marrow bone and cleaver choose 
While making feet for children shoes 
Through the alley 
Back from Hell 
When you hear that steeple bell 
You must say goodbye to me. 
 
Wipe him down with gasoline 
Till his arms are hard and mean, 
From now on boys this iron boat's your home 
So heave away boys. 
 
We sail tonight for Singapore 
Take your blankets from the floor 
Wash your mouth out by the door 
The whole town is made of iron ore 
Every witness turns to steam 
They all become Italian dreams 
Fill your pockets up with earth 
Get yourself a dollar's worth 
Away boys, away, boys, heave away 
 
The captain is a one armed dwarf 
He's throwing dice along the wharf 
In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is King 
So take this ring 
 
Repeat First Verse

SMALL CHANGE (GOT RAINED ON WITH HIS OWN .38)

 Small Change got rained on with his own thirty eight, 
And nobody flinched down by the arcade 
And the marquees weren't weeping, they went stark raving mad, 
And the cabbies were the only ones that really had it made 
And his cold trousers were twisted, and the sirens high and shrill, 
And crumpled in his fist was a five dollar bill 
And the naked mannequins with their Cheshire grins, 
And the raconteurs and roustabouts said Buddy, come on in, 'cause 
'Cause the dreams ain't broken down here now, they're walking with a limp 
Now that Small Change got rained on with his own thirty eight 
 
And nobody flinched down by the arcade 
And the burglar alarm's been disconnected, 
And the newsmen start to rattle 
And the cops are telling jokes about some whorehouse in Seattle 
And the fire hydrants plead the Fifth Amendment 
And the furniture is bargains galore 
But the blood is by the jukebox on an old linoleum floor 
And what a hot rain on Forty Second Street, 
And now the umbrellas ain't got a chance 
And the newsboy's a lunatic with stains on his pants, 'cause 
'Cause Small Change got rained on with his own thirty eight 
 
And no one's gone over to close his eyes 
And there's a racing form in his pocket, 
Circled Blue Boots in the third 
And the cashier at the clothing store didn't say a word 
As the siren tears the night in half, and someone lost his wallet 
Well, a surveillance of assailance, it that's what you want to call it 
And the whores hike up their skirts and fish for drug store prophylactics 
With their mouths cut just like razor blades and their eyes are like stilettos 
And her radiator's steaming and her teeth are in a wreck, and nah, 
She won't let you kiss her, but what the hell do you expect? 
And the Gypsies are tragic and if you want to buy perfume, 
Well, they'll bark you down like carneys, sell you Christmas cards in June, but 
But Small Change got rained on with his own thirty eight 
 
And his headstone's a gumball machine, 
No more chewing gum or baseball cards or overcoats or dreams 
Someone's hosing down the sidewalk, and he's only in his teens, 'cause 
'Cause Small Change got rained on with his own thirty eight 
 
And a fistful of dollars can't change that, 
And someone copped his watch fob, and someone got his ring 
And the newsboy got his porkpie Stetson hat 
And the tuberculosis old men at the Nelson wheeze and cough 
And someone will head south until this whole thing cools off, 'cause 
'Cause Small Change got rained on with his own thirty eight, yeah, 
Small Change got rained on with his own thirty eight

SOLDIER'S THINGS

 Davenports and kettle drums 
and swallow tail coats 
table cloths and patent leather shoes 
bathing suits and bowling balls 
and clarinets and rings 
and all this radio really 
needs is a fuse 
a tinker, a tailor 
a soldier's things 
his rifle, his boots full of rocks 
and this one is for bravery 
and this one is for me 
and everything's a dollar 
in this box 
 
Cuff links and hub caps 
trophies and paperbacks 
it's good transportation 
but the brakes aren't so hot 
neck tie and boxing gloves 
this jackknife is rusted 
you can pound that dent out 
on the hood 
a tinker, a tailor 
a soldier's things 
his rifle, his boots full of rocks 
oh and this one is for bravery 
and this one is for me 
and everything's a dollar 
in this box

SPARE PARTS I (A NOCTURNAL EMISSION)

 (Tom Waits and Chuck E. Weiss) 
 
well the damn cracked hard just like a bull whip 
cause it wasn't takin' no lip from the night before 
as it shook out the street, the stew bums showed up 
just like bounced checks, rubbin' their necks 
and the sky turned the color of Pepto Bismol 
and the parking lots growled 
and my old sports coat full of promissory notes 
and a receipt from a late night motel 
and the hawk had his whole family out 
there in the wind, and he's got a message 
for you to beware cause he be kickin' your 
ass in, in a cold blooded fashion 
dishin' out more than a good man can bear 
I got shoes untied, shirt tail's out, ain't got a 
ghost of a chance with this old romance 
just an apartment for rent down the block 
Ivar Theater with live burlesque 
and the manager's scowlin', feet on his desk 
boom boom against the curtain 
you're still hurtin' 
and then push came to shove, shove came to biff 
girls like that just lay you out stiff 
maybe I'll go to Cleveland or 
get me a tattoo or somethin', my brother 
in law's there 
skid mark tattoo on the asphalt blue 
was that a Malibu 
Liz Taylor and Montgomery Clift 
cumming on to the broads with the 
same ol' riff. Hey baby come up to 
my place, we'll listen to some 
smooth music on the stereo, no thank you 
got any Stan Getz records 
no I got Smothers Brothers 
so I combed back my Detroit 
jack up my pegs, wiped my Stacy Adams 
jacknifed my legs, yea I got designs 
on a moving violation 
hey baby, you put me on hold and I'm 
out in the wind and it's getting 
mighty cold... 
colder than a gut shot bitch wolf dog 
with 9 sucking pups pullin' a 4 trap 
up a hill in the dead of winter 
in the middle of a snowstorm 
with a mouth full of porcupine quills 
 
(scat) 
 
yea well I don't need you baby 
It's a well known fact 
I'm 4 sheets to the wind 
I'm glad you're gone 
I'm glad you're gone 
I'm finally alone 
glad you're gone, but I 
wish you'd come home 
and I struggled out of bed 
cause the dawn was crackin' hard like a bullwhip 
cause it wasn't takin' no lip from the night before 
as it shook out the streets the stew bums 
showed up just like bounced checks 
rubbin' their necks, and the sky turned the 
color of Pepto Bismol 
and my old sports coat full of promissory notes 
and the hawk had his whole family out there 
in the wind, he got a message for you to beware 
kickin' your ass in, in a cold blooded fashion 
he be dishin' out more than a good man can bear 
well hey baby let's take it to Bakersfield 
get a little apartment somewhere

STEP RIGHT UP

 Step right up, step right up, step right up, 
Everyone's a winner, bargains galore 
That's right, you too can be the proud owner 
Of the quality goes in before the name goes on 
One tenth of a dollar, one tenth of a dollar, we got service after sales 
You need perfume? we got perfume, how 'bout an engagement ring? 
Something for the little lady, something for the little lady, 
Something for the little lady, hmm 
Three for a dollar 
We got a year end clearance, we got a white sale 
And a smoke damaged furniture, you can drive it away today 
Act now, act now, and receive as our gift, our gift to you 
They come in all colors, one size fits all 
No muss, no fuss, no spills, you're tired of kitchen drudgery 
Everything must go, going out of business, going out of business 
Going out of business sale 
Fifty percent off original retail price, skip the middle man 
Don't settle for less 
How do we do it? how do we do it? volume, volume, turn up the volume 
Now you've heard it advertised, don't hesitate 
Don't be caught with your drawers down, 
Don't be caught with your drawers down 
You can step right up, step right up 
 
That's right, it filets, it chops, it dices, slices, 
Never stops, lasts a lifetime, mows your lawn 
And it mows your lawn and it picks up the kids from school 
It gets rid of unwanted facial hair, it gets rid of embarrassing age spots, 
It delivers a pizza, and it lengthens, and it strengthens 
And it finds that slipper that's been at large 
under the chaise lounge for several weeks 
And it plays a mean Rhythm Master, 
It makes excuses for unwanted lipstick on your collar 
And it's only a dollar, step right up, it's only a dollar, step right up 
 
'Cause it forges your signature 
If not completely satisfied, mail back unused portion of product 
For complete refund of price of purchase 
Step right up 
Please allow thirty days for delivery, don't be fooled by cheap imitations 
You can live in it, live in it, laugh in it, love in it 
Swim in it, sleep in it, 
Live in it, swim in it, laugh in it, love in it 
Removes embarrassing stains from contour sheets, that's right 
And it entertains visiting relatives, it turns a sandwich into a banquet 
Tired of being the life of the party? 
Change your shorts, change your life, change your life 
Change into a nine year old Hindu boy, get rid of your wife, 
And it walks your dog, and it doubles on sax 
Doubles on sax, you can jump back Jack, see you later alligator 
See you later alligator 
And it steals your car 
It gets rid of your gambling debts, it quits smoking 
It's a friend, and it's a companion, 
And it's the only product you will ever need 
Follow these easy assembly instructions it never needs ironing 
Well it takes weights off hips, bust, thighs, chin, midriff, 
Gives you dandruff, and it finds you a job, it is a job 
And it strips the phone company free take ten for five exchange, 
And it gives you denture breath 
And you know it's a friend, and it's a companion 
And it gets rid of your traveler's checks 
It's new, it's improved, it's old fashioned 
Well it takes care of business, never needs winding, 
Never needs winding, never needs winding 
Gets rid of blackheads, the heartbreak of psoriasis, 
Christ, you don't know the meaning of heartbreak, buddy, 
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
'Cause it's effective, it's defective, it creates household odors, 
It disinfects, it sanitizes for your protection 
It gives you an erection, it wins the election 
Why put up with painful corns any longer? 
It's a redeemable coupon, no obligation, no salesman will visit your home 
We got a jackpot, jackpot, jackpot, prizes, prizes, prizes, all work guaranteed 
How do we do it, how do we do it, how do we do it, how do we do it 
We need your business, we're going out of business 
We'll give you the business 
Get on the business end of our going out of business sale 
Receive our free brochure, free brochure 
Read the easy to follow assembly instructions, batteries not included 
Send before midnight tomorrow, terms available, 
Step right up, step right up, step right up 
You got it buddy: the large print giveth, and the small print taketh away 
Step right up, you can step right up, you can step right up 
C'mon step right up 
(Get away from me kid, you bother me...) 
Step right up, step right up, step right up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
Step right up, you can step right up, c'mon and step right up, 
C'mon and step right up

SUCH A SCREAM

 Well Pale Face said 
To the Eyeball Kid 
She just goes clank and boom and steam 
A halo, wings, horns and a tail 
Shoveling coal inside my dreams 
There are no laws 
She's made of cream 
She's such a scream 
 
Qui bon tres bien, nails in cement 
A Donnie gal from mortal clay 
The plow is red 
THe well is full inside 
The dollhouse of her skull 
A cheetah coat fills up with steam 
She's such a scream 
 
All crooked lines 
Her fireplace 
A milktrain so clean 
Machine gun haste 
You'll ride the only wall of shame 
And drag that chain across the state 
Her lips are red 
She is the queen 
She's such a scream

 

TOM WAITS
SWORDFISHTROMBONES

 Well he came home from the war 
with a party in his head 
and modified Brougham DeVille 
and a pair of legs that opened up 
like butterfly wings 
and a mad dog that wouldn't 
sit still 
he went and took up with a Salvation Army 
Band girl 
who played dirty water 
on a swordfishtrombone 
he went to sleep at the bottom of 
Tenkiller lake 
and he said gee, but it's 
great to be home. 
 
Well he came home from the war 
with a party in his head 
and an idea for a fireworks display 
and he knew that he'd be ready with 
a stainless steel machete 
and a half a pint of Ballentine's 
each day 
and he holed up in room above a hardware store 
cryin' nothing there but Hollywood tears 
and he put a spell on some 
poor little Crutchfield girl 
and stayed like that for 27 years 
 
Well he packed up all his 
expectations he lit out for California 
with a flyswatter banjo on his knee 
with a lucky tiger in his angel hair 
and benzedrine for getting there 
they found him in a eucalyptus tree 
lieutenant got him a canary bird 
and shaked her head with every word 
and Chesterfielded moonbeams in a song 
and he got 20 years for lovin' her 
from some Oklahoma governor 
said everything this Doughboy 
does is wrong 
 
Now some say he's doing 
the obituary mambo 
and some say he's hanging on the wall 
perhaps this yarn's the only thing 
that holds this man together 
some say he was never here at all 
 
Some say they saw him down in 
Birmingham, sleeping in a 
boxcar going by 
and if you think that you can tell a bigger tale 
I swear to God you'd have to tell a lie...

 

TOM WAITS
TAKE IT WITH ME

 Phone's off the hook 
No one knows where we are 
It's a long time since I 
Drank champagne 
The ocean is blue 
As blue as your eyes 
I'm gonna take it with me 
When I go 
 
Old long since gone 
Now way back when 
We lived in Coney Island 
Ain't no good thing 
Ever dies 
I'm gonna take it with me 
When I go 
 
Far far away a train 
Whistle blows 
Wherever you're goin 
Wherever you've been 
Waving good bye at the end 
Of the day 
You're up and you're over 
And you're far away 
 
Always for you, and 
Forever yours 
It felt just like the old days 
We fell asleep on Beaula's porch 
I'm gonna take it with me 
When I go 
 
All broken down by 
The side of the road 
I was never more alive or 
Alone 
I've worn the faces off 
All the cards 
I'm gonna take it with me 
When I go 
 
Children are playing 
At the end of the day 
Strangers are singing 
On our lawn 
It's got to be more 
Than flesh and bone 
All that you're loved 
Is all you own 
 
In a land there's a town 
And in that town there's 
A house 
And in that house 
There's a woman 
And in that woman 
There's a hart I love 
I'm gonna take it 
With me when I go 
I'm gonna take it 
With me when I go

 

TOM WAITS
TANGO TILL THEY'RE SORE

 Well ya play that Tarantella 
All the hounds they start to roar 
And the boys all go to hell 
Then the Cubans hit the floor 
And they drive along the pipeline 
They tango till they're sore 
They take apart their nightmares 
And they leave them by the door. 
Chorus: 
Let me fall out the window 
With confetti in my hair 
Deal out jacks or better 
On a blanket by the stairs 
I'll tell you all my secrets 
But I lie about my past 
So send me off to bed forever more. 
 
Make sure they play my theme song 
I guess daisies will have to do 
Just get me to New Orleans 
And paint shadows on the pews 
Turn the spit on that pig 
Kick the drum and let me down 
Put my clarinet beneath your bed 
Till I get back in town. 
Chorus 
 
Just sure she's all in calico 
And the color of a doll 
Wave the flag on cadillac day 
And a skillet on the wall 
Cut me a switch or hold you breath 
Till the sun goes down 
Write my name on the hood 
Send me off to another town. 
 
Chorus

TELEPHONE CALL FROM ISTANBUL

 All night long on the broken glass 
livin in a medicine chest 
mediteromanian hotel back 
sprawled across a roll top desk 
the monkey rode the blade on an 
overhead fan 
they paint the donkey blue if you pay 
I got a telephone call from Istanbul 
my baby's coming home today 
will you sell me one of those if I shave my head 
get me out of town is what fireball said 
never trust a man in a blue trench coat 
never drive a car when you're dead 
Saturday's a festival 
Friday's a gem 
dye your hair yellow 
and raise your hem 
follow me to beulah's on 
dry creek road 
I got to wear the hat that my baby done sewed 
take me down to buy a tux 
on red rose bear 
got to cut a hole in the day 
I got a telephone call from Istanbul 
my baby's coming home today

TEMPTATION

 Rusted brandy in a diamond glass 
everything is made from dreams 
time is made from honey slow and sweet 
only the fools know what it means 
temptation, temptation, temptation 
oh, temptation, temptation, I can't resist 
I know that she is made of smoke 
but I've lost my wayy 
she knows that I am broke 
so that I must play 
temptation, temptation, temptation 
oh, whoa, temptation, temptation, I can't resist 
Dutch pink and Italian blue 
she is waiting there for you 
my will has disappeared 
now my confusions oh so clear 
temptation, temptation, temptation 
whoa, whoa, temptation, temptation 
I can't reisist

THAT FEEL

 (Keith Richards/Tom Waits) 
 
Well there's one thing you can't lose 
It's that feel 
Your pants, your shirt, your shoes 
But not that feel 
You can throw it out in the rain 
You can whip it like a dog 
You can chop it down like an old dead tree 
You can always see it 
When you're coming into town 
Once you hang it on the wall 
You can never take it down 
 
But there's one thing you can't lose 
ANd it's that feel 
You can pawn your watch and chain 
But not that feel 
It always comes and finds you 
It will always hear yo ucry 
I cross my wooden leg 
And I swear on my glass eye 
Itt will never leave you high and dry 
Never leave you loose 
It's harder to get rid of than tattoos 
 
But there's one thing you can't do 
Is lose that feel 
You can throw it off a bridge 
You can lose it in the fire 
Yo ucan leave it at the altar 
But it will make you out a liar 
You can fall down in the street 
You can leaveit in the lurch 
Well you say that it's gospel 
But I know that it's only church 
 
And there's one thing you can't lose 
And it's that feel 
It's that feel

THAT'S THE WAY

 (Tom Waits/William Burroughs) 
 
That's the way the stomach rumbles 
That's the way the bee bumbles 
That's the way the needle pricks 
That's the way the glue sticks 
That's the way the potato mashes 
That's the way the pan flashes 
That's the way the market crashes 
That's the way the whip lashes 
That's the way the teeth knashes 
That's the way the gravy stains 
That's the way the moon wanes

THE BRIAR AND THE ROSE

 I fell asleep down by the stream 
And there I had the strangest dream 
And down by Brennan's Glenn there grows 
A briar and a rose 
 
There's a tree in the forest 
But I don't know where 
I built a nest out of your hair 
And climbing up into the air 
A briar and a rose 
 
I don't know how long it has been 
But I was born in Brennan's Glenn 
And near the end of spring there grows 
A briar and a rose 
 
P icked the rose one early morn 
I pricked my finger on a thorn 
It had grown so high 
It's winding wove the briar around the rose 
 
I tried to tear them both apart 
I felt a bullet in my heart 
And all dressed up in springs and clothes 
The briar and the rose 
 
And when I'm buried in my grave 
Tell me so I will know 
Your tears will fall 
To make love grow 
The briar and the rose

THE GHOSTS OF SATURDAY NIGHT (AFTER HOURS AT NAPOLEONE'S PIZZA HOUSE)

 A cab combs the snake, 
Tryin' to rake in that last night's fare, 
And a solitary sailor 
Who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers... 
 
Paws his inside P coat pocket for a welcome twenty five cents, 
And the last bent butt from a package of Kents, 
As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes 
And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair. 
 
Her rhinestone studded moniker says, Irene 
As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes 
And the Texaco beacon burns on, 
The steel belted attendant with a 'Ring and Valve Special'... 
Cryin' Fill'er up and check that oil 
 You know it could be a distributor and it could be a coil. 
 
The early mornin' final edition's on the stands, 
And that town cryer's cryin' there with nickels in his hands. 
Pigs in a blanket sixty nine cents, 
Eggs roll 'em over and a package of Kents, 
Adam and Eve on a log, you can sink 'em damn straight, 
Hash browns, hash browns, you know I can't be late. 
 
And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamond 
Across a cash crop car lot filled with twilight Coupe Devilles, 
Leaving the town in a keeping 
Of the one who is sweeping 
Up the ghost of Saturday night...

 

TOM WAITS
THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER

 I love the way 
The tattered clouds 
Go wind across the sky 
 
As summer goes 
And leave me 
With a tear in my eye 
 
I'm taking out my winter clothes 
My garden knows what's wrong 
The petals of my favorite rose 
Be in the shadows dark and long 
 
Through every year 
It's very clear 
I should be used 
To carrying on 
But I can't be found 
IN the garden 
Singing this song 
 
When the last 
Rose of summer is gone

 

TOM WAITS
THE OCEAN DOESN'T WANT ME

 The ocean doesn't want me today 
But I'll be back tomorrow to play 
And the stranglers will take me 
Down deep in their brine 
The mischievous braingels 
Down into the endless blue wine 
I'll open my head and let out 
All of my time 
I'd love to go drowning 
And to stay and to stay 
But the ocean doesn't want me today 
I'll go in up to here 
It can't possibly hurt 
All they will find is my beer 
And my shirt 
A rip tide is raging 
And the life guard is away 
But the ocean doesn't want me today 
The ocean doesn't want me today

 

TOM WAITS
THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY

 Well this gigolo's jumping salty, ain't no trade out on the streets, 
Half past the unlucky, and the hawk's a front row seat 
Dressed in full orchestration, stage door Johnny's got to pay, 
And sent him home talking 'bout the one that got away 
 
Could have been on Easy Street, could have been a wheel, 
With irons in the fire and all them business deals 
But the last of the big time losers shouted before he drove away, 
 I'll be right back, as soon as I crack the one that got away 
 
Well, the ambulance drivers, they don't give a shit, 
They just want to get off work, and 
The short stop and the victim are already gone berserk 
And the shroud tailor measures him for a deep six holiday, 
The stiff is froze, the case is closed on the one that got away 
 
Now Jim Crow's directing traffic with them cemetery blues, 
With them peculiar looking trousers, them old Italian shoes 
And a wooden kimono that was all ready to drop in San Francisco Bay 
But he's mumbling something all about the one that got away 
 
And Costello was the champion at the St. Moritz Hotel, 
And the best this side of Fairfax, reliable sources tell 
But his reputation is at large, and he's at Ben Frank's every day, 
Waiting for the one that got away 
 
He got a snakeskin sportshirt, and he looks like Vincent Price, 
With a little piece of chicken, and he's carving off a slice 
Someone tipped her off, and she'll be doing a Houdini now any day 
She shook his hustle, and a Greyhound bus'll take the one that got away 
 
Well, Andre's at the piano behind the Ivar in the sewers, 
With a buck a shot for pop tunes, and a fin for guided tours 
He could a been in Casa Blanca , he stood in line out there all day 
Now he's spilling whiskey and learning songs about a one that got away 
 
Well I've lost my equilibrium and my car keys and my pride, 
The tattoo parlor's warm, and so I hustle there inside 
And the grinding off the buzz saw, What you want that thing to say? 
I says, Just don't misspell her name, buddy, she's the one that got away

THE PIANO HAS BEEN DRINKING (NOT ME)

 The piano has been drinking, my necktie is asleep 
And the combo went back to New York, the jukebox has to take a leak 
And the carpet needs a haircut, and the spotlight looks like a prison break 
And the telephone's out of cigarettes, and the balcony is on the make 
And the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinking... 
 
And the menus are all freezing, and the light man's blind in one eye 
And he can't see out of the other 
And the piano tuner's got a hearing aid, and he showed up with his mother 
And the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinking 
As the bouncer is a Sumo wrestler cream puff casper milktoast 
And the owner is a mental midget with the I.Q. of a fence post 
'Cause the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinking... 
 
And you can't find your waitress with a Geiger counter 
And she hates you and your friends and you just can't get served without her 
And the box office is drooling, and the bar stools are on fire 
And the newspapers were fooling, and the ash trays have retired 
'Cause the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinking 
The piano has been drinking, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me

TIME

 Well, the smart money's on Harlow 
And the moon is in the street 
The shadow boys are breaking all the laws 
And you're east of East St. Louis 
And the wind is making speeches 
And the rain sounds like a round of applause 
Napoleon is weeping in the Carnival saloon 
His invisible fianc is in the mirror 
The band is going home 
It's raining hammers, it's raining nails 
Yes, it's true, there's nothing left for him down here 
 
Chorus: 
And it's Time Time Time 
And it's Time Time Time 
And it's Time Time Time 
That you love 
And it's Time Time Time 
 
And they all pretend they're Orphans 
And their memory's like a train 
You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away 
And the things you can't remember 
Tell the things you can't forget that 
History puts a saint in every dream 
Well she said she'd steak around 
Until the bandages came off 
But these mamas boys just don't know when to quit 
And Matida asks the sailors are those dreams 
Or are those prayers 
So just close your eyes, son 
And this won't hurt a bit 
 
Chorus 
 
Well, things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl 
The boys just dive right off the cars 
And splash into the street 
And when she's on a roll she pulls a razor 
From her boot and a thousand 
Pigeons fall around her feet 
So put a candle in the window 
And a kiss upon his lips 
Till the dish outside the window fills with rain 
Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart 
And play the fiddler off till i come back again 
 
Chorus

TOM TRAUBERT'S BLUES

 Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did, I've got what I paid for now 
See you tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow a couple of bucks from you 
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, 
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me 
 
I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley 
And I'm tired of all these soldiers here 
No one speaks English, and everything's broken, and my Stacys are soaking wet 
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, 
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me 
 
Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking 
A lot they can do for me 
I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open, 
And I'm down on my knees tonight 
Old Bushmill's I staggered, you'd bury the dagger 
In your silhouette window light go 
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, 
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me 
 
Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her 
And the one armed bandit knows 
And the maverick Chinamen, and the cold blooded signs, 
And the girls down by the strip tease shows, go 
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, 
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me 
 
No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say 
That the streets aren't for dreaming now 
And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories, 
They want a piece of the action anyhow 
Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, 
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me 
 
And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor, 
And the old men in wheelchairs know 
And Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred, 
And she follows wherever you may go 
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda, 
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me 
 
And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace, 
And a wound that will never heal 
No prima donna, the perfume is on an 
Old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey 
And goodnight to the street sweepers, the night watchmen flame keepers 
And goodnight to Mathilda, too

TOWN WITH NO CHEER

 Well it's hotter 'n blazes and all the long faces 
there'll be no oasis for a dry local grazier 
there'll be no refreshment for a thirsty jackaroo 
from Melbourne to Adelaide on the overlander 
with newfangled buffet cars and faster locomotives 
the train stopped in Serviceton less and less often 
There's nothing sadder than a town with no cheer 
Voc Rail decided the canteen was no longer necessary there 
no spirits, no bilgewater and 80 dry locals 
and the high noon sun beats a hundred and four 
there's a hummingbird trapped in a closed down shoe store 
 
This tiny Victorian rhubarb 
kept the watering hole open for sixty five years 
now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21 st 
wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse 
the train smokes down the xylophone 
there'll be no stopping here 
all ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer 
no Bourbon, no Branchwater 
though the townspeople here 
fought her Vic Rail decree tooth and nail 
now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21 st 
wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse 
the train smokes down the xylophone 
there'll be no stopping here 
all ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer

TRAIN SONG

 Well I broke down in E. St. Louis 
On the Kansas City line 
and I drunk up all my money 
that I borrowed every time 
and I fell down at the derby 
and now the night's black as a crow 
It was a train that took me away from here 
but a train can't bring me home 
What made my dreams so hollow 
was standing at the depot 
with a steeple full of swallows 
that could never ring the bell 
and I come ten thousand miles away 
with not one thing to show 
well it was a train that took me away from here 
but a train can't bring me home 
I remember when I left 
without bothering to pack 
you know I up and left with 
just the clothes I had on my back 
now I'm sorry for what I've done 
and I'm out here on my own 
well it was a train that took me away from 
here but a train can't bring me home

TROUBLE'S BRAIDS

 Well I pulled on trouble's braids 
and I hid in the briars 
out by the quick mud 
stayin' away from the main roads 
passin' out wolf tickets 
downwind from the blood hounds 
and I pulled on trouble's braids 
and I lay by a cypress 
as quiet as a stone 
'til the bleeding stopped 
I blew the weather vane 
off some old road house 
I build a fire in the 
skeleton back seat of an old Tucker 
and I pulled on trouble's braids 
I spanked cold red mud 
where the hornet stung deep 
and I tossed in the ditch 
in a restless sleep 
and I pulled on trouble's braids 
I hung my rain soaked jacket 
on some old barbed wire 
poured cold rusty water 
on a miserable fire 
I pulled on trouble's braids 
the creek was swollen by daybreak and I could just 
barely see 
and I floated downstream 
on an old dead tree 
and I pulled on trouble's braids 
I pulled on trouble's braids 
I pulled on trouble's braids 
I pulled on trouble's braids

they're alive, they're awake 
while the rest of the world is asleep 
below the mine shaft roads 
it will all unfold 
there's a world going on

they are marching around

all the trucks unload 
beyond the gopher holes 
there's a world going on

UNION SQUARE

 Well time is always money 
For the boys at Union Square 
You can bust your ass till doomsday 
But don't forget to say your prayers 
Someone's got a wad on the backstreet. 
Sacco got a bran' new slack 
And your baby is handcuffed on the front seat 
You just sit right there, boy and relax 
 
Chorus: 
I'm goin' down down down 
I'm goin' down down down 
I'm goin' down down down 
I'm goin' down down down 
 
Well they spill out of the Cinema 14 
To that drag bar there on the block 
Best live show by far in the whole east coast 
With a bank rolled up in your sock 
She stand right there for your pleasure 
Half Puerto Rican Chinese 
Your got to find your baby somebody to measure 
I'm goin' to get me some of these baby. 
Chorus 
 
Four in the mornin' on a Sunday 
Sacco drinkin' whiskey in church 
Half pint festival brandy 
That 'bout to fall right off his perch 
The guy in the sweaters off duty 
Out in front on the welfare hotel 
The guy in the dress is a beauty 
Go all the way and I swear you never can tell

VIRGINIA AVENUE

 Well, I'm walking on down Virginia Avenue 
Trying to find somebody to tell my troubles to. 
Harold's club is closing, and everybody's going on home: 
What's a poor boy to do? 
 
I'll just get on back into my short, make it back to the fort 
Sleep off all the crazy lizards inside of my brain. 
There's got to be some place that's better than this 
This life I'm leading's driving me insane 
 
And let me tell you I'm dreaming... 
 
Let me tell you that I'm dreaming to the twilight, this town has got me down. 
I've seen all the highlights, I've been walking all around 
I won't make a fuss, I'll take a Greyhound bus, carry me away from here: 
Tell me, what have I got to lose? 
 
'Cause I'm walking on down Columbus Avenue 
The bars are all closing, 'cause it's quarter to two 
Every town I go to is like a lock without a key 
Those I leave behind are catching up on me, 
Let me tell you they're catching up on me, they're catching up on me 
Catching up on me, catching up on me, catching up on me.

WALKING SPANISH

 He's got himself a homemade special 
You know his glass is full of sand 
And it feels just like a jaybird 
The way it fits into his hand 
He rolled a blade up in his trick towel 
They slap their hands against the wall 
You never trip, you never stumble 
He's walking spanish down the hall 
 
Slim him a picture of our Jesus 
Or give him a spoon to dig a hole 
What all he done ain't no one's business 
But he'll need blankets for the cold 
They dim the lights over on Broadway 
Even the king has bowed his head 
Every face looks right up at Mason 
He's walking spanish down the hall 
 
Latella's screeching for a blind pig 
Punk Sander's carved it out of wood 
He never sang when he got hoodwinked 
They tried it all but he never would 
Tomorrow morning there'll be laundry 
But he'll be somewhere else to hear the call 
Don't say goodbye he's just leaving early 
He's walking spanish down the hall 
 
All St. Barthelemew said was whispered 
Into the ear of Blind Jack Dawes 
All Baker told the machine 
Was that he never broke the law 
Go on and tip your hat up to the Pilate 
Take off your watch, your rings and all 
Even Jesus wanted just a little more time 
He's walking spanish down the hall

all my conversations I'll just be 
talkin' about you baby 
borin' some sailor as I try to get through 
I just want him to listen 
that's all you have to do 
he said I'm better off without you 
till I showed him my tattoo 
 
now the moon's rising 
ain't got no time to lose 
time to get down to drinking 
tell the band to play the blues

WHEN YOU AIN'T GOT NOBODY

 Well when you ain't got nobody, anybody looks nice 
Don't take much to make you stop and look twice 
And it's either feast or famine, I've found out that it's true 
And I'm hungry as a bull dog, baby how about you 
And when you ain't got no big mama, all the mamas look hot 
And when lovin' is you weakness, your just bound to get caught 
And the story never changes, history tells it so plain 
And I'll be your Dick, honey, if you'll just be my Jane 
And when you ain't got nobody, anybody looks nice 
It don't take much to make you stop and look twice 
And it's either feast or famine, I've found out that it's true 
And I'm hungry as a bull dog, baby how about you, baby how about you

WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND

 (Tom Waits) 
 
I've grown up here now 
All of my life 
But I dreamed 
Someday I'd go 
Where blue eyed girls 
And red guitars and 
Naked rivers flow 
 
I'm not all I thought I'd be 
I always stayed around 
I've been as far as Mercy and Grand 
Frozen to the ground 
I can't stay here and I'm scared to leave 
(Just kiss me once and then) 
I'll go to hell 
I might as well 
Be whistlin' down the wind 
 
The bus at the corner 
The clock's on the wall 
Broken windmill 
There's no wind at all 
I've yelled and I cursed 
If i stay here I'll rust 
I'm stuck like a shipwreck 
Out here in the dust 
 
Sky is red 
And there world's on fire 
And the corn is taller than me 
The dog is tied 
To a wagon of rain 
And the road is as wet as the sea 
And sometimes the music from a dance 
Will carry across the plains 
And the places that I'm dreaming of 
Do they dream only of me? 
There are places where they never sleep 
And the circus never ends 
So I will take the Marley Bone Coach 
And whistle down the wind

WHISTLIN' PAST THE GRAVEYARD

 well i come in on a night train 
with an arm full of box cars 
on the wings of a magpie

and the honkin' of my horn 
i'm callin' out my bloodhounds

last night i chugged the mississippi 
now that suckers dry as a bone 
born in a taxi cab

probably thinkin' its a train 
 
whistlin' past the graveyard 
steppin' on a crack 
i'm a mean motherhubbard 
papa one eyed jack 
 
what you think is the sunshine 
is just a twinkle in my eye 
that ring around my fingers 
just the 4th of july 
when i get a little bit lonesome 
and a tear falls from my check 
theres gonna be an ocean in 
the middle of the week 
 
whistlin' past the graveyard 
steppin' on a crack 
i'm mean motherhubbard 
papa one eyed jack 
 
i rode into town on a night train 
with an arm full of box cars 
on the wings of a magpie 
cross a hooligan night 
i'm ona tear me off a rainbow 
and wear it for a tie 
i never told the truth 
so i can never tell a lie 
 
whistlin' past the graveyard 
steppin' on a crack 
i'm mean motherhubbard 
papa one eyed jack

WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD

 put a dead cat on the railraod tracks 
when the wolf bains blooming by the tressel 
and get the eyeball of a rooster 
and the stones from a ditch 
and wash em down with bilge water 
and say you'll never snitch 
take the buttons from a yellow jacket 
the feather from a buzzard 
and the blood from the bounty hunters cold black heart 
catch the tears of a window 
in a thimble made ofglass 
tell your mamaand your papa 
theycan kiss your ass 
poison all the water in the wishin' well 
and hang all them scarecrows from a sycamore tree 
burn down all those honeymoons 
put em in a pillow case 
and wait next to the switch blades at the amusements park for me 
strangle all the cristmas carols 
scratch out all you prayers 
tie em up with barbed wire 
and push them down the stairs 
and i'll whittle you a pistol 
for reepin' nightmares off the blinds 
those sunsabitches always seem to sneak up from behind 
syphom all the gas from your daddys pickup truck 
fill up jonnys t bird 
i got a couple bucks 
put on little perfume and ribbon in your hair 
careful that you don't wake up the hounds 
tear a bolt of lightning 
off the side of the sky 
and throw in the cedar chest 
if you want me to tell you why 
bring the gear shift knob from a 49 mere 
and lay down here beside me 
let me hold you in the dirt 
and you'll tremble as the flames 
tear the throat out of the night 
sink your teeth into my shoulder 
dig your nails into my back 
tell that lettle girl to let go of my sleeve 
you'll be awoman when i catch you 
as you faqll in love with me 
 
then with my double barrel shotgun 
and a whole box of shells 
we'll celebrate the 4 of july 
we'll do 100 mph 
spendin' someone elses dough 
and we'll drive all the way to reno 
on the wrong side of the road

YESTERDAY IS HERE

 If you want money in your pocket 
and a top hat on your head 
a hot meal on your table 
and a blanket on your bed 
well today is grey skies 
tomorrow is tears 
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here 
Well I'm going to New York City 
and I'm leaving on a train 
and if you want to stay behind and 
wait til I come back again 
well today is grey skies 
tomorrow is tears 
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here 
If you want to go 
where the rainbows end 
you'll have to say goodbye 
all our dreams come true 
baby up ahead 
and it's out where your memories lie 
well the road's out before me 
and the moon is shining bright 
what I want you to remember 
as I disappear tonight 
today is grey skies 
tomorrow's tears 
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here
