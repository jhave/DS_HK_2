WALK ON

 If you don't like what you see 
If you can do better than me 
Walk on 
 
If the road before you winds 
Obscuring al the signs 
Walk on 
 
You mean more to me 
Than just a pretty face 
I wont hold you down 
You need a little space 
 
If you don't like what you see 
If you can do better than me 
Walk on 
 
You know I don't like to fight 
No matter who's wrong or right 
Walk on

 

DEEP PURPLE
WASTED SUNSETS

 The day is gone when the angels come to stay 
And all the silent whispers will be blown away 
And lying in the corner a pair of high heel shoes 
Hanging on the wall gold and silver for the blues 
 
One too many wasted sunsets 
One too many for the road 
And after dark the door is always open 
Hoping someone else will show 
 
Someone is waiting behind an unlocked door 
Grey circles overhead empties on the floor 
The cracks in the walls have grown too long 
The slow hand is dragging on afraid to meet the dawn 
 
One too many wasted sunsets 
One too many for the road 
And after dark the door is always open 
Hoping someone else will show 
 
 


 

DEEP PURPLE
WATCHING THE SKY

 I sit here alone 
I sit here alone 
I look at the walls 
Look at the walls 
Look at the walls 
I look at the walls 
 
You shouldn't be out on your own 
Oh no not with a condition like that 
Oh no sir constant care 
A condition like that, a condition so rare 
A penny for the guy, a penny for your thoughts 
One a penny, two a penny in your pocket 
Ding dong bell, who can tell 
Wild man fisher got nothing on me 
 
I sit by the water 
I sit by the water 
Watch it go by 
Clouds going by 
I'm watching the sky 
 
I left my luggage at the station 
Didn't know how to say goodbye 
I walked away from all the fury 
And the madness and the fury 
And the madness and the fury 
And the madness 
 
I smile to myself 
I smile to myself 
 
You're on the blind side, i'm on the other side 
Now i'm on the outside looking for another side 
Upside down side, i'm still lucid 
I may be crazy but i'm not stupid 
Try to get out, the parking lot's full 
No matter, no matter, what's a man going to do 
One two buckle my shoe 
Zip my lip 
 
 


 

DEEP PURPLE
WE CAN WORK IT OUT

 Try to see it my way 
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go wrong 
While you see it your way 
Run the risk of knowing that our love will soon be gone 
 
We can work it out 
We can work it out 
 
Think of what you're saying 
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright 
Think of what I'm saying 
We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight 
 
We can work it out 
We can work it out 
 
Life is very short and there's no time 
For fussing and fighting my friend 
I have always thought that it's a crime 
So I will ask you once again 
I'll ask you once again 
 
Try to see it my way 
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong 
While I see it your way 
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long 
 
We can work it out 
We can work it out 
 
Life is very short and there's no time

I have always thought that it's a crime

Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong 
While I see it your way 
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long 
 
We can work it out 
We can work it out 
 
At least we can try 
We can try out to work it out someday

WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE

 Roll me over slowly, i've been drinkin' all night, 
Help me make a move, i can't stand the light. 
Wake me, shake me, don't slam the door. 
I ain't been so bad, i just can't recall. 
Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame, 
Lyin' on the floor i can't remember her name. 
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here. 
What's goin onhere? 
 
Went downtown, had a long way to go. 
How i got there, well, i don't know. 
Found myself sittin' in a west side bar, 
Tried to leave but i could not go far. 
High class woman try'n to give me a line, 
Should have left early when i felt so fine. 
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here. 
What's goin' on here? 
 
When they closed up the bar, you know, they left me for dead. 
I can't remember a thing i said. 
Must have called the police to take me away. 
They said, forty days , now i've got to pay. 
Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame, 
Lyin' on the floor i can't remember my name. 
I can't get together while they're messin' with me, 
Keep on lookin' round, tell me where can i be. 
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here. 
What's goin' on here?

WHATSERNAME

 Unforgettable face, i can't think of her name 
It's on the edge of my tongue, gathering dust in the back of my brain 
Something 'bout the way she ignores me that's vaguely familiar 
Makes you wonder what it was you ever did to thrill her 
 
Here we go again 
Here we go again 
Here i go again 
 
I never felt the need to soothe her savage breast 
She never felt obliged to tell me of her change of address 
Caught me on a downward swing but i fell through her arms 
How could i be so careless, i never meant to go so far 
 
Here we go again 
Here we go again 
Here i go again 
 
Oh she's back in town 
Oh she's back in town 
I'm not leaving 
I'm running away 
 
She took it all away, now she's back for the rest 
Took it all so easy, wouldn't settle for less 
She doesn't know what she wants but she knows how to get it 
I can't remember the time, she never let me forget it 
 
Here we go again 
Here we go again 
Here i go again 
 
Oh whatsername's back in town 
She's back in town 
I'm not leaving 
I'm running away 
 
Oh she's back in town 
Oh she's back in town 
I'm not leaving 
I'm running away

WHEN A BLIND MAN CRIES

 If you're leaving close the door. 
I'm not expecting people anymore. 
Hear me grieving, i'm lying on the floor. 
Whether i'm drunk or dead i really ain't too sure. 
I'm a blind man, i'm a blind man and my world is pale. 
When a blind man cries, lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale. 
 
Had a friend once in a room, 
Had a good time but it ended much too soon. 
In a cold month in that room 
We found a reason for the things we had to do. 
 
I'm a blind man, i'm a blind man, now my room is cold. 
When a blind man cries, lord, you know he feels it from his soul.

WHY DIDN'T ROSEMARY

 There's a black hill 
We had a climb 
Everything I need but nothing's mine 
Satan's world, I've had a kill 
Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill? 
Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill 
Oh man won't do it, but the devil will 
 
I'm losing time and my mind 
Why can't I ever have what's naturally mine? 
I got life and the things that go with it 
If there's something else, where can i get it? 
Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill 
Oh man won't do it, but the devil will 
 
Well here's my views, I always lose 
Things I want to do are yesterday's news 
Say life's a ball, I've had it all 
Out there in another dance hall 
Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill 
Oh man won't do it, but the devil will 
 
Take me as I am, an excuse for a man 
Wherever I push someone stops my hand 
As a matter of interest, tell me if you will 
Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill? 
Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill 
Oh man won't do it, but the devil will 
 
Oh, why won't Rosemary ever take the pill?

WICKED WAYS

 You're so hot, you're so cool 
I can see that you're nobody's fool 
Now tell me am I coming through 
It's too late, I can't wait 
Believe it's gonna be a big mistake 
But I'm tempted to believe in you 
 
I don't want to run and I don't want to fight 
I just want to be the one you love tonight 
Unclose my eyes, let it be 
 
Bring on the band of angels from the great divide 
I'll never get to heaven so take me for a ride 
Fruit on the tree is shaking, my mind is in a daze 
I just want a taste of your love 
And learn your wicked ways 
 
You're so bad, it feels good 
There's so much I never understood 
Oh Mama take a look at me now 
I'm hung up, strung out 
All I want to do is scream and shout your name 
Addicted to you somehow 
 
Electric in your touch there's magic in your kiss 
You know I never knew that love could feel like this 
Unclose my eyes, set me free 
 
Bring on the band of angels from the great divide 
I'll never get to heaven so take me for a ride

WILD DOGS

 (bolin/tesar) 
 
This baggage handcuffed to my wrists 
I drag it everywhere i go 
Sometimes i fight you with my fists 
But if i knew which way was home 
 
Before the karma cut me loose 
Would bring me whisky and my water 
Sometimes i get the blues 
Though i know i shouldnt oughta 
Thats where i d go 
 
Run down ghost trail, no chance of love 
No sign of life, just wild dogs howlin in the night 
Oh, that's what i like 
 
Before the karma cut me free 
Im sick of my own company 
Sometimes i miss the boat 
Most times i miss my home 
Thats where i d go 
If i new which way was home 
 
Run down ghost trail, no chance of love 
No sign of life 
Just wild dogs howlin' in the night 
 
Hear em howl...

WOMAN FROM TOKYO

 Fly into the rising sun, 
Faces, smiling everyone 
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition 
I feel it in my heart 
 
My woman from tokyo 
She makes me see 
My woman from tokyo 
She's so good to me 
 
Talk about her like a queen 
Dancing in a eastern dream 
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river 
That carries me away 
 
My woman from tokyo 
She makes me see 
My woman from tokyo 
She's so good to me 
 
But i'm at home and i just don't belong ... 
 
So far away from the garden we love 
She is what moves in the soul of a dove 
Soon i shall see just how black was my night 
When we're alone in her city of light 
 
Rising from the neon gloom 
Shining like a crazy moon 
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire 
I get high 
 
My woman from tokyo 
She makes me see 
My woman from tokyo 
She's so good to me

YOU CAN'T DO IT RIGHT (WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE)

 Have you ever thought of the feeling 
I get when I'm alone with you 
It's causing me worry and trouble 
I'm going 'round in circles 
Don't know what I'm gonna do 
 
You can't do it right 
With the one you love 
Nothing you can do 
Without the one you love 
 
You were always playing my records 
When I was after making some love 
But I need more than the music 
To keep myself together 
Although it makes me feel so good 
 
You can't do it right 
With the one you love 
Nothing you can do 
Without the one you love 
 
Sometimes in the morning 
I wake up without you 
Can't get up, it's getting me down 
Tell me what you're trying to do 
Later in the evening 
You come home feeling low 
If you'd stop your cruising 
Maybe we could make a show 
 
You can't do it right 
With the one you love 
Nothing you can do 
Without the one you love

So hard to see you are taking your chances with me. 
If i find you with some other man 
You know what i'm gonna do. 
Better run if you see me comin', ah. 
 
Soon you will fall, making mistakes like before. 
When you tell me lies i can see by the look in your eyes. 
If you think you're gonna take me for granted, 
Chasin' round with all you see, 
Gonna make you live to regret it, ah. 
 
You fool no one, waiting to see if i'm gone. 
So clear to see you've had all your chances with me.

YOU KEEP ON MOVING

 You keep on moving 
Far away far away 
You keep on moving 
Far away far away 
Everyday wheels are turning 
And the cry still returning

You put your arms around me 
Like a circle 'round the sun 
Dance across the seasons 
To a place that no one knows 
Where angels fear to tread
