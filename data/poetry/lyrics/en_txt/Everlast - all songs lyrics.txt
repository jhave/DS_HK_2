2 PIECES OF DRAMA

 2 pieces of drama 
The hammer's bout' to fall 
2 pieces of drama 
there's gunplay in the hall 
2 pieces of drama 
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire 
2 pieces of drama 
Boy you know not to play with fire 
 
He rocks a big ??? caber 
A ping pong table for a ring 
He's mentally unstable 
To him murder it ain't no thing 
He'll do you dirty style 
He's holding dirty bile 
He's out pumping on the corner 
Trying to stay warm 
And keep it cool like Miles 
 
He keeps it fundamental 
He's got the jeans and the bubblegoose on 
There's murder on his mental 
He's got the deuce deuce in his palm 
 
And y'all know the fable 
How cain did able 
Ever since the beginning 
The world keeps pinning just like a turntable 
 
2 pieces of drama 
The hammer's bout' to fall 
2 pieces of drama 
there's gunplay in the hall 
2 pieces of drama 
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire 
2 pieces of drama 
Boy you know not to play with fire 
 
La la la la la la la la (B Real Hand on the Pump sample) 
 
When it's selling out back 
Likes to pump crack 
To the fiends that be getting high 
He keeps his hand on the pump 
He's ready to dump 
On any chump that would even try 
He got a finger on the trigger 
He ain't scared to pull it 
Head full of liquor 
Boy you might catch a bullet 
They're holes in stable 
Drugs on the table 
Everybody's sitting round 
Watching cops on the cable 
Dressed like a slob 
Keeps his hair braided 
He's never been robbed, 
He's only been raided. 
He's never known joy 
The boy is so jaded 
He's never been loved 
He's only been hated 
His soul's on ice 
His heart is stone 
Just another dead king 
Rotting on his throne 
With a pain that would 
Cut you down to the bone 
You're born alone 
Boy you die alone

7 YEARS

 It's been seven years down the road 
I got no more tears in me left to flow 
I went and I did my baby wrong 
And she left me lonely for so long 
Now I'm out here all alone 
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home 
 
CHORUS (2x) 
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home 
 
It go one for the treble, two for the bass 
Used to mess with this girl way back in the days 
She was from the PJs and she went both ways 
Yeah, the girl was a freak, I used to call her Monique 
And before I even speak about knockin' the boots 
She say her name been changed to avoid lawsuits 
So now we getting' down to the nitty of the gritty 
She brought a friend 'round and damn, she was pretty 
But Betty was twisted, said her number was listed, 
Grabbed my love two fisted, hugged it and kissed it 
They say one in the hand is worth two in the bush 
But when shove came to push, yo, I have my own theories 
World series of love, it's two on one 
Until I got caught with the smokin' gun 
'Cause wifey came home and she bursted in 
Now I'm lookin' for my heart like I'm made from tin 
The road that I travel ain't got yellow bricks 
My old woman thinks that all men are pricks 
And she flipped the script, she put lip to lip 
And every time I think about it I just lose my grip 
 
'Cause I've been up and I've been down 
And I've been fast and I've been slow 
And I've been square and I've been round 
And I've been high and I've been low 
And I've been cool and I've been calm 
And I've been kind and I've been crass 
I held the whole right in my palm 
I tried to spread it around but it sho' went fast 
 
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home 
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home 
Bring my baby home 
 
Seven years sure done flown by 
I got no more tears in me left to cry 
I went and I did my sugar bad 
I lost the best thing I ever had 
Now I'm out here on my own 
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home 
 
CHORUS (4x) 
 
Bring my baby home...

BABYLON FEELING

 My heart is broke, my will is gone 
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon 
She hooked me to the gills 
With all of her forbidden thrills 
I call her baby for short then I ramble on 
She'll forget about me 
My soul is high, my mind is free 
Met a shorty with some back call her destiny 
She showed me all my fates 
My stream of conscious navigates 
I orbit around the sun at high velocity 
Don't forget about me 
 
Don't forget about sweet thing 
Won't you save my soul 
Pretty lady, won't you take me home 
Sweet thing 
Won't you save my soul 
Pretty lady, won't you take me home... tonight 
 
My arms are heavy, my body's tense 
Got the hots for this honey named confidence 
She points out all of my flaws 
Breaking all of her favorite laws 
Never speaks a word in my defense 
Just forget about me 
My spirit's weak, my lust will thrive 
Got a thing for this bitch 
Said her name is Alive 
She controls me with her fear 
My prayers fall on her cold deaf ear 
She says have a good time and take your dive 
Just forget about me 
Just forget about 
 
Sweet thing, won't you save my soul (Yeah) 
Pretty lady, won't you take me home 
Sweet thing won't you save my soul (Yeah) 
Pretty lady won't you take me home... tonight

BLACK COFFEE

 She smelled like flowers 
She tastes like toffee 
She kissed me slowly 
She held me softly 
Got too close and she backed up off me 
And left me stone cold sober just like black coffee 
Just like black coffee 
 
She told me that she'd always be thinkin' of me 
She said she wanted me to know that she really did love me 
She said she never put no one else above me 
Except her monkey 
She's like a junkie 
Just like a junkie 
Just like a junkie 
 
It was April 25th, it's up around 80 
Found a spot out in the park where the grass is shady 
She said her mom's from Jamaica 
Said her father's from Haiti 
Such a pretty lady 
She's such a lady 
 
She smelled like flowers 
She tastes like toffee 
She kissed me slowly 
She held me softly 
Got too close and she backed up off me 
Left me stoned cold sober just like black coffee 
Just like black coffee 
Just like black coffee 
Just like black coffee

BLINDED BY THE SUN

 I met a woman in West Virginia 
Said her name was Alabama 
She from a little town outside Savannah 
Where everyone talk that country grammar 
She said she killed a man down in Atlanta 
He beat her and he drank til he couldn't stand up 
He told her that he loved her but he couldn't stand her 
She caught him in his sleep hit him with a hammer 
Then she sold her car and she bought a gun 
Johnny Law got her on the run 
Another broken bottle and the damage done 
We've all been blinded by the sun 
 
Blinded by the sun... 
 
Her breathe was sweet, her eyes were pretty 
She said her zodiac sign was cancer 
She was on her way to New York City 
Trying to get a job there as a dancer 
Then she asked if she could ride home with me 
Now I'm still thinking on the answer 
She pulled on love She don't take pity 
She'll break your heart if you give her the chance to 
If Grandma's got an Uzi and it weighs a ton 
Johnny Law got her on the run 
Another broken bottle and the damage done 
We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun 
Sun sun sun 
 
Lord have mercy on me for all the things I've done 
I've lost my mind, my eyes were blinded by the sun 
Don't forsake me Lord I'm not the only one 
I've lost my mind, my eyes were blinded by the sun 
Blinded by the sun 
 
And Grandma's got an Uzi and it weighs a ton 
Johnny Law got her on the run 
Another Broken bottle and the damage done 
We've all been blinded by the sun blinded by the sun.

BROKEN

 You're the air that I breathe 
The sun when it breaks through the clouds 
You're all that I need 
But I know that you're having some doubts 
Beggin' you please girl 
I'm sorry I let you down 
 
I'm broken like a promise 
I'm shattered like a dream 
I'm broken with all my pieces scattered 'round for you to see 
I'm broken like record 
I sing the same old song 
I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long 
Girl what about you 
What about you girl 
 
It's so hard to speak 
I can barely look you in the eye 
It's so hard to breathe 
I know I ain't afraid to die 
Your breath is so sweet 
Your kisses could get me high 
My heart is so weak 
But your loving could get me by 
 
I'm broken like a promise 
I'm shattered like a dream 
I'm broken with all my pieces scattered 'round for you to see 
I'm broken like record 
I sing the same old song 
I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long 
Girl what about you 
What about you girl 
 
I'm broken like a promise 
I'm shattered like a dream 
I'm broken with all my pieces scattered 'round for you to see

CHILDREN'S STORY

 [1st child] Uncle Whitey! Uncle Whitey, could you tell us a bedtime story? 
[2nd child] Dat's 'at! We wanna hear a bedtime story 
[1st child] Please! Could you tell us a bedtime story? 
[2nd child]with fingers in the mouth tidgy poo na na 
 
[Everlast] 
Once upon a time not long ago, 
when people wore pajamas and lived life slow 
When laws were stern and justice stood, 
and people were behavin' like they ought to: good 
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy 
and this is what he said 
 Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash, 
robbin' old folks and makin' the dash 
They did the job, money came with ease, 
but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease 
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother 
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover, 
the cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic, 
He said, keep still, boy, no need for static , 
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap 
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped, 
the kid pulled out a gun 
He said, Why'd you hit me? , 
the barrel headed straight for the cop's kidney 
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure, 
 I'll do years if I pull this trigger 
So he cold dashed and ran around the block, 
cop radios in to another lady cop 
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister, 
a shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her 
Looked 'round good in expectations, 
so he decided he'd head for the subway stations 
But she was coming so he made a left, 
he was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath 
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him, 
then he made his move to an abandoned building 
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor, 
opened up the door there, guess who he saw 
Dad, the dope fiend shootin' dope, 
who don't know the meaning of water nor soap, 
He said, I need bullets, hurry up, run , 
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun 
He went outside but there was cops all over, 
So he get into a car, it was a stolen Nova 
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university, 
Escaped alive though the car was battered, 
He rat a tat tatted and all the cops scattered 
Ran out of bullets but still had static, 
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic 
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead 
He told the cops, back off or honey here's dead , 
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong 
so he let the lady go and he starts to move on, 
sirens sounded, he seemed astounded 
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded, 
he dropped the gun, so went the glory 
And this is the way I got to end this story, 
he was only nineteen, in a madman's dream 
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream, 
this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
Just another case 'bout the wrong path, 
straight and narrow or your soul gets cast 
G'night

DEADLY ASSASSINS

 [Everlast] 
What? You think it can't happen? 
Soul Assassins 2000! 
Word! Goes somethin' like this 
 
On a vision quest fresh best error terror 
Krush Groovy like a low budget movie 
I'm Wild Style like Lee Quinones 
Stop ridin' on my cajones 
I talk with a speak that's much unique 
While you desperately seek for that Susie freak 
Yo, word to Rob One. He used to like the big ladies 
My name's Everlast, I started back in the 80s 
Like (whoosh sound) all up your nostril 
Actin' hostile, 13th apostle 
Goin' postal, Holy Ghost know 
Why you walkin' on the hostrow, actin' bicoastal 
Bitch! Try to play the middle, 
Snitch and wind up in the hospital 
Cat on a hot tin roof with no fiddle 
Put your money in the middle, get broke like coal 
 
[B Real] Two deadly assassins makin' 'em fall 
I'm Real 
[Everlast] I'm Everlast, and I'm takin' 'em all 
[B Real] Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape 
[Beide] Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate 
 
[B Real] 
I'll spit out the fighting, you won't know what hit 
Watch me place you out quicker than the joint gets lit 
I got piss in me, shit, what do you got? A couple? 
If you gotta hustle, what d'you want, trouble? 
Lookin' at the two who go back like Chuck's (Everlast: way back) 
With the hand on the pump by the big black trucks (Everlast: fools) 
You can't trust a soul in the City of Angels 
The strange ho's want a piece, look at these lame ho's 
I stain those, with hot blood and chain flows 
And main foes who want to rock this ain't closed 
They use the same clothes these unoriginal niggas 
Ah, my son, if any one of them wanna run (Everlast: Come on, motherfucker) 
I'll ? chastized and baptized in blood 
Where the gat lies don't matter, you're scattered in mud 
You ungrateful, most hateful, leech niggas 
Wallow in your misery, I'm outta reach, niggas 
 
[B Real] Two deadly assassins makin' 'em fall 
I'm Real 
[Everlast] I'm Everlast, and I'm ready to brawl

DEATH COMES CALLIN'

 (Yes, yes, y'all. 
'S too fresh ya'll. 
A little B boy blue. 
You know it's too beaucoup.) 
 
I been from New York to Cali but today's in the valley 
And I think I'm 'bout to lose my mind 
If I think about it one more time I'm a blow my stack, see out the back 
Give me some room that I can breathe in, and I'm a start weavin' 
spells like a wizard, king of the lizard 
My mojo's risin' like my nature should 
Not everybody can relate to th' hood 
But they used to could with high frequency 
Had the habits of juvenile delinquency 
If y'all could see all the things I did when I was a kid, 
you might flip your lid 
'Cause when I was the age of one, 
my father gave me my very first gun 
When I was the age of two 
I was pullin' out records with the SD crew 
And when I was the age of three 
I had all the maddest fishes swimmin' after me 
And when I was the age of four 
I was bustin' out shows with the rhymes galore 
 
CHORUS (2x) 
I say day to the night, night to the day 
Up around where I stay we do things this way 
You got to watch how you act and watch what you say 
Cause there ain't no stallin' when your death come callin' 
 
CHORUS II (2x) 
The man that lives by the pistol dies by the smokin' gun 
I think I hear a steam whistle, Lord; when my train goin' come? 
 
Yo, all you done's packin' guns, fightin' for one, 
It's time to get these Huns, start raisin' some sons 
Plant your seed in some fertile soil 
And watch me start bubblin' like I'm 'bout to boil 
Like Olive Oyl loved Popeye, just won't stop I 
Got to keep rockin'. Ticks keep tockin'. 
Time keeps slippin'. My mind keeps trippin'. 
Man, the road less traveled sure got a lot of stones. 
 
CHORUS 
 
(Watch me break it down) 
There's a red house yonder just over the hill 
With my name carved into the windowsill 
Think I'm goin' to burn it down, yeah, think I'm going' to burn it down 
It's where me and my old woman used to stay 
We used to lie in bed and make love all day 
Now I think I'm goin' to burn it down, yeah, I think I'm going' to burn it down 
Think I'm goin' to burn it down to the ground. 
 
CHORUS II 
Lord, when my train goin' come? (4x)

ENDS

 CHORUS: 
Ends 
Some people will rob their mother for the ends 
Rats snitch on one another for the ends 
Sometimes kids get murdered for the ends 
So before we go any further I want my ends 
 
I knew this cat named Darrel who didn't have a dollar 
He was Harvard material, Ivy League scholar 
Had a Ph.D., had an M.B.A. 
But now he's waiting tables 'cause there's rent to pay 
Companyies downsizing, inflation's rising 
Can't find a job, he's feeling kinda stressed 
Doesn't even feel the effects when he's 'sessed 
Forgot to count how many times he been blessed 
So he falls off track, starts smokin' the crack 
And once it hits his brain it starts to chain react 
Sells the shirt off his back, shoes off his feet 
He's losing all his teeth now he's out in the street 
And all of a sudden he's like Jesse James 
Trying to stick up kids holding watches and chains 
But he's from business school and he's nervous with a tool 
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool 
For the 
 
CHORUS 
 
I knew this chick named Sally she had a nice strut 
And everywhere that I went she was up in the cut 
Swingin that butt like place ya ad here 
Only rappin' mens that rock the fly gear 
Brand name wearin', champagne wavin' 
Jewels around her neck, a lotta style she's cravin' 
Ain't no savin' she's doin' all spendin' 
If you do the lendin' she'll do the bendin' 
Straight machine vendin' it's money for take 
Shopping sprees get her on her knees 
And if you hit her with the keys to your crib you actin' funny 
Come home one day, find her countin' out your money 
From the Wetlands all the way to the Apollo 
If you're broke she's spittin', if you're rich she might swallow 
For the 
 
CHORUS 
 
I knew these two home boys that made a lot of noise 
Makin' money on the block and kids was on they jock 
They was tougher than leather like Reverend Run 
DMC, they was totin' guns 
Holdin' weight, going outta state 
Stacking mad chips and pushin' phat whips 
Fly jewels and clothes and got no job 
And then one disappeared and one got robbed 
For the 
 
CHORUS (2x)

FUCK EVERYONE

 I don't do work I do damage, everytime I pick up the mic I manage 
To diss someone or get somebody pissed 
Take off my coat, clear my throat and begin to dismiss 
All you fucked up punks that pollute mankind 
Give me the mic take a hike, give me a piece of mind 
Don't shout shut your mouth I'm trying to think cleary 
You say my rhymes are dope check it out 
This is nearly the start of something big like startin' a fire 
You think the party is here, I'll take the level higher 
I'm Everlast get off your ass you cut my rug you understand my game plan 
You say man that kid bug, soya blood cotacs if you like the key 
Now I'll stomp your head till you're dead or at least till you bleed 
 
Fuck everyone! 
 
It's the Syndicate I say what I want to, 
I say, Hey fuck off punk just to taunt you 
Into believing the ryhmes I say are meant for one thing 
And that's achieving my goal 
So I can stroll where the fat money rolls, 
'cross the bridge over trouble waters 
Pay the toll with no bother, no fuss, 
In God I trust but the rest pay the cash that's a must 
The reason I'm teasin' you is it's pleasin' me to see how funny this can be 
When I grab the mic I'm like a three wheel bike 
I'm always on a roll, I'm always good as gold, 
So before you smack lip stick and try to talk shit 
I'll tell you now the battle's over and the joint is lit so quit 
 
All hell breaks loose and it's a little known fact 
T hat I attract and cause a crowd to react 
Like an atomic explosion of the pacific ocean 
The crowd gets large and I got this notion 
All I wanna do is speak my rhyme and get paid 
'Cause I'm in a trade to not be played and watch suckerss get slain 
Put out of business, come on what is this, you came too late, boy 
Class been dismissed, canceled, terminated put on a natural brake 
North, find a new school to attend 'cause you know I'm goona say what I wanna 
I'll grab the microphone and let my knowledge be born up, intelligence 
Excellence, razor sharp wit, it's known shit, it's always gotta be legit 
And up to par no matter who you are, 
I know I'm not the best but I still leave scars on your brain cells 
What the hell... 
 
Fuck Everyone! 
Everybody...Fuck'em... (2x) 
Every everybody fuck'em! 
 
I got Tipper Gore protestin' my lyrics, 
Fuck that bitch I don't need a clearance 
To write my rhymes, speak my mind, 
You can't censor me the public's not blind 
It's time they knew whats goin' on, 
You shouldn't have the power to stop a song 
Even if you don't like what you hear 
Even if the song is strikin' fear into your heart 
Body, soul and brain it's my opinion so it's my domain, 
Fuck all those standin' in my way 
Step to me and you'll have to pay what I say so pay your debt 
You fuck with me and you'll have regrets 
 
Fuck everyone... 
Fuck'em (2x)... 
Fuck'em now... 
Fuck the fed now fuck'em now... 
Fuck'em everybody! 
We don't want to hear bullshit niggers... 
Fuck Everyone (2x)... 
Fuck'em 
Now, fuck you HAHA... 
FUCK'EM!

 

EVERLAST
FUNKY BEAT

 Check 
Uh huh 
Check check, y'all 
 
[Everlast] 
Yo, Whitey Ford's the name. The hunchback of Notre Dame 
Couldn't get more bent when it's time to represent 
And I control it like rent in a slum tenement 
Life's hard like some men in the concrete jungle 
I don't smoke jumbos, so what you knockin' for? 
There's locks on my door 
We rock from the floor to the ceilin' 
Ain't no drug dealin' 
Ain't no cat peelin' 
You can't fight this feelin' 
 
[Casual] 
Well, 
My style's golden, hot like molten rock 
Niggers come bold but leave here holding jock 
High roll patrol roll through the set on fifth 
Armed solo, sippin' momo with a chick 
Niggers takin' penitentiary chances at the dances 
Lettin' off shots, lit off the lanterns 
Mad 'cause a nigger can't test with no access to phatness like this 
 
[Sadat X] 
From one stone the cowboy was founded plus surrounded with Casual 
and Whitey Ford the whole world and your girl 
From the bay to L.A. to my blue N.Y. 
I ain't tryin' to die, I'm tryin' to live well, to cool out 
I pick up my daughter when the bell says the school out 
Who the hell brought a tool to this peaceful event? 
Now I can love you, front you, or leave to hunt you 
To play it too close is to be hit with this dose 
 
[Everlast] Yes, yes, y'all 
[Sadat X] Freak, freak, ya'll 
[Casual] So fresh, y'all 
[Everlast] To the beat y'all 
[Sadat X] Yes, yes, ya'll 
[Casual] We don't stop, y'all 
[Everlast] We keep it rockin' til the panties drop, y'all 
 
[Casual] 
I seen that rap is bein' ruined by you and whoever doin' 
That crap, they got me booin', in fact, I'm getting' to 'em 
A electro poetical surge gave me the urge to consume the tomb and submerge 
The depths the adverbs 
Can't depict the sick 
Analyticals 
You pitiful trick 
I'm the pinnacle and the prodigal 
Rhyme style's 
Hypnotical 
Fuck the article 
The art is hardest 
To harvest the hard shit 
 
[Sadat X] 
I slave till all my work is done 
I'm cash hit 
Stack up my money for a Grammy shit 
I like them all house parties rockin' 
Plus I been getting' cozy 
Bitch, turn your head and keep your eyes 
Where they supposed to be 
Supposedly I was seen with something lean, huh 
Brown skin 
I keep it bouncin' 
I say loungin' 
On the side with red wine 
I know that shit on my floor ain't swine 
 
[Everlast] 
Now back it up, stack it up and hit me one more time 
It might be your phone call but check it, it's my dime 
And I know she's fine, but get off my line 
Or I'll break that spine 
And then maybe your face 
You all up in my space 
Like with Puffy and Mase 
But that's just not the case' 
Cause I'm settin' the pace 
While you followin' and swallowin' 
Savorin' the flavor 
In your audio for now 
Quick suckin' my style 
 
CHORUS 
Rock on 'til the break of dawn, just freakin', yeah, baby 
Rock on 'til the break of dawn, just freakin', yeah, baby 
'Cause this the funky beat, 'Cause this the funky beat, 
'Cause this the funk, the funk, the funk funky beat 
'Cause this the funky beat, 'Cause this the funky beat, 
'Cause this the funk, the funk, the funk funky beat 
 
[Sadat X] 
I'll leave a piece of my style 
Flyin' high up in the air 
And you'll say to yourself 
Damn I'm glad I was there 
This is as rare as me frickin' share 
You people stare 
But behind closed doors 
You will take it there 
 
[Casual] 
Yeah I be the extraordinare 
Judge from Bayfare 
To Albee Square 
Tell me where the party at 
I'll be there 
Let her hit the coney at 
Show her where to ride the pony at 
 
[Everlast] 
I be the man 
With the large amounts of savoir faire 
I'm about to cut loose my dog so you all best beware 
If you can dance with flare then get out your chair 
We be smarter than your average boo boo bear 
 
CHORUS

 

EVERLAST
GET DOWN

 Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down, get down (4x) 
 
I see everybody rockin' the same old style 
And everyone sportin' the same profile 
And all y'all wearin' the same name brands 
I hate everybody jackin' these played out jams 
I won't reach for no gun, punk, I'll use my hands 
I rock mikes and roll bikes across foreign lands 
I made my bones out in zones where the twilight be 
And every time I touch the mike it's Fright Night Part Three 
For every MC that won't test and try 
In your custom made wears thinkin' you too fly 
Makin' up in gold chains what you lack for brains 
It's time to call your ma, Dupe, and scoop up your remains 
And finally lay to rest all the shit you stressed 
And boastin' and braggin' 'bout the toes you taggin' 
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door 
While every rapper that's simp gets pimped like a whore 
See it's August 18th, three quarters past four 
When the doctor slaps my ass hear the lion roar 
The record sales soared then the world got toured 
You say what happened to my band, I say I just got bored 
Now they call me Whitey Ford, and I say, Praise the Lord 
If I ain't breakin' up your coos, cats, we're singin' the blues 
Strummin' and pickin' like I'm B. B. King 
It's Abdul Baqi now watch me do my thing 
 
CHORUS: 
Down, down, you go 
Down, down, so low 
Down, down, till you hit the floor 
Keep fallin' down until you can't get down no more 
 
Go point blank range with the scope he's knockin' 
The psycho might change but there ain't no stoppin' 
The moon's on the rise when the sun start droppin' 
And y'all need to quit the bullshit you poppin' 
'Cause I been hip hoppin' since BDP. 
Drop the P and spree it's Abdul Baqi 
And when referrin' to me you'd best respect the name 
Make a quick double take and double check your game 
'Cause you about to get dissed I'm checkin' my list 
When I check it over twice it's like rollin' the dice 
I hit four five six I'm all up in your mix 
I rock good from Hollywood's 'hood the city of bricks 
And all these fake cats scream they're keepin' it real 
While you're makin' your deal we'll be breakin' the seal 
You'll be breakin' your vows like people worshipping cows 
And then I'll hit you with the whos, whats, wheres, and hows 
Like Vinnie Barbarino. I'm at a good chino 
Sippin' homemade vino with the Brooklyn Lordz 
Crashin' the boards with my soul in a hole 
I'll take you back to the future from the days of old 
I'm too cold to hold, too hot not to burn ya 
Don't stick your nose in business that don't concern ya 
I might have to trip and flip like Ike Turner 
You too old for schoolin', boy, when the money learn ya 
 
CHORUS

 

EVERLAST
GODWANNA

 

 

EVERLAST
GOODBYE

 Na Na Nahh Na, Na Na Nahh Na, Hey, Hey, Hey...Goodbye! 
Goodbye, it's over 
we're through 
it's done 
our relationship is no longer one on one 
so I guit girl 
I don't need this 
I'm disgraced 
'cause in my face 
you spit 
I quit stepin' out wit another guy 
after givin' you my love I deserve to know why 
how long has this been going on 
how long have you been doin' me wrong 
you thought I didn't know 
you thought I wouldn't go 
well, that's why I'm makin' this song 
to say goodbye 
 
Na Na Nahh Na, Na Na Nahh Na, Hey, Hey, Hey...Goodbye! (2x) 
 
Pack your bags 
get out of sight 
I won't see you with a man on any night 
you try to play me like a fool 
but now you see you've been schooled 
by the E 
and it's plain to see 
you thought you had luck like a four leaf clover 
well, your luck just ran out 
home girl it's over 
I hope you had a lot a fun 
were you lyin' when you said I'm numba 1 
well, I guess it don't matter 
it makes no difference 
I caught you wit' a smokin' gun 
or so to speak 
girl you a natural born sneak 
and the hand you delt me was really weak 
but that's alright, you won't see me cryin' 
I brush a girl off when I catch her lyin' 
so when I toss you out 
don't dare ask why 
don't try to return wit' a tear in your eye 
that's just my way of sayin' goodbye... 
 
Na Na Nahh Na, Na Na Nahh Na, Hey, Hey, Hey...Goodbye! (2x) 
 
Usin' me, 
Confusin' me, 
Inside you abusin' me 
You think I'll stick around so you can keep abusing me 
Wise up girl, I ain't playin', 
You try to make it better sayin' 
Let's hit the hey and make love 
Then I know that your loyal 
But I can't take the stress, I don't need the termoil 
You told me that you love me but it was a lie 
You know that I care, but I must say goodbye 
Who is it that you thinkin' about when we kissin' 
And when we all alone is it him that you're missin' 
I couldn't stand the feelin' when I see another man in my spot next to you 
So what you want me to do? 
Forget about it? 
Act like it never happened? 
Turn the other cheek and wait to get slapped again? 
Or until you say when? 
You're through with me but you will see 
I'll be the first to say b y e 
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why, 
It's just my way of sayin' goodbye 
 
Na Na Nahh Na, Na Na Nahh Na, Hey, Hey, Hey...Goodbye! (2x) 
 
I must admit it, you hit it well 
Did you get your kicks puttin' me through hell 
Runnin' around with your new found child, he's not a man 
He can't get wild, but that's alright, girl, you made your choice 
And maybe by now you're sick of my voice, but it's too bad 
'Cause you made me mad, 
And I'm gonna show you all the things that you might've had 
Then you'll be the one feeling pain and misery 
Regretting the past (goodbye) 
'cause you're history 
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why, 
Don't tug at my sleeve as I walk by 
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye, 
It's just my way of sayin' goodbye 
 
Na Na Nahh Na, Na Na Nahh Na, Hey, Hey, Hey...Goodbye! (2x)

 

EVERLAST
GRAVES TO DIG

 They go one for the Prophet, two for Islam 
Three for the Khutba from the Imam 
Four for the mother that birthed my frame 
Five for the father 'cause he taught me game 
 
Been 'round the world, songs are all the same 
Sometimes when I'm asleep I still call your name 
Back when I was young I used to dream of fame 
Now they all point they fingers sayin' who's to blame 
Mothers put their girls into pigtail curls 
Fathers teach their sons how to shoot their guns 
They say, Boy don't never cry control your emotions 
Just take it like a man, make your stand 
They say, Sex and violence go hand in hand 
For every man blessed there got to be ten damned 
Expand through the depths of space and time 
Standin' three eyes blind on the firing line 
Word to my man divine, come too far, 
Singin' la ilaha il allah 
Twelve rakahs short on my full day's prayer 
Just hoping that the lord got some mercy to spare 
They go one for the ummah, two for the deen 
Three for the angels, four for the alamin 
Somewhere between totally obscene 
And perfectly clean, got a Babylon feelin' 
Wounds that need healin', truth need revealin' 
Hands need washin' from all the dirty dealin' 
From the floor to the ceilin', from the stage to the door 
From the kings and the queens and the slaves and the whores 
For every lost cause where the martyrs are found 
That funky little sound, that make you want to get down 
Somebody told me once, love makes the world go round 
Now kids they carry pistols out on the playground 
That profound, gone too far. 
Praying to the light from a burned out star 
Put your lights on, put down your crosses 
It's time to tally up your wins and your losses 
They go one for Scott La Rock 
Two for Pac and B.I.G. 
And three for all the mothers who got graves to dig 
For all the mothers who got graves to dig 
For all the mothers who got graves to dig

 

EVERLAST
GURU

 Hey, yo yo Everlast. What up? 
This is big Guru from the Gangstarr, you know what I'm sayin'? Just checkin' in on ya. Yo, I heard about your accident, I want to know if you're still breathin'? So get at it brother, you know how to reach me, kid. Word is bond, man. I miss ya. Hit me up, peace.

 

EVERLAST
HOT TO DEATH

 Boy, let me breakin' it down (Yeah) 
You got to know the feel 
'Cause them (triple eyes) will break out the hypertest steel on ya, boy, 
And you got to know the life 
Yeah, feel the life, you know what I'm sayin', you know what that's like (Hey) 
You know that, come on! 
 
Say what's gone wrong, you know it just ain't right 
Tell me who be left when the spark ignite 
From the break o' daylight to the fall of the sun 
You gotta pick your fight it's time to choose your gun 
 
CHORUS: 
Front to back, right to left, 
Keep it live all night, make it hot to death 
Get your heart pumpin' like some crystal meth 
Keep it live all night, make it hot to death 
 
(Well) 
(Hey) 
 
Tell me who's your God? Does He make a lotta dough? 
Will He take you higher, or to the fire below? 
 
CHORUS 
 
Guns to roses, Abraham to Moses, 
Daylight exposes what the night conceals 
Let's break these seals and get this thing started 
Some be outclassed and some be outsmarted 
Some be overwhelmed by the blinding rays 
And hear the whisper in the night, get trapped in the maze 
See, back in the days when I was juvenile 
I dreamed of rockin' on the mic in a brand new style 
Now I'm shakin' these bones tryin' to get these shoes 
I've been in major coos, I've paid crazy dues 
Now I'm speakin' on music, a slap on knee 
A rumor start spreadin' just like a disease 
I'll have you down on your knees be b'low the spot ground zero 
Turn brown and burn down Rome just like Nero 
A hero ain't nothin' but a 
(listen) 
don't make me say it again 
Don't make me say it 
 
CHORUS

 

EVERLAST
I CAN'T MOVE

 Watching the sun shine 
Peeking over the sky line 
Thinking I gotta get mine 
Gotta try at least one time 
Wanna get near it 
Close enough to fear it 
Close enough to hear it 
Close enough to say 
That I looked it in the eye 
Then I turned away 
 
And I'm not scared 
But I can't move 
I'm not scared 
But I can't move 
 
Hangin' out on a weeknight 
Looking out for the street light 
Getting into some fistfight 
Trying to cling to my birthright 
Wanna get near her 
Close enough to smell her 
Close enough to tell her 
All the things that I want to say 
Then I looked her in the eye 
Made her run away 
 
And I don't care 
But I can't move 
I don't care 
But I can't move 
 
Laying up in the Soho 
Looking out of my window 
Pulling back on some indo 
Watch the breeze as the wind blows 
Wanna get near it 
Close enough to hear it 
Close enough to fear it 
Close enough to say 
That I looked it in the eye 
Then it turned away 
 
And I'm not scared 
But I can't move 
I'm not scared 
But I can't move

 

EVERLAST
I GOT THE KNACK

 You got it (13x) 
 
Get up everybody and listen to this rhyme 
My name is Everlast and yo I'm always on time 
I got what it takes to make this groove complete 
When my DJ cuts he's never missin' a beat 
I'm down with the Syndicate and they're down with me 
I'm also down with Divine, Bilal and Quincy D 
Terry B., DJ Lethal and my brother Kool Nick 
Kid Jazz, Scratch, Bangle and Cut Master Quick 
I worked hard and long to master this traight 
And to quote my other song, yo I'm just out to get paid 
 
So sleep on me now, 
For my time will come 
Everlast lasts forever 
That's why I'm number one 
 
I got the knack (7x) 
 
Everlast is in effect, gettin' full respect 
I collect big checks, 1's, 5's, 10's, 20's, a 100 G's 
I'm pullin' honey's left and right, day and night 
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight 
There all on my tip to get a sip of this poetic performer 
I can get whipped but I'm out to get paid, not to get laid 
All across the country my records gettin' played 
The radio stations, clubs and renkores 
All the shows I play I make them do encores 
 
So sleep on me now, 
For my time will come 
Everlast lasts forever 
That's why I'm number one 
 
I got the knack (5x) 
 
(Ah, yah, hit me, alright, check this out) 
Step up place your bet and I'll serve your fortune 
But first I must issue just one word of caution 
Dope lyric presentations are my soul notiriety 
Everlast is on the rise movin' through society 
My voice is moist resighting choice vocals 
Respected world wide and feared by locals 
Poppin' junk out your punk mouth 
Makin' bets it's too late for regrets 
It's time to pay your debts, E v e r l a s t 
It's the name that I fed a poetic demigod with skin that is fare 
 
I got the knack (10x) 
 
Now there are too many people in this world tryin' to play me 
Like I'm some kind of sucker constantly they disobey me 
Tellin' me what's sellin', what kinda records be charted 
Sound like him, sound like her but they all sound retarded 
Takin' very little time to write down a rhyme 
It's confusing to see so many people so fly 
Some think that it's a sell out rhymin' to this beat 
But Everlast takes any groove and makes it sound complete 
 
I got the knack!

 

EVERLAST
LIFE'S A BITCH

 Yeah Yeah 
Whitey Ford and the likwit 
2000 zero zero 
Party just started 
 
I got the complex subjects 
The roughneck stature 
The jerk factor results and bone fractures 
Manufactured sounds and images 
Got me scramblin' like football scrimages 
Johnny Unitis 
In god I trust 
I don't need to get paper everytime I bust 
Maybe I'll do it for charity 
Now my label want to jerk me for my royalty 
I guess thats what you get for loyalty 
Life's a bitch don't take the shit personally 
 
CHORUS: 
Life's a bitch don't take it personally (3x) 
Life's a bitch don't take it personal 
 
Call me a visionary advasary 
Known to bust cherry on a young berry 
Now tell me how much weight can your back carry 
And tell me how far have you come now 
Im sick of all these fake rock B boys who think they down 
'cause they got a tattoo and turn their hat round 
Their all my sons just call me Sam 
Recognize who I am boy we ain't fam 
This ain't the sopranos 
You know I roll with the rythm cubanos 
And billions get served like McDonalds 
So get the fuck on before I give you a tray 
Year though I ride through the calley in my blinged up whip 
I don't fear no evil pumpin' full clip 
'cause you ain't nothin but a bitch to me 
By 2002 you'll be history 
 
CHORUS 
 
Yo I motivate to propagate my oral linguistic 
Mystical science act of defiance 
Bitches get slapped on non compliance 
Catgorize me with industry giants 
I'm callin shots like my man chick hearn 
I can mix your burn while you wait your turn 
I get respect in this here and that's hard to earn 
I don't do it for the paper I got money to burn 
My sole motivation is rock the whole nation 
Make a rhodes scholar out of a dust patient 
All you drug addicts with the thug tatics 
You might go to jail if the charge really sticks 
 
Life's a bitch don't take it personally (7x) 
Life's a bitch don't take it personal

LONELY ROAD

 

 

EVERLAST
LOVE FOR REAL

 Her skin was salty sweet 
She wore sandals on her feet 
Side by side we fell asleep in her mother's bed 
She stepped inside of me 
Said don't ever lie to me 
This heart of mine can be yours 
Yeah that's what she said 
But I just played the role, broke the heart I stole 
Cause I was young and dumb and fucked up in the head 
 
Do you want to be loved for real 
Do you want to be loved for real 
Do you want to be...loved 
(Yes, I wanna be loved for real) 
For real 
(Do you want to be in love for real) 
(Yes, I want to be in love for real) 
 
Now, I'm down by the river 
Taking off my shoes 
Jumpin' in the water 
Wash away these blues 
And out into the ocean 
The current takes hold 
 
Words already been spoken 
Tales already been told 
Heart's already been broken 
Wounds already been healed 
Do you wannabe loved 
Do you wanna 
Do you wannabe love for real 
 
Do you want to be loved for real 
Do you want to be loved for real 
Do you want to be...loved 
(Yes, I wanna be loved for real) 
For real 
(Do you want to be in love for real) 
(Yes, I want to be in love for real) 
 
Do you want to be...loved 
(Yes, I wanna be loved for real) 
For real 
(Do you want to be in love for real) 
(Yes, I want to be in love for real) 
 
Her eyes were hazel brown 
She laughed the sweetest sound 
And I just loved the way she lit up when she spoke 
She helped to ease my pain 
She stayed through pouring rain 
And I gave her all thit she could take, 'till she broke 
She fit me like a glove 
She taught me how to love 
And for some ass I watched it all go up in smoke 
 
Do you want to be loved for real 
Do you want to be loved for real 
Do you want to be...loved 
(Yes, I wanna be loved for real) 
For real 
(Do you want to be in love for real) 
(Yes, I want to be in love for real) 
 
Do you want to be loved 
(Do you want to be in love for real) 
(Yes, I wanna be loved for real) 
For real 
(Do you want to be in love for real) 
(Yes, I want to be in love for real) 
 
Do you want to be loved 
(Do you wanna be, do you wanna be ... in love) 
For real 
 
Do you want to be in love 
(Yes, I want to be in love for real) 
(Do you want to be in love for real) 
Yes, I wanna be 
(In love for real) 
In love for real

 

EVERLAST
MAYBE

 Maybe you could take a lil' piece of my pain 
Maybe you can make it all feel the same 
Maybe you can burn this night in my brain 
Maybe you can find someone else to blame 
For all this pain 
 
Maybe 
 
Maybe you could tell me about your worst fear 
Don't say it out loud, whisper in my ear 
Ain't never felt nothing' like this here 
Maybe you can see things a lil' more clear 
Dry away your tear 
 
I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking 
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often 
Maybe I should give this woman my name a piece of my pain 
 
Maybe 
 
Maybe we can talk about all my dreams 
Watch them all come apart at the seams 
Sometimes when it rains it really teams 
Sometimes they cut diamonds with laser beams ..whatever that means 
 
I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking 
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often 
Maybe I should give this woman my time that would be fine 
 
Maybe 
 
I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking 
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often 
Maybe I should give this woman my name a piece of my pain 
 
Maybe

 

EVERLAST
MERCY ON MY SOUL

 A trust betrayed a rusty blade 
Standing the edge 
I walked the line, paid my fine 
Hope I know the ledge 
Actual facts, unnatural acts 
Sins they take their toll 
The angel and the djinn and the beast within 
The fight to take control 
 
Lord, have mercy on my soul 
On my soul 
On my soul 
On my soul 
 
Lord, I need ya like a junkie needs his drugs 
Need ya like a baby boy needs his hugs 
Need ya like the flowers, Lord, need the sun 
I need you like D.M.C needs Run 
 
Lord, have mercy on my soul 
On my soul 
On my soul 
On my soul 
 
Lord, love you like a Eskimos love the cold 
Love you like a miner man love his gold 
Love you like a fisherman love the sea 
Love you like the flowers love the worker bee 
 
Lord, have mercy on my soul 
On my soul 
On my soul 
On my soul 
 
Standing up tall on top of the wall 
Hoping I can fly 
Angel and the djinn and the beast within' say I'm gonna die 
 
Lord, have mercy on my soul 
On my soul 
On my soul 
On my soul

 

EVERLAST
MONEY (DOLLAR BILL)

 [Everlast] 
Dollar dollar bills, Deutschmarks, francs, yens, and pounds 
I rock the chopped up sounds from Devonshire Downs 
Out the Fordham Road 
Up top in the boogie 
I be loyal to my peeps like Buddha stud Doogie 
Never very bad news, payin' crazy dues 
I'm billowin' out crews and tamin' mad shrews 
Like Bill Shakespeare. 
The fakes'll disappear 
The flava in your ear is strong like Everclear 
Two hundred proof so put the match to the roof 
and set this bitch on fire. 
Get rich, the empire's about to strike back 
if you rock the mic whack and that's the way it is, 
'cause yo, it's like that 
 
[Sadat X] Money, money, y'all 
[Everlast] It be the root of all evil 
[Sadat X] Money, money, y'all 
[Everlast] It makes you popular with people 
 
[Everlast] 
I go back to the 80s, like 'Three Times a Lady' 
When it was pussy for free and crack for currency 
It just occurred to me, it's time for surgery 
I remove MCs like tumors, the lies and the rumors 
got me thinkin' of this dub by Timex Social Club 
Yo, word to my momma. I'm high off the trauma 
Whitey Ford gets deeper than the subway trains 
and I serve lazy fools like fast food chains 
all pain, no gain makes the brain insane 
life in the fast lane deflates the cash gain for real 
 
[Sadat X] Dollar bill, y'all, dollar bill, y'all, dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill y'all 
[Sadat X] Dollar bill, y'all, dollar bill, y'all, dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill y'all 
[Everlast] It takes money 
[Sadat X] to get that fly ass ho 
[Everlast] It takes money 
[Sadat X] to see me rock a live show 
[Everlast] It takes money 
[Sadat X] to get that last bag of smoke 
[Sadat X] 'Cause the count ain't 'xactly for you when that ass is broke 
 
[Everlast] 
Yo I'm 'bout to G off just like my name was Eddo 
Black kids call me Whitey, Spanish kids Wetto 
White kids call me king of this B boy thing 
If it's broke then fix it, if it's whack you mix it 
Can't none of you MCs ever fuck with these 
You'll be crazy on my dick like some porno chick 
For the style that I'm blessin'. Ain't no second guessin'. 
Kid, heed the lesson, subtraction, addition 
Reward for submission, ain't no debate 
Won't stop till I'm eatin' off a platinum plate 
I want the stocks and bonds, plus the real estate 
I want the iron gates and low interest rates 
Plus a fly little spot to bring all my dates 
A little stash of the cash put aside in a safe 
For when times get lean, y'all know what I mean 
 
[Sadat X] Money money y'all 
[Everlast] some be calling it cream 
[Sadat X] Money money y'all 
[Everlast] some be callin' it 'fetti 
[Sadat X] Money money y'all 
[Everlast] but once I get it I'm jake 
 
[Sadat X] Dollar bill yall, dollar bill yall, dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill yall (5x) 
 
[Everlast] 
I want cash and checks, I want diamond rings 
I want jewels on my neck and mad fly things 
I want stacks of fat chips so I can take long trips 
I want to sail the Bahamas on my own cruise ships 
I want acres of land, I want papers in hand 
I want stocks and bonds all pros, no cons 
Hey, if it smells funny then back it up honey 
I want the money, y'all 
I need the money, y'all

 

EVERLAST
NEVER MISSIN' A BEAT

 Listen up, learn, you'll get your turn 
I'm sendin this out to all it may concern 
The party master Everlast is here 
Before we begin I'm gonna make this clear 
I take no short cuts, Bilal adds dope cuts 
If girls were around I'd grab and grope butts 
And if she got a man and he tries to step up 
It's ashes to ashes and dust gets swept up 
Tryin to step to me, boy, you must be sick 
Got a nine in my pocket, takin heads out quick 
I make my music loud, my parents proud 
There's not an artist alive drawing a better crowd 
Than the Everlasting operator droppin a groove 
To make you get up and dance while I bust this move 
And talk about myself, I don't need a partner 
Bilal has the cuts, then I'll help start the 
Show, let a lyric flow and you'll know 
I make you jump up out your seats, scream and say ho! 
You fall back down completely exhausted 
Once you had the sound, but now it seems you lost it 
You're worn out, you can't take no more 
Since Everlast and Bilal took control of the floor 
So jump out your seat, move your feet cause the beat's complete 
I'm never missin a beat 
 
(Never missin a beat) > George Clinton 
 
There's no need for askin, I'm the Everlastin 
My mind is a poll and I'm gonna cast in 
The ocean of words and pull out a new rhyme 
And if it feels good, then I'll do it two times 
Or maybe three, four, or even five times 
When I'm done Bilal cuts up my rhyme 
He's my partner, not a stand in 
On a 'highway to heaven' just like Mike Landon 
And when it comes to battles my boy's a sure win 
He's been in more scandals than J.R. Ewing 
Busted up more parties than five o 
When it comes to a fight my boy's good to go 
So step on stage, we duke it out like men 
I beat you down with every word that flows out my pen 
And I was the Green Hornet Bilal'd be Kato 
Right by my side kickin up dust 
And if a sucker acts stupid, grab my gat and bust 
You can't run away cause my clip holds ten rhymes 
If you been beaten once, I'll beat you ten times 
Worse than you ever been beaten before 
I don't drop my mic unless my throat gets sore 
And that don't happen because when I'm rappin 
My rhymes'd beat Gregory Hines if they was tappin 
So jump our your seat, move your feet cause the beat's complete 
I'm never missin a beat 
 
(Ain't it funky) 
 
Lyrical and linguistic, somewhat artistic 
Some call me a devil, others call me mystic 
al like a crystal ball 
And if you step to me you'll take a fall 
Just like the Roman Empire 
Feel the wrath of a devil's hellfire 
Callin me a devil, some think it's a diss 
To me it's just a name, it's not stones and sticks 
You can't hurt me, I got a positive outlook 
Readin my good book 
Or maybe some philosophy like Socrates and Plato 
Step to me with drugs, I just say no 
But I'll drink some lemonade if it's ( ? ) 
I'm down with DLC and the Styler 
The D i v Einstein of rhyme 
Is down with me cause he knows that I'm 
On my way I will not stray 
From the path of knowledge that'll earn my pay 
I think for myself, I take advice 
And if I did it wrong once, then I do it twice 
I check my steps, make sure they're correct 
And that's why me and DLC get respect 
So jump our your seat, move your feet cause the beat's complete 
I'm never missin a beat

 

EVERLAST
NEXT MAN

 (And there, but for the grace of God, go I. 'S kinda deep. I wonder what it means?) 
 
I'll rock a jam for love, I'll quit my band for love 
I'll smack a chrome tool right out your hand for love 
Make you cry like a dove, leave you standin' alone 
In a world so cold, watch the drama unfold 
'Cause you sold your soul. Now you fearin' your death 
Sniffin' crystal meth 'til there ain't nothin' left 
But rock bottom hurts when you hit it 
You start to perfect on all the friends you've shitted 
You prob' won't admit it so you start to sink lower 
You caught in the flood and you tryin' to find Noah 
If you hungry and you near me, yo, you gonna get fed 
If you sleepy and you need a place to lay your head 
Then come take my bed. I'll sleep on the floor 
Cause these are the times that friends are for 
 
CHORUS (2x) 
I see everybody out here's doin' for self 
And they don't give a damn on the next man 
Puttin' status and wealth over God and health 
I can't wait 'til you the next man 
 
I get uptight for love. You know I'll fight for love. 
I might keep my wifey up all night for love. 
And when the daylight comes I'll be seein' mad bums 
With no shoes on their feet, plus nuttin' to eat. 
I can't save the whole street, so I feel like I'm beat. 
And why play the game when nuttin' goin' change? 
The only change that's wanted is loose in my jeans. 
I get rushed on every corner by a bum or a fiend. 
Tryin' to keep my dean, I try to give to the poor. 
Tryin' to get through this life and get through that door. 
I'm all up in this mix for these final ticks, 
Goin' all the way to seven and it's half past six. 
 
CHORUS 
 
I'll pray to God for love. I'll make jihad for love 
And I just might pull your freakin' card for love 
Make you sing, Hey, love , like my man King Son 
I freaked all the noise over all you toys 
Better bring your boys, summon all your crew 
No matter what you do, it's comin' back on you 
It's like planet orbits, let your sponge absorb its 
Logical conclusion. It's b boy fusion. 
And confusion say that he want control 
Of your mentality, your body and your soul. 
So if you lose your hope come and take my hand 
And link up this chain, cause, money, that's the plan. 
Tryin' to get through this maze, not to win this race, 
We either ridin' on a horse or walkin' on our face. 
So come take your place on the side of love 
And swallow up ego and your pride for love 
 
CHORUS 
 
I can't wait 'til you the next man 
I can't wait 'til you the next man

 

EVERLAST
ON THE EDGE

 I'll assure you and ensure you you're the one I love 
All the Gods up in heaven sent you from above 
Sent you down to Earth just to make me smile 
Don't you know you're the only thing that's worth while 
In my life, be my wife, don't turn me down 
You're the best, so say yes and I will never frown 
You know you got me on the edge of happiness and despair 
Doesn't matter if I slip cause I know you're there 
To catch my fall, all in all I'm havin a ball 
Whether we're dancin and romancin or leanin on the wall 
When I'm with you, girl, I could never be bored 
You're so fine and you're mine yes, I thank the Lord 
Every minute of the hour, all hours of the day 
There's one thing I been dyin to say 
I love you 
 
You got me on the edge (2x) 
 
We met by chance, I walked in when you were workin 
I gave you a glace, advanced and caught you smirkin 
At me, the E v e, you know the rest 
I asked you for your number and began my quest 
To conquer your heart, body, soul and mind 
You came around and I found that you were one of my kind 
So I laid the same old drag, whispered in your ear 
But that didn't work and I started to fear 
That you might be too much woman for Everlast to handle 
In my eyes no girl could hold a candle to you 
I was confused hey yo, what's my next move? 
My boys said, Relax E, and act real smooth 
But that approach wasn't workin and I realized 
That this girl was really different 
That scared me a little but it also intrigued me 
I wanted to know if you were serious, not tryin to lead me 
On, so I confronted you and asked you the time 
You said you felt the same way for me and that you'd be mine 
Forever 
 
You got me on the edge (2x) 
 
So there we were, a match made in heaven 
I was thinkin about you girl, 24/7 
Every minute, every hour, all day and night 
In my bedroom or the shower or when ridin my bike 
You're on my mind all the time and my rhyme's redefined 
Secret letters to you and they're boldly signed 
By me because I love you and I always will 
And the thought of bein without you girl, makes me ill 
I love you, I need ya, I'll clothe ya and feed ya 
You'll never be lonely cause I'll always be there 
We'll be together side by side 
And when I'm out with my boys I brag about you with pride 
I took a picture of you wherever I went 
Took you anywhere you wanted, no matter what I spent 
I have to admit girl, your lovin was def 
But it tore me apart when you left 
But now I realize I'm the one to blame 
I took a thing like love and turned it into a game 
And even though I regret it, I couldn't let it 
Show cause I didn't want you to know 
The pain that I was feelin deep in my heart 
But now I think I'm ready to make a new start 
With you 
 
You got me on the edge (4x) 
 
Well, we've been through a lot together 
Throughout the stormy weather 
The only thing I'm sure of is love lasts forever 
I know my love is true and I know you love me too 
There's only one thing left for you and I to do 
Regain the bond that we once had 
And once we accomplish that girl, we'll both be glad 
I'm better off for it, you can't ignore it 
The love that we feel, we both cherish and adore it 
So let's stick with it through joy and through sorrow 
Take it one day at a time and not worry about tomorrow 
 
You got me on the edge

 

EVERLAST
ONE AND THE SAME

 Wish I could see beyond the filthy blue horizon 
See what lies ahead of me 
Perhaps I'd see the path of my own destruction 
And avoid my destiny, 
 
She said, Heaven and hell are one and the same, boy 
She told me, Heaven and hell, boy, are one and the same 
We all meet somewhere in the middle 
She told me, Heaven and hell, boy, are one and the same 
I said, It can't be true 
 
Wish I could touch you in some totally new fashion 
Prove to you girl I'm a man 
Now I can't guarantee your complete satisfaction 
So I'm goin' do you very best way I can 
 
She said, Heaven and hell are one and the same, boy 
She told me, Heaven and hell, boy, are one and the same 
We all meet somewhere in the middle 
She told me, Heaven and hell, boy, are one and the same 
I said, It can't be true 
 
Wish I could find some time to stop and smell the roses 
But my land lord just won't let me be 
My head is full of paranoia, neurosis, trying to consume my identity 
 
She said, Heaven and hell are one and the same, boy 
She told me, Heaven and hell, boy, are one and the same 
We all meet somewhere in the middle 
She told me, Heaven and hell, boy, are one and the same 
I said, It can't be true 
 
It just can't be true 
Children grow and women produce, men go work and some go steal'n 
Children grow and women produce, men go work and some go steal 
(Heaven & Hell, here on Earth) (8x)

 

EVERLAST
ONE, TWO

 [Everlast] 
Yeah, yeah, two thousand, zero, zero 
The party just started, ha ha, ha ha 
Everlast, Kurupt (Kurupt: Fred Wright Kurupt) 
Goes somethin' like this 
 
I say one, two, one two one two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one two one two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
I say one, two, one two one two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one two one two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
 
[Everlast] 
Sticker man tryin' to feed his baby 
Drug dealer tryin' to raise his son 
Every pimp gotta dress his lady 
Come on now you ain't the only one 
 
I say one, two, one two one two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one two one two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
I say one, two, one two one two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one two one two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
 
[Kurupt] 
Now this is the combination of intervention 
That just might open up a new dimension 
I can tell, the well, just might run dry 
Lost attentions and thoughts, mighty fine to simplify 
 
I say one, two, one two one two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one two one two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
I say one, two, one two one two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one two one two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
 
[Kurupt] 
I said life lasts present to the past 
Saw a rapper the warpath (warpath) 
Kurupt, young Goddie 
Incredibly clever, mack auther with Everlast it's true 
Do what you want do 
One, two 
 
[Everlast] 
Mary Jane wanna run smoke reefer 
Little Ricky's out sniffin' rock 
Cynthia, she's at the disco coked out 
Doesn't matter what drugs you on 
 
I say one, two, one two one two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through

[Kurupt] 
Gain, growth, life by a oath 
The gifted, different toast 
Talent, the melodramatic 
And the violent life in silence 
B ut this here's mine, crystal clear it's mine 
 
I say one, two, one two one two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
I say one, two, one two one two 
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
I say one, two, one two one two 
The good Lord knows just what you've been through

ONLY LOVE CAN BREAK YOUR HEART

 (from Big Daddy soundtrack) 
 
 
When you were young and on your own 
How did it feel to be alone 
I was always thinking of games that I was playing 
Tryin' to make best of my time 
 
But only love can break your heart 
Try to be sure right from the start 
Yes, only love can break your heart 
And live your world sure from the heart 
 
I have a friend I've never seen 
He hides his head inside a dream 
Someone should call him and see can come out 
Try to lose the down that he's found 
 
But only love can break your heart 
Try to be sure right from the start 
Yes, only love can break your heart 
And live your world sure from the heart

 

EVERLAST
PAIN

 Somewhere between the lies and truths, borderlines get shady. 
Somewhere between the yeses and nos you can find a maybe. 
Somewhere between the highs and lows you can spot the middle. 
Somewhere between the questions and clues you can solve the riddle 
Somewhere along the road you might need a place to stay. 
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to pass away. 
And somewhere in space you still remind me of a reason. 
And summertime you still smell like my favorite season. 
 
Chorus: 
And it feels like pain 
It's just like pain 
Love is like pain 
Some people like pain 
 
Somewhere between the mountain and sea a river is flowing 
Somewhere between the earth and the sky, the winds of change are blowing 
Somewhere between the two of us a space is growing 
Somewhere between suspicion and trust are the things worth knowing. 
 
Somewhere along the road you might want to hitch a ride 
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to swallow your pride 
Somewhere inside you still remind me of a feeling 
Somewhere deeper still are wounds that are not healing. 
 
Chorus 
 
Put your nails in my hand .Pain 
Fill my eyes up with sand Pain 
Papercuts on my tongue Pain 
We're right now where we begun Pain 
 
Somehow I only hurt the ones who really mattered 
Somehow she played her role although her soul was battered 
Someday soon I know my ashes will be scattered 
Someday soon I know my former becomes latter 
 
Chorus

PAINKILLERS

 (Flight attendant, filtered: On behalf of Pan Am Airlines [sounds of toking], we'd like to be the first to welcome you to New York City. We'd like to thank you for flying Pan Am [cough]. The local time is 6:45 AM, and the temperature is 89 degrees.) 
 
I've been up all night on the red eye flight 
The dawn's early light got the skyline bright 
I'm in the back of a car of service. The driver's kinda nervous 
cause I'm tokin' on a blunt that's phat 
He say You know where you at? 
I say I know where I am, and if you really want a tip then Mister, don't get flam! 
I ain't tryin' to be rude, and I ain't stressin' you, Gramps, 
But this shit right here, it be the breakfast of champs. 
I been tokin' on this since thirteen years old 
And when I look up at my wall I see platinum and gold 
And ain't nobody sneezin' at the money I fold 
And I ain't here for your pleasin' so put that shit on hold 
Just keep your mouth shut and get me to the hotel 
and turn the radio up while I finish this El. 
 
(Bell boy: Welcome to the Five Seasons, Mr. Ford. Your usual room is ready and waiting. Let me take your luggage. If you need anything while you're staying, just let me know! 
Everlast: You're good lookin' out...That's for you.) 
 
I hop out my car, step into the lobby 
Everybody's on the floor. It's a mother fuckin' robbery! 
The shit's in progress. I can feel the stress 
I wonder silently to God, How'd I get in this mess? 
They tell me to freeze and get down on my knees 
Between my jewels and my cash I'm holding 35 Gs. 
They told me to run it, so I got bold and I fronted 
And like Slick Rick said, I know I shouldn'ta done it 
'Cause now they're standing over me, watching me bleed 
Damn! I got to quit smokin' all this weed 
There's a pain in my chest, but yo, I must be blessed 
Because before I faded out I saw the EMS 
And the paramedics, they greet me with some anesthetics 
They killin' my pain, they screamin' my name 
Tryin' to keep me in the conscious world 
I'm thinkin' bout my mom, my sister and my girl 
I'm prayin' to God, don't let this go too far 
As they rush me into the Saint Luke's O.R. 
They pull the bullets out my chest and give 'em back in a jar 
Now I'm wearin' this scar 'cause I tried to play hard 
 
(Doctor: Mr. Ford, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. 
Everlast: What are you talkin' about? 
Doctor: It would appear that one of the bullets grazed your spine, and damaged the cord. 
Everlast: So what are you tryin' to tell me? 
Doctor: Well, suffice I have to say to say I don't think you'll be jumpin' around any more. ) 
 
Yo! This can't happen to me! I just can't believe it! 
Trapped in a wheelchair! A paraplegic! 
There ain't no rehab, there ain't no therapy. 
For the rest of my life, someone's gotta take care of me! 
And people stare at me with pity in they eyes 
And every morning I rise to a life I despise 
And every night I think I might never rock the mic again 
'Cause my brain's fucked up on Percocet and Vicodin 
Might as well be heroin pulsin' through my veins 
Gotta kill these pains or blow out my brains 
To free me from these chains. 
I'm trapped in this physical hell. 
To walk again I might just sell my soul 
And I'm only twenty somethin' years old.

 

EVERLAST
PASS IT ON

 (Ladies and gentlemen we have) 
Everlast 
(In the house tonight I think they got somethin they wanna say) 
 
I'm here to uplift, I don't bug, I don't drift 
Away from my subjects, not even if 
My music stops or my beat is gone 
I'm just here to express myself and pass it on 
 
(So funky) 
 
Speakin much words of wisdom, Everlast has the jism 
So sit back, relax, kick up your feet and listen 
To E cause that's me, no others can be 
Half as fine, I blow your mind with an m i c 
Get off the tip quick, boy, you're makin me sick 
No other partner could be smarter than my man Kool Nick 
Understand, he's my man with the plan 
We come to parties with the posse just to gain some fans 
The posse is strong, the lines are long 
People flockin to my shows just to hear a song 
Like this, it's not a diss, it's a mouthful of bliss 
Throw your hands in the air and blow me a kiss 
From the crowd cause I'm proud, I say my name loud 
Everlast pounds sounds like a thundering cloud 
It's not rock 'n roll, it's hip hop music 
It's got a lot of soul if you learn how to use it 
Well, I'm here to tell suckers go to hell 
Others tried to take me down but they're the ones who fell 
Ignorance was their downfall 
Take it a little at a time, don't go for it all 
At once cause that's stupid, it don't make sense 
Just relax and move your body, don't look so tense 
I'm not here to diss nobody, I'm just havin some fun 
Everlast last forever, that's why I'm number one 
So pass it on 
 
With a forty in my fist breakin out my list 
Of all the suckers I'm cold about to diss 
There's none to match me or even catch me 
Off my guard, so that they can scratch me 
Off the MC all star team 
Everlast is number one, that means I reign supreme 
Cause there ain't no others, listen up brothers 
Just because I'm white don't mean that I'm another 
Sucker on the microphone frontin and fakin 
Not Mexican, Asian, black or Jamaican 
Just a sensation made to be caucasian 
Get ready brothers, here comes an invasion 
Don't try to stop it, you got a rhyme? Drop it 
You might detect that respect's my topic 
I won't rush it but I'll discuss it 
Go ahead and pop your shot if you think that you can bust it 
But I'ma go on, I'm gonna talk some more 
I guarantee you won't be bored if you get on the floor 
And go for yours and say that you get it 
 
Get up, get out your seats, get on the floor and get with it 
And listen to the rhyme I like to call mine 
I re rehearsed every verse and soon you will find 
Not one mistake, so don't try to break 
Or talk about takin out the dope rhymes I make 
Just pass em on 
 
You're goin wild for my flow and style 
I don't stutter, I utter words versatile 
I'm entertainin with my brain and always wearin a smile 
I don't front, I don't fake, I run the whole mile 
You clap cause my snap is like a crocodile 
Whether I'm on stage or in my domicile 
I'm not fiendin, I don't smoke, I tell you I'm no joke 
You're schemin for my lyrics cause you know I did dope 
Don't give me no Mo t, pour me a glass of rose 
And I'll say 'skal' to your health and then I'll blow you away 
Not Simple Simon on the ( ? ) just rhymin from Long Island 
The rungs on the ladder of success I'm climbin 
Fierce like a lion keepin ducks tame 
Murderin two bit MC's until none remain 
Cold gettin dumb, I'm number one shinin like the sun 
With a mic in my holster and I'm on the run 
Gunnin down MC's and writin on the walls 
I'm ready for a showdown if you got the balls 
Commence, face my offense cause you're makin me tense 
I make a lotta dollars but I make more sense 
So pass it on 
 
Pass it on, pass it down the line 
I can throw with the best and go rhyme for rhyme 
With any sucker claimin talent, thinkin that he got some 
But what you do not realize is Everlast is number one 
Cause Everlast is on a superior level 
Go ahead and laugh, call me a devil 
I won't care, yeah, my skin is fair 
But I still go rhyme for rhyme anytime or where 
With you or any party or crew 
And when I finished you're diminished, take a sip of my brew 
And step off, clear my throat with a cough 
And bust a move to show and prove that I'm hard not soft 
And with my DJ Bilal my beat will be furnished 
You find with my rhyme your mind will be nourished 
With wisdom and knowledge, yeah, I went to college 
And if you get dissed I won't apolog 
ize, cause that's a part of my rise 
And I go on and on, I go to any length 
Just to show that when I throw my rhymes on the strength 
I like to see the crowd movin when I come on 
I'm just tryin to get my message across and pass it on

 

EVERLAST
PRAISE THE LORD

 You know it's Whitey 
And the Likwits 
I say it's Whitey 
And the Likwits 
You know it's Whitey 
And the Likwits 
 
Watch me rock these sounds from the Polo Grounds 
To the Sunset Strip. I'm like an acid trip. 
I'll flash it back on ya, run it up on ya, 
I'm born in Hempstead, L.I., raised in California 
Mister entrepreneur, I rock the shot that's sure 
I need a dime plus more, I've sipped the fine liqueur 
I want the cash in hand and the beachfront land 
And I'll get loco from Acapulco to Japan 
Mister Whitey Ford gets terrain explored 
You perpetrate that fraud you must be out your gourd 
It's time to make like Greg Nice, kid, and praise the lord 
Keep the faith. Smoke an eighth. 
Continue stackin' papers all up in my safe 
Commence to motivate, assume an altered state, 
And kill your whole whack show like I'm Edgar Allan Poe 
With a psychotic thriller. No peckerwood's iller 
Than this freckle faced man with the farmer's tan 
If I can't bomb on you I'm bombin' on your man 
 
CHORUS: 
Some get the shit, sugar. Some get the stains 
Some get the muscles, baby, some get the brains 
Some get the powers, love, some get the papers 
And some catch the vibes and some catch the vapors 
Better 
Praise the Lord! Keep the Faith! (4x) 
 
Say roll to the rock, rock to the roll 
Whitey Ford brings the devastatin' mic control 
Like Derrell McDaniel, a hundred G's annual 
The tips get clocked, baby, the bonds get stocked 
My style gets rocked just like doors get knocked 
With legendary status like my name's Lou Brock 
In my lands are sounds be shakin' the grounds 
Huntin' down crews like packs of bloodhounds 
Snatchin' off crowns and meltin' 'em down 
I once was lost, see, but now I'm found 
Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
And when the saints come marchin' in 
I'm Nestle Alpine White, classic rapper's delight 
All these shorties pullin' tools 'cause they know they can't fight 
I bank my selections on world wide connections 
So get the seven digits, baby, never burn your bridges 
 
CHORUS (2x)

 

EVERLAST
PRINCE PAUL

 Hey yo, what up Everlast? This is Prince Paul, man. 
Yo, I ran into Trev on the street from Nasty and he said you're doing this dope Celtic rock album. So I was like, yo, that's my style... That's what I do . You know I got beats from back in the days. So I'm like, yo, why don't I give you a call 'cause yo, 'cause you know I got that ill like, you know...You know somethin' like Jump Around but it's more on that like old lucky charm style type, you know.

So yo, I got the joint. Call me...You got my number, I got it. I know what you need...I know what you need, man. I know you got dough. Give me a buzz, peace.

Still got a purpose to serve 
So let your light shine 
Deep into my hole

Let me fade away...

SLEEPING ALONE

 *Phone Rings* 
(Hello?) 
(Hey is she home yet?) 
(No, she's not home yet) 
(All right, thanks) 
Try to get you on the phone 
But your mother always says you're gone 
And you ain't coming home 
Girl I'm sleeping alone 
Try to get you on the line 
And ask you to be mine 
But you're so hard to find 
Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 
Baby girl she makes the good motion 
Make no mistake she's deep as the ocean 
Jake never sleeps in the heart of the city 
And God'll never make another woman this pretty 
And I can never guess why she even messed wit' me 
Word to P.Diddy 
I treated her shitty 
I'm sick of cliches like opposites attract 
When they drop the drum track 
Screaming Baby come back 
Reality bites like pit bull fights 
I jump outta bed and throw on my lights 
Your clothes are all gone 
And you ain't there 
And your makeup drawer is empty 
I found an old picture of you washing your hair 
And now we ain't even friendly 
 
Try to get you on the phone 
But your mother always says you're gone 
And you ain't coming home 
Girl I'm sleeping alone 
Try to get you on the line 
And beg you to be mine 
But you're so hard to find 
Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 
Ain't too many kids that bang like this shorty 
She'll sip champagne 
She'll come drink a forty 
Got a smell that intice 
Dress kinda sporty 
In public she's nice 
In private she's naughty 
I had every man's dream in the palm of my hand 
And fucked it all up like the Taliban 
She left town with my ring and wrecked all our plans 
And I don't even care about the fifty grand 
Man the hell with the cash cause that ain't the point 
We used to sit around and laugh as we smokin' the joint 
We used to watch TV and eat chicken wings 
We had tickle fights 
We did the wild things 
Now I'm all alone up in my room 
This house is feelin' empty 
We used to talk about being bride and groom 
And now we ain't even friendly 
 
Try to get you on the phone 
But your mother always says you're gone 
And you ain't coming home 
Girl I'm sleeping alone 
Try to get you on the line 
And beg you to be mine 
But you're so hard to find 
Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 
Me corazon 
Ain't comin' home 
The sweetest thing I've ever known 
Turned off her phone 
Left me alone 
The pain that cuts down to the bone 
It can't be fixed 
Scars don't heal 
None of these chiks out here is real 
Some of these chicks got sex appeal 
But their souls all come up empty 
Put me in the mix, girl, what's the deal? 
All I'm trying to be is friendly 
 
Try to get you on the phone 
But your mother always says you're gone 
And you ain't coming home 
Girl I'm sleeping alone 
Try to get you on the line 
And beg you to be mine 
But you're so hard to find 
Girl I'm sleeping alone

 

EVERLAST
SO LONG

 (Do you ever have bad dreams? All I have is bad dreams) 
 
I knew a man with a son 
Who bought him a gun 
And learned shorty just how to use it 
Taught him hunting and skining 
Right from the begining 
Built himself a mighty fine killer 
But shorty got picked on 
Beat on and kicked on 
And all his classmates wanna punk him 
So with tears in his eye 
He catch him in a ride 
And told his old man he went hunting 
And he felt so free 
Like his destiny 
Lay somewhere out on the horizon 
His heart went cold 
He felt a hundred years old 
And started pulling back on the trigger 
 
CHORUS: 
I think I'm gonna die today 
And everyone who hurt me's gonna pay 
How could such a short time feel so long 
How could such a young life go so wrong 
 
(What's it gonna take for you to really make it in life?) 
 
See me 
Hear me 
But don't touch me 
You should fear me 
Lived your life dearly 
'Cause I'm seriously disturbed 
That's my word 
Straight to my mother 
Wait, my brother 
Time to find another one to play sucker 
'Cause I ain't the one 
Who put shade in your sun 
And took all your shine 
Watch me get mine 
Feel my love burn 
Me for my sins 
Watch the world turn 
The saga begins 
Losses and wins 
Angels and sins 
Dancin' on top 
Of the head of a pin 
Don't know where I'm going 
But I know where I've been 
I can't hear a sound 
I clapped a full round 
I came to get down 
I came to get dirty 
I came to get even 
 
CHORUS 
 
Momma, don't cry 
Please, momma, don't cry 
Momma, don't cry 
You did nothing wrong

 

EVERLAST
SOUL MUSIC

 You came into my life 
 I don't have to wonder no more, I can feel it all in my soul 
It's Soul Music 
 It's deep down in my soul 
Feel the Burn 
I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul 
 Its deep down in my soul 
It's Soul Music 
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul 
 It's deep down in my soul 
 
Yo, I first took breath in Hemstead, Long Island 
Born in American ancestry from Ireland 
You ain't knowin me, you'd better stop smilin' 
Aint nothin funny once my dummies start whiling 
You talkin loud now all of a sudden it's silent 
Your premonitions say it's about to get violent 
You want permission just to blink your own eyelids 
I got my soldiers, everywhere they go, I win 
No stick moves, aint no cap peeling 
Where I come from real men don't catch feelins 
We don't rhyme about fake jacks or drug dealin 
The shit I drop will leave all your brains on the ceilin' 
Mass appealin, done it since the '80s 
Rock rhymes for my dogs, sing songs for my ladies 
Spend money like crazy, aint got no babies 
If I don't make it in heaven I'll run shit in Hades 
 
Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul 
 Its deep down in my soul 
It's Soul Music 
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul 
 It's in my soul 
Soul Music 
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul 
 It's deep down in my soul 
Soul Music 
Tryin to find an explanation deep down in my soul 
 It's deep down in my soul 
 
Yo I shit on competition 
Spit on percussion 
Beats are bonecrushin 
One deep I'm bum rushin 
Guns they get stuck in 
Someone starts buckin 
The jewels that I'm truckin got pimps upchuckin 
You can't hold me down 
You can't hold my hand 
A full grown man with the one God plan 
 
I represent the colors that never run 
God bless DMC 
God bless Reverend Run 
R.I.P. for the J.M.J. 
Tell Big and Scott LaRock that we all say hey 
Be like Tupac or be like Kid 'n Play 
Do you wanna burn out or just fade away 
I can rock the mic with no delay 
With my head to the ground every time I pray 
You can catch a heart attack or get blown away 
Cause this type of shit happens everyday 
 
Feel the burn 
 I can feel it all in my soul 
It's Soul Music 
 It's deep down in my soul 
Feel the burn 
 It's in my soul 
It's Soul Music 
 It's deep down in my soul 
 
Feel the burn 
Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul 
 Its deep down in my soul 
It's Soul Music 
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul 
 It's in my soul 
Soul Music 
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul 
 It's deep down in my soul 
Soul Music 
Tryin to find an explanation deep down in my soul 
 It's deep down in my soul 
Feel the burn

 

EVERLAST
SPEAK NO EVIL

 I'm in the studio with my brotha the half asiatic 
You know the fraction of black skin and a smidget of white 
It's my brotha Kool Nick 
And we about to drop some science on the this track 
About God and what not and the world... 
 
Step up and bow your head 
Be greatful your hungry for knowledge 
I'm serving a plate full of 12 course meals 
And a black plate of of wax through MC's 
Sit back and relax 
Try to digest the data that I feed you 
I'm actin' this way 'cause I'm bred to the color of my skin 
Something I take pride in 
Still my people insist on hidin' behind the American dream 
And it's like the home of the free 
And mom's apple pie 
I got whiped for the meltin' pod 
I guess not 
Kid stuck up for his rights and got shot 
 
Yah, I speak no evil (2x) 
 
Yo, Nick do me a favor 
Step up! 
 
[Kool Nick] 
His world is crazy 
It must be sick 
Be like Nick 
Get ricious real quick 
Jews, Muslims, Buddah Baptists 
Brought up like the Merry Christmas 
See salvation 
Every pinch of this rhyme is from my heart 
And I meant this 
Jesus...Scattered his blood for me 
He hung on a cross 
You know that story 
Nowadays a lot of people are trying to worship Satan 
But your gonna fry in hell 
I'm never burning up forever 
The forcast see no change in weather 
Damn', the Devil would never twist this mind with the mark of the 666 
Thanks God there no one equal 
 
That's why I speak no evil (2x) 
 
Listen to the story of my savor 
And how he gave up life to let us live 
That's a hell of a gift to give 
Kick it E 
 
Now as I take a look around 
I don't see many people down 
With my cars...Ha, that's scary 
Tryin' to diss the son of Marry 
You being lord take the bait 
And fall into the trap of Satan 
Then your life's over without no sequal 
 
That's why I speak no evil (2x) 
 
Yo, this is weird rhymin' 
Strange brothers are gettin' shaked on the streets with gold chains 
Some smoke crack, cocaine, and Jumbo fried 
When they talk mumbo 
How can this be society 
I front the place where none of us want to be 
People gettin' judged by the skin tone 
It wasn't like this way back with the Flinstones! 
Some times I get kept back because I'm half black 
People can't except that, yoexcept me for what I am 
What did I do 
Because none of us give a damn 
All they want is to drive a Mercedes 
Half a million dollars... 
And live like the Brady's! 
But anyways time is winding 
Not grinding 
lLok in your heart and start finding peace and love 
No matter what your grade is understand the knowledge at hand and believe this 
 
I speak no evil! 
Word up 
We got my Ma Lofy in the house 
Man, my boy Chris 
My brother Low Dog 
My brother Bry 
My lady T 
Yo, we got Shawny, you what's up 
My brother E over there 
Hahaha, you know I speak no evil!

 

EVERLAST
SYNDICATE SOLDIER

 Here we are, my friend. 
Once again 
I'm inclined to rhyme one time. 
So won't you lend me your ear? 
Cuz it's clear 
That this here has no pain 
If this song was the blues you'd be sheddin a tear 
Like a baby 
Maybe 
Is shoulda held back. 
Some of you look shocked 
I guess you couldn't tell that 
I was here to drop knowledge 
College is irrelevant 
My next move, 
To prove I'm smooth but still intelligent 
Expressing 
Lessons with sheer precision 
First hear me out then make a decision 
On whether Everlast knows what time it is. 
Does this song belong in the rhyming biz? 
Yes, I think so, cuz I'm a pioneer 
Blazing the trail across a new frontier. 
I'm growing lengths of growing stregth as I get older. 
Cuz I'm a syndicate soldier. 
 
All affections left behind, 
There's two more gears to grind. 
Before I'm through, 
I'm sure that you will find 
A new respect for the rhymes I inject. 
Through your eardrum, 
Don't play dumb 
Just let me get to the point of my address 
Unless you feel you can't go. 
This song is on the tables to make you dance, so 
Get up, and if you don't, leave the premises 
I'm Rula Ku so you can call me a genesis. 
Born to perform and please a large crowd 
Of people at night and to my right is El o 
The scale is brother, 
Known for being treacherous 
A sucker made a move and that's the reason 
Fletcher was forced to put his head out 
He got too close to me, 
Two by my side 
And that's that's how it's supposed to be. 
These are my brothers, 
And they've been around me 
Since back in the days when the Syndicate found me. 
They are the people deserving of credit. 
List my name, gained fame, and made sure I wouldn't let it 
Go to my head 
Instead 
I keep my feet down 
Unlike sucker's from the past I beat down. 
The fatal mistake was to break on my confidence 
Overall, their fall was due to overconfidence. 
As we go, the ego's 
All start acting up 
With statements 
Of greatness, the rhymes aren't backing up. 
Talking louder as they get bolder, 
But there's no defense 
Against a syndicate soldier. 
 
As we reach the final stage, 
Something got engaged, 
In a conflict, 
That's sick with violent rage. 
I gained fame, 
From my name, Everlast. 
How long can this hype about a devil last? 
A star was formed, but everyone took it serious. 
Now it's seems, I'm seen as delirious. 
That's okay, I'll stay under rated. 
And good things will come to all who have waited. 
For the brother of a lighter skin to begin 
Droppin' knowledge with weight, 
Cuz you rate paper thins. 
Science is one thing, knowledge is another. 
What do I mean when I say that I'm a brother? 
Being a brother is a state of mind 
For all those who chose to remain unblind. 
Growing wisdom as I get older. 
That's right I'm white and I'm a syndicate soldier

 

EVERLAST
SYNDICATION (REMIX)

 (Wait a minute) 
 
Dope new styles of rhyme, not breakin science 
Down with the Rhyme Syndicate alliance 
You're on the tip but in the crack of a whip 
You know the saying about ships and slips with a lip? 
You'll be sunk while I be gettin drunk 
With the bottle of rose I keep in my trunk, punk 
Don't try to get none, know where I'm comin from? 
I don't care if you do got a gun 
You better step off before I go off 
And don't dare bug, riff or show off 
Cause then I break hard, you think I'm a fanatic 
Speak my rhymes in English, not breakin no mathematics 
Cause that's for other people, boy, I ain't got 'em 
But in almost every other rhyme I can spot 'em 
Get off it, get off the bandwagon 
Runnin the same old styles you keep draggin 
Everlast is here with rhymes ready to drop 
Hey yo, here I go again 
 
I'm the foreman of this rap, this rhyme style construction 
You're on the eve of destruction 
 
(Wait a minute) 
(Keep on singin, keep on singin) (4x) 
 
Step forward face up, meet the grim reaper 
You're aimin for the top as the ladder gets steeper 
To my man Divine I send this dedication 
To let him know that with his help I got a Syndication 
With the dope rhymes I write, the styles I recite 
Don't follow this leader, I'm not your guiding light 
To the groove I'm smooth like a hit from a buddha 
I might smoke an herb but I won't sniff or shoot up 
Not hangin with gangs or messin with thugs 
Not slingin no caine or dealin no drugs 
Cause I'm straight like an arrow, the path I follow is narrow 
On the rise Everlast will sore like a sparrow 
Through the sky, so don't ask me why 
If you're dazed and confused you must be high 
So before you try and break make sure that you're sober 
Cause I'll snatch your crown, boy, then I'll destroy ya 
 
(Wait a minute) 
(Keep on singin, keep on singin) (8x) 
 
To all you new jack MC's writin your rhymes in haste 
Get dissed, put out of business, don't it seem like a race? 
Face death, your final breath jumpin up in my face 
I'm a single not a pair, not a deuce I'm a ace 
As you hear the treble clack hear my bass tone kick 
Take three out in a snap like a flat hat trick 
Everlast is educated, energized for endurance 
Properly protected with a 100 g insurance 
For my mouth (mouth) (mouth) 
Wet my whistle at a party with a Coke and a stout 
Take heed duck MC's cause Everlast has the clout 
So break north, suckers, the top's why I came 
Don't wanna hear beefin, cryin or complainin 
From you or any other party or set 
The pied piper of rhyme, it's time to pay your debt 
Pay the piper, the sniper, who wanna get hyper 
On the microphone there's no other type of 
MC gettin with the E 
Down with Divine and DLC 
Def Lyric Creations on radio stations 
Everlast reigns supreme and I'm in Syndication 
 
(Wait a minute) 
(Keep on singin, keep on singin) (4x) 
 
 
Hey yo, come here, lend me your ear 
Everlast is the name of me and my gear 
So get up, get with it, come on, admit it 
The rhyme I just spoke, you wish you did it 
Like I do and you tried to 
But I'd quit while I'm ahead if I were you 
But I'm not, I'm givin all I got 
Get the girls on the floor, make em hot to trot 
For the Caucasian Sensation there's no hesitation 
Everlast reigns supreme and I'm in Syndication 
 
(Wait a minute) 
(Keep on singin, keep on singin) 
 
(Everlast is here with) 
(Rhymes ready to drop)

 

EVERLAST
THE GREATEST

 (The the, the the, the the, the the) 
 
Don't throw no roses on my grave, boo 
There's not a soldier, it's more like an angel 
You got no where to run, no one to pray to 
Jesus and Moses ain't comin' to save you 
(The greatest, the the the greatest) 
 
I flow like a butterfly, I sting like a hornet 
They won't let me have it 
Not even if no one else want it 
And if I try to take it 
They wanna break me down and strip me naked 
They write a brand new rule and break it 
They lie, they cheat, they steal, they fake it 
 
But I'mma make it, Lord I can take it 
I'm the (The greatest man alive) 
Cut the drama boy, save it for your mama 
I'm the (The greatest man alive) 
I can't sweat it, know I got to get it 
I'm the (The greatest man alive) 
Without no doubt, my name will survive 
(The greatest the the greatest man alive) 
(The greatest man) 
(The greatest, the the) 
 
I'mma make it, Lord I can take it 
I'm the (The greatest man alive) 
Cut the drama boy, save it for your mama 
I'm the (The gratest man alive) 
I can't sweat it, I know I got to get it 
I'm the (The greatest man alive) 
Without no doubt, my name will survive

EVERLAST
THE LETTER

 (Yeah, that's her.) 
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose 
All the broken hearts and the unpaid dues 
What you did to me. What I did to you. 
I ain't mad at you, pooh. So what we gonna do? 
I just seen you out with your new mans, lookin' kinda happy. 
Feelin' like somebody just slapped me. 
My gut's in a knot. My temp's getting' hot. 
I want to make that man bleed and wear this speed knot 
'Cause he ain't got what we had, and it makes me kinda mad. 
I hurt my one true love, just like my dad. 
And it's kinda sad, 'cause now my shit's together. 
No need for umbrellas, I can see the stormy weather. 
I'm goin' outside into the rain. 
And I keep sweatin' cause I can't house this pain 
We was workin' for years, now I'm jerkin' these tears. 
From my lips to God's ears, girl, I did you wrong 
So I'm makin' this song to let you know how I feel 
Before keepin' it real may keep my heart concealed 
And now I'm on the side, just patiently waitin' 
Watchin' on you and the time for updatin'. 
I can't hide from the truth. I know the pudding's in the proof. 
So I stand convicted, like all your friends predicted. 
But I think you'd be surprised knowin' how this ends, brothers. 
We went from lovers to friends, we'll go from friends to lovers. 
So if that man make you smile, I guess that I'll just accept it 
And respect it. 
I'll hit you with this song and let you think about it, 
And then I'll just leave you alone and be a man about it.

THE RHYTHM

 Voice: 
The rhythm is both the songs manicle 
and it's demanicle charge... 
 
The rhythm (20x), 
I'm Everlast born to be a caucassion 
but it makes no difference what persuasion you are 
As long as you know how to get up on the floor 
and start workin' a sweat 
To a musical measure that makes you move 
as soon as the needle drops into the groove 
So get up and dance to the gift I'm giving, 
forget about your troubles get into the rhythm 
 
 
The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (10x)... 
Yo, yo, you know what the world needs? 
Rhythm! 
The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (10x)... 
 
You linger for the rap singer, 
when Donald D brings the party to the deal 
my presence is felt world wide 
You don't dance to this it's suicide 
Put your hands into the air on, the M.C. cop, 
the girlies are pipen' hot 
Natorious Lama is how I'm livin' 
don't step to me step to the rhythm 
Step to the rhythm 
 
The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (10x)... 
You make me feel so hot like I said before we need rhythm, 
The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (5x)... 
All we need is rhythm... 
 
Listen to the tracks that rolls, 
watch the mic as it glows 
The lethal weapon got you trapped in this dance mode 
Ice T's throwin' words at you like dodge ball y'all 
You gotta move get hit, if you get hit, you fall, 
no jokin', no boastin' and no bragging 
Grip the mic like a .44 magnum, 
dust you off if you suck 'cause I ain't 
You want me to write soft rhyme's, 
Sorry, I can't, 
I write the rhythm 
 
The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (10x)... 
We need rhythm for the world to have peace and unity 
We must first have... 
BOOM!

THE WARNING

 This is the warning I warned you baby x3 (sample) 
 
Back of the liqueur store bout' to blaze this joint 
Got some dice in my hand 
My man says six is your point 
Trying to hit the hard way so I can break like Steve Miller 
Take the money then I run son 
I'm a lover and a killer 
 
This is the warning I warned you baby x3 (sample) 
 
I feel like god and the devil 
I'm a saint 
I'm a sinner 
I'm a hard rocking' 
Hard headed 
Hard sick summer winner 
I'm a kush blazing' 
Bush chasing 
Product of the city 
And I ain't asking for your love 
And I don't want your pity 
So girl don't talk about me shitty 
Don't act all high and ditty 
If your man keep playing me funny 
I'mma come take all his money 
And leave him holy from this blessing 
With my four pound smith and Wesson 
Better watch out who you're stressing 
Fuck around you'll learn your lesson 
 
This is the warning I warned you baby x3 (sample) 
 
Back of the liqueur store trying to break these chumps 
Bunch of heads in a circle, daddy's handing out lumps 
Trying to shake these bones 
I'm trying to get these shoes 
But yo they all think Whitey's cheating 
Cause tonight I can't lose. 
They wanna take my funds 
But I'mma blaze my guns 
We're burning sensations 
And heart palpitations 
Why you breathing so heavy 
While your palms are sweaty 
And if you thinking bout' a stick' move 
Word to god you ain't ready 
 
This is the warning I warned you baby x3 (sample)

THIS KIND OF LONELY

 Sittin' alone and I hear rain fallin' on my windowsill 
Just wanna do what's right but I don't know if I ever will 
There's so many reasons, too many excuses 
And all these prescriptions, got too many uses 
And I'm so lonely 
It's kind of scary 
And this kind of lonely is making me weary 
I'm so lonesome I could die 
 
Sittin' alone and I am waitin' for the sun to shine 
Sometimes I kneel and pray hoping someday you'll be mine 
She's so many miles away 
So many things to say 
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway 
Cause I'm so lonely 
The sex is empty 
But this kind of lonely makes it easy to tempt me 
I'm so lonesome I could die 
I'm so lonesome I could die 
 
Sittin' alone and I am waitin' for somebody to call 
Think if I up and died wouldn't nobody notice at all 
Cause I'm so insecure and I feel so unsure 
Can't take it anymore, no 
It's never been like this before 
And I'm so lonely, feel like cryin' 
And this kinda lonely is worse than dyin' 
I'm so lonesome I could die 
I'm so lonesome I could die 
I'm so lonesome I could die

 

EVERLAST
TICKING AWAY

 

 

EVERLAST
TIRED

 Make you go 
Soul for soul over mic control 
Kid, you can't touch me with a ten foot pole 
And I even made the devil sell me his jewels 
He was out to cold mock me and play you for fools, kid 
You know the rules. Must be smokin' super cools 
Tried to diss me on the low got to be a psycho 
That's a'ight though. You know you won't see me shakin' 
I'm 'bout to blow the spot on who's real and who's fakin' 
Who's givin', who's takin', who's livin', who's starvin' 
Diss me on the mike it's time for headstone carvin' 
And epitaph writin'. I'll strike you like lightnin' 
Dissolve you like powder, so turn it up louder 
Go on, pump the wattage, get the cheese by cottage 
I like mean streaks, I like Spanish freaks 
I like Korean barbecue, I like old school beats 
But.. 
 
CHORUS (2x) 
I'm sick of all the shit that's droppin' 
And I'm tired of all the lip that's poppin' 
And all the whack attitudes people coppin' 
I'm only tryin' to get a few heads boppin' 
 
It go bang bang boogie, I'm sick like a loogie 
I'm wiser than Bud. I'm thicker than blood 
I'm older than time, molded from the divine 
How could you be so bold to think that you'll take mine? 
I'm cash like Johnny, it's the highway man 
And I'm walkin' this line the best way I can 
With my farmer's tan and my bloodshot eyes 
I ain't bodied no one, I ain't chopped no pies 
With the budders from the gutters I'm about to explode 
and blow the spot for folk nav up the Gun Hill road 
like artillery shells been from heaven and hell 
and I'm a say a little prayer for every rapper that fell 
'Cause 
 
CHORUS

TODAY (WATCH ME SHINE)

 Yesterday: just a dream I don't remember 
Tomorrow: still a hope I've yet to indulge 
I'm out of time, I'm out of rhyme, I'm out of reason 
Season's change and leave me out in the cold, 
The story's old, the tale been told by many scholar 
Got a fistful of dollar and pocketful of love 
God above if you hear me cryin' 
I've tried to sell my soul but no one's buyin' 
Lord, strike me down now if I'm lyin' 
Bronx Style Bob: Lord strike me down (3x) 
It's gettin' cold It's time for dyin' 
 
CHORUS 
Come on and watch me shine 
Like the world is mine (check it out) today 
Come on and watch me shine (check it out) 
Like the world is mine today 
Watch me shine (check it out) 
 
Let the man who's free from sin 
Bronx Style Bob: free from sin 
Cast the first stone and begin the violence 
Bronx Style Bob: begin the violence 
Let the man whose words ring true 
Speak on up till his voice breaks through the silence 
Bronx Style Bob: through the silence 
Let the ones who lose their way 
Live to see just one more day in the sunshine 
Bronx Style Bob: La la la la la la laaa 
Let the ones who choose to stray 
Recognize the prize they'll pay In their lifetime 
Bronx Style Bob: in their lifetime (2x) 
 
CHORUS 
 
Sittin' you wait for my roads to cross 
You nail me down and you watch me bleed 
Bronx Style Bob: watch me bleed 
So lay my head against the earth 
Plant my body like a seed 
Bronx Style Bob: plant my body like a seed 
You can't always get the things you want, love (check it out) 
Bronx Style Bob: tell me what you want 
Get what you deserve or maybe what you need 
Bronx Style Bob: Uh, tell me what you need 
So fill my hole with precious dirt, love 
Till the soil and part the weed 
 
CHORUS

WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE

 We're all gonna die 
When I was a very young boy, mamma told me we're all gonna die 
Mamma said son love can't be trusted, it's just another weakness 
We're all gonna die 
 
Baby don't cry, praise the most high 
Won't tell you no lie, we all gonna die 
Baby don't cry, praise the most high 
Won't tell you no lie, we all gonna die 
 
Now I'm grown, seen a lot livin', made a few friends 
Gonna get high, hoping I don't take more than I'm given 
Judgement day comin', we all gonna die 
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair 
 
Baby don't cry, praise the most high 
Won't tell you no lie, we all gonna die 
Baby don't cry, praise the most high 
Won't tell you no lie, we all gonna die 
 
Baby getting born, old man dyin' 
Young lady laughin', old woman cryin' 
Leaving like a lamb, comin' back like a lion 
Babylon to Zion, we're all gonna die 
 
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die 
 
When I was a very young boy 
Mama told me, we're all gonna die 
Mama said, son, love can't be trusted 
Its just another weakness, we're all gonna die 
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die 
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair 
 
Baby don't cry, praise the most high 
Won't tell you no lie, we all gonna die 
Baby don't cry, praise the most high 
Won't tell you no lie, we all gonna die 
Baby don't cry, praise the most high 
Won't tell you no lie, we all gonna die 
Baby don't cry, praise the most high 
Won't tell you no lie, we all gonna die

WHAT IT'S LIKE

 We've all seen the man at the liquor store begging for your change 
The hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange 
He asks a man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes 
 Get a job, you fucking slob is all he replies 
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes 
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues. 
 
CHORUS: 
Yeah, then you really might know what it's like (4x) 
 
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love 
He said Don't worry 'bout a thing, Baby Doll, I'm the man you've been dreaming of 
But three months later he say he won't date her or return her calls 
And she swear, God damn, if I find that man, I'm cuttin' off his balls 
And she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door 
They call her a sinner and they call her a killer and they call her a whore 
But God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes 
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose 
 
CHORUS 
 
I've seen a rich man beg 
I've seen a good man sin 
I've seen a tough man cry 
I've seen a loser win 
And a sad man grin 
I heard an honest man lie 
I've seen the good side of bad 
And the down side of up 
And everything between 
I licked the silver spoon 
drank from the golden cup 
Smoked the finest green 
I stroked the baddest dimes 
'least a couple of times 
'fore I broke they heart 
You know where it ends, yo 
It usually depends on where you start 
 
I knew this kid named Max, he used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs 
He liked to hang out late, he liked to get shit faced and keep pace with thugs 
'Til late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head 
Pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead 
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain 
You know it crumbles that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game 
But God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news 
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose 
 
Yeah, then you really might know what it's like (3x) 
To have to lose...

WHITE TRASH BEAUTIFUL

 White Trash Beautiful, Trailer Park Queen 
She slings hash at the diner from 11 to 5 
She married a boy from school, thought he was oh so cool 
But all he can do for money is drive 
Out late haulin' freight on Interstate 5, 
prayin' he'll see home before his baby arrive 
 
White Trash Beautiful, There's something you should know 
My heart belongs to you 
And you coulda found a better guy 
I'll love you till the day I die 
I swear to God it's true 
I'm comin' home to you 
I'm comin' home to you girl 
 
He lights a cigarette, his eyes half open 
He won't be home tonight, but she keeps hopin' 
Drinkin himself to sleep is his only way of copein' 
She waits for him every night, she leaves the front door open 
It's 4 AM and doin 95, 
Tryin to stay awake and make it home alive 
 
White Trash Beautiful, There's something you should know 
My heart belongs to you 
I know you coulda found a better guy 
I'll love you till the day I die 
I swear to God it's true 
I'm comin' home to you 
I'm comin' home to you girl 
 
Her lips say painted red, nametag's crooked 
Her heart's been gone awhile with the truck driving man 
that took it 
He keeps her photograph on his rearview mirror 
She prays for him every night, she hopes that he can hear her 
 
White Trash Beautiful, There's something you should know 
My heart belongs to you girl 
I know you coulda found you some better guy

Bismillah 
Punk rock to ska, disco to blues 
Yo, my blue seude shoes got stepped on 
Slept on, the style that I hustle 
You wanna flex then punk make a muscle 
I'm (Whitey, Whitey)... 
Yeah, that's right 
Some of y'all kiddies wanna act uptight 
Comin' to the party tryin' to spark up fights 
I'm puttin' out lights, boy, 'cause I'm (Whitey, Whitey, Whitey...) 
I'm whiter than crack, I'm harder than drugs 
I'm smarter than thugs, I'm hotter than slugs 
I'm faster than sound, I came to get down, boy, don't fuck around 
You'll catch a beat down it's comin' from

What, you thought I stopped rhymin' 'cause I started singin' 
Pickin' on a six string, wrist bling blingin' 
Name's bell ringin' from coast to coast 
You're rollin' with the one that rocks the most 
I'm (Whitey, Whitey, Whitey...) 
Official like referees, fuck with me put your egos in jeapordy 
Threats to the right, amigos to the left of me 
Part of me's hellish, part of me's heavenly (Whitey, Whitey, Whitey...) 
Boy, that's my name, 
I don't do it for the wealth, I don't do it for the fame 
I do it for the health and I do it for the spirit 
Don't speak the lyric if you can't hear it (Whitey, Whitey, Whitey...) 
If it ain't from the heart than it can't be art 
If you ain't got proof than it can't be truth 
If it ain't got legs than it can not run 
If it ain't never started than it can't be done 
I'm (Whitey, Whitey, Whitey, Whitey, Whitey...)
