YET ANOTHER MOVIE

 One sound, one single sound 
one kiss, one single kiss, 
a face outside the window pane, 
however did it come to this? 
 
A man who ran: a child who cried 
a girl who heard, a voice that lied 
the sun that burned a fiery red 
the vision of an empty bed 
 
The use of forge, he was so tough 
she'll soon submit, she's had enough 
the march of fate, the broken will 
someone is lying very still 
 
He has laughed and he has cried 
he has fought and he has died 
he's just the same as all the rest, 
he's not the worst, he's not the best 
 
And still this ceaseless murmuring, 
the babbling that I brook, 
the seas of faces, eyes upraised 
the empty screen, the vacant look 
 
A man in black on a snow white horse, 
a pointless life has run it's course, 
the red rimmed eyes, the tears still run 
as he fades into the setting sun

YOUNG LUST

 I am just a new boy 
A stranger in this town 
Where are all the good times 
Who's gonna show this stranger around? 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl 
Will some woman in this desert land 
Make me feel like a real man 
Take this rock and roll refugee 
Oooh Babe set me free 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl. 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.

YOUR POSSIBLE PASTS

 They flutter behind you your possible pasts 
some brighteyed and crazy some frightened and lost 
a warning to anyone still in command 
of their possible future to take care 
in derelict sidings the poppies entwine 
with cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time 
 
Do you remember me? how we used to be? 
do you think we should be closer? 
 
She stood in the doorway the ghost of a smile 
haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign 
her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs 
for the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs 
stepping uo boldly one put out his hand 
he said, I was just a child then now I'm only a man 
 
Do you remember me? how we used to be? 
do you think we should be closer? 
 
By the cold and religious we were taken in hand 
shown how to feel good and told to feel bad 
tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray 
now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay 
and strung out behind us the banners and flags 
of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags 
 
Do you remember me? how we used to be? 
do you think we should be closer?
