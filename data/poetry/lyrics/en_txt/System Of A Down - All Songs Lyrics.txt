HIGHWAY SONG

 I need not fear the love 
You love to love the fear 
I never want to be alone 
I've forgotten too 
The road keeps moving the clouds 
The clouds become unreal 
I guess I'll always be at home 
Do you want me to try? 
Directing your night 
 
An exit lights the sky 
The sky becomes complete 
Travelling hearts divine the throne 
I've forgotten too 
Friction, lines, bumps 
the highway song complete 
the signs are all turning right 
 
Do you want me to try? 
Directing your night 
Want me to try 
Directing your LIFE 
 
The furious forms of life 
Our days are never coming back 
The cannons of our time 
Our days are never coming back

Trying to soar by being a whore of life and almost everything 
The sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead but now's a bird 
Able to fly able to die able to break your cursed earth (fuck your mother's earth)

Come to save the Princess Zelda 
Ganon took her away 
Now the children don't play 
But they will when Link saves the day 
Hallelujah! 
 
Now Link, fill up your hearts 
So you can shoot your sword with power 
And when you're feeling all down 
The fairy will come around 
So you'll be brave, and not a sissy coward 
 
Now Link has saved the day 
Put Ganon in his grave 
So now Zelda is free 
And now our hero shall be

From where you see the ships afar, 
From a well trained eye,

If you are the light post, 
Then you own the working class, 
But if you want the answers, 
You better give a piece of ass, 
Give a piece of your ass, 
Warning, 
Post hypnotic suggestions, 
Running the ships ashore, 
The orange light that follows, 
Will soon proclaim itself a god, 
If you point your questions, 
The fog will surely chew you up, 
But if you want the answers, 
You better get ready for the fire, 
Get ready for the fire, 
The ships are multiplying day after day sir, 
And they're coming close to the shore sir, shore sir,
