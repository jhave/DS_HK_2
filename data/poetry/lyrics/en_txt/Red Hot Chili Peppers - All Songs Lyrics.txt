UNDER THE BRIDGE

 Sometimes I feel 
Like I don't have a partner 
Sometimes I feel 
Like my only friend 
Is the city I live in 
The city of angels 
Lonely as I am 
Together we cry 
 
I drive on her streets 
'Cause she's my companion 
I walk through her hills 
'Cause she knows who I am 
She sees my good deeds 
And she kisses me windy 
I never worry 
Now that is a lie 
 
I don't ever want to feel 
Like I did that day 
Take me to the place I love 
Take me all the way 
 
It's hard to believe 
That there's nobody out there 
It's hard to believe 
That I'm all alone 
At least I have her love 
The city she loves me 
Lonely as I am 
Together we cry 
 
I don't ever want to feel 
Like I did that day 
Take me to the place I love 
Take me all that way 
 
Under the bridge downtown 
Is where I drew some blood 
Under the bridge downtown 
I could not get enough 
Under the bridge downtown 
Forgot about my love 
Under the bridge downtown 
I gave my life away

VENICE QUEEN

 Does it go from east to west 
Bodyfree and bodyless 
Come again just to start afresh 
Once again to find a home 
In the moment of the meantime 
 
Dropping in coming through the mess 
Checking in just to get it blessed 
Hard to leave when it's picturesque 
Find a form that's free to roam 
Where you come from 
Where you going 
 
Do it all then it all again 
Make it up and you make a friend 
Paddle on just around the bend 
Find a place where you can see 
All the Mamas and the Papas 
 
Take a chance to recommend 
Hard as hell to comprehend 
Disbelief that I do suspend 
Easy now to find a breeze 
Where you came from 
Where you going 
 
We all want to tell her 
Tell her that we love her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever seen 
We all want to kiss her 
Tell her that we miss her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever seen 
 
I know you said you don't believe 
In God do you still disagree 
Now that it's time for you to leave 
G L O R I A 
Is love my friend 
 
Your stylish mess of silver hair 
A woman of your kind is rare 
Your uniform returns to fur 
G L O R I A 
Is love my friend 
 
And now it's time for you to go 
You taught me most of what I know 
Where would I be without you 
G L O R I A 
is love my friend 
 
I see you standing by the sea 
The waves you made will always be 
A kiss goodbye before you leave 
G L O R I A 
Is love my friend

WALKABOUT

 I think I'll go on a walkabout 
And find out what it's all about 
Just me and my own two feet 
In the heat I've got myself to meet 
A detective of perspective I 
Need to try to get a bigger eye 
I could learn the art of life 
On a walk I could find a wife 
On a walkabout 
 
You could do it in the city 
You could do it in a zone 
You could do it in a dessert 
You could do the unknown 
On a walkabout 
 
High dessert skies are what I spy 
So fly you've got to wonder why 
The stingrays must be fat this year 
Moving slow in my lowest gear 
The digirido original man with a dream 
I believe the Aborigine 
On a walkabout 
 
You could do it with a shuffle 
You could do it with a stroll 
You could do it with a stride 
You could do it all alone 
On a walkabout 
 
I've been sitting far too long 
At home I've got to get along 
A walk could cure most all my blues 
bare feet or in my two shoe 
Bloodwood flowers in my gaze 
Walkabout in a sunny daze 
On a walkabout 
 
I think I'll go on a walkabout 
Find out what it's all about 
Just me and my own two feet 
In the heat I've got myself to meet 
Use your legs to rock it wide 
Take a ride to the other side

Shot from the pages of love and glory 
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story 
Shadow my free form 
A woman that I could keep warm

Sleeping next to you

WARPED

 My tendency 
for dependency 
Is offending me 
It's upending me 
I'm pretending see 
To be strong and free 
From my dependency 
It's warping me 
 
So much love 
So rare to dare 
Afraid of 
Ever being there 
Take me home 
I need repair 
Take me please 
To anywhere 
 
CHORUS: 
Descend 
all the way 
all the way 
Everyday 
Warped 
and scared 
Of 
being 
there 
 
Descended from 
Demented men 
Struggle with 
The art of Zen 
Please don't look 
Too close at me 
You might not like 
What you see 
 
CHORUS 
 
Night craving 
Sends me crawling oh 
Beg for mercy 
Does it show 
A vacancy 
That's full of holes 
Hold me please 
I'm feeling cold 
 
CHORUS

WHAT IT IS

 Give it up to this time full of strife 
Get down, you might be fucking with the song of life 
Extend your deeper senses, there will be no fight 
At the never ending ocean of perfect insights 
'Round your molecule beam with a halo of light 
The animated aura will give delight 
Soon, your every single worry will be out of sight 
 
With the power of It, we are about to astound 
All your preconceptions, they will come unbound 
 Listen very close, my inner voice expounds 
 We are the human race, and we groove to the sound 
Yes, we deliver the truth to our musical birth 
A soul shocking sound with electrify the earth 
People have to know that it's not about money 
Cash is not the way to make your life sunny 
There is no need if you got the soul seed 
Love, life and peace, it can only begin 
When you know in your heart that the change is within 
Love all your brothers and love all your sisters 
Love all the missus and love all the misses 
And don't be shy when you're sharing your kisses 
Greed, jealousy gets boos and hisses 
 
What it is, what it is, so much to be found 
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds 
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song 
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong 
 
Balance your life with the right kind of foods 
To eat a sad cow is to eat another you 
Well, that's an unfair rap, it's unforgivably rude 
It'll put your Karma in the worst of moods 
Someone's drinking booze and taking too many ludes 
'Cause when you cop, don't you cop an attitude 
And that's an ugly thing, it's not the real you 
So please y'all, take some sound advice 
Be yourself, clear your mind, make a sacrifice 
The always sober you is especialy nice 
 
Don't loot, don't shout, give comet the boot 
I love it kickin' back and playin' my bamboo flute 
Refuse to fight wars for political whores 
Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores 
It is my notion that the perfect peace potion 
Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean 
The long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean 
Is the cradle of peace, it's the perfect peace potion 
There you will find it, with sweet sea creatures 
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature 
We will learn much peace will the whale as your teacher 
 Good morning class, how very nice to meet you 
 
What it is, what it is, so much to be found 
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds 
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song 
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong 
 
Open up your hearts to the planets; to the stars 
With your spirit take a trip from Venus to Mars 
You know, Einstein did while Hitler hid 
Now, Albert lives forever in every single kid 
But, with Adolph Hitler, we are permanently rid 
Picasso, Mister Dali and my man, Jimi Hendrix 
These cool brothers make the world go 'round 
Yeah, they do it with art, and Jimy did it with sound 
But, by all these men, it was found 
Each and every person can be just as renowned 
Don't let the world's racist creeds give your pretty face a frown 
Stand up for equal rights, I mean buckle down 
Go spread the word from town to town 
We are the human race and we groove to the sounds 
 
Now that you've heard what it is in a song 
From here on in, you can do not wrong

WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME

 Why don't you love me like you used to do? 
How come you treat me like a worn out shue 
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue 
So why don't you love me like you used to do? 
 
Why don't you spot me like you used to do? 
When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do 
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through 
So why don't you love me like you used to do? 
 
Why don't you be the way you used to be? 
How come you fight so many fights with me 
Somebody changed, so lemme give you a clue 
Why don't you love me like you used to do? 
 
Why don't you say the things you used to say? 
How come you treat me like a piece of clay 
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue 
So why don't you love me like you used to do? 
 
You can't keep a lovin' and a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't know why... 
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths 
 
I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't know why... 
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths 
Take the ball...

YERTLE THE TURTLE

 On a far away island 
of Salamasond 
Yertle the turtle 
Was king of the pond 
A nice little pond 
It was clean it was neat 
The water was warm 
There was plenty to eat 
Until one day 
The king of them all 
Decided the kingdom 
He ruled was too small 
I'm a ruler of all that I see 
But I don't see enough 
And that's the trouble with me 
 
With this stone for a throne 
I am too low down 
I cannot look down 
Upon the places beyond 
So Yertle the turtle king 
Lifted his hand 
And Yertle the turtle king 
Lifted his hand 
He ordered all the turtles 
Onto one another's back 
He piled them high 
Into a ten turtle stack 
I'm Yertle the turtle 
The things I now rule 
I'm king of a cow 
I'm king of a mule 
 
Then down from below 
In the great turtle stack 
Came a burp from a plain 
Little turtle named Mack 
Just part of the throne 
This burpin' little turtle 
Looked up and said I beg 
Your pardon king Yertle 
I've pains in my back 
My shoulders and my knees 
How long must we stand 
Here your majesty 
 Silence ! the king of the 
Turtles barked back 
To the bad burpin' 
Little turtle named Mack 
I'm Yertle the turtle 
Oh marvelous me for 
I am ruler of all that I see 
 
Yertle, Yertle the turtle... 
Yertle, Yertle the turtle...
