 UNDERCOVER

 Hear the screams of Center 42 
Loud enough to bust your brains out 
The opposition's tongue is cut in two 
Keep off the street 'cause you're in danger 
 
One hundred thousand disparus 
Lost in the jails in South America 
Cuddle up baby 
Cuddle up tight 
Cuddle up baby 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover of the night 
 
The sex police are out there on the streets 
Make sure the pass laws are not broken 
The race militia has got itchy fingers 
All the way from New York back to Africa 
 
Cuddle up baby 
Keep it all out of sight 
Cuddle up baby 
Sleep with all out of sight 
Cuddle up baby 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover

Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover of the night 
 
All the young men they've been rounded up 
And sent to camps back in the jungle 
And people whisper people double talk 
And once proud fathers act so humble 
All the young girls they have got the blues 
They're heading on back to Center 42 
 
Keep it undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Keep it undercover 
Keep it all out of sight 
Undercover

Undercover of the night 
 
Down in the bars the girls are painted blue 
Done up in lace, done up in rubber 
The John's are jerky little G.I. Joe's 
On R&R from Cuba and Russia 
The smell of sex, the smell of suicide 
All these things I can't keep inside

 Went out walkin' through the wood the other day 
And the world was a carpet laid before me 
The buds were bursting and the air smelled sweet and strange 
And it seemed about a hundred years ago 
 
Mary and I, we would sit upon a gate 
Just gazin' at some dragon in the sky 
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away 
Well, it seemed about a hundred years ago 
 
Now all my friends are wearing worried smiles 
Living out a dream of what they was 
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up? 
 
Wend out walkin' through the wood the other day 
Can't you see the furrows in my forehead? 
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away 
Now it seems about a hundred years ago 
 
Now if you see me drinkin' bad red wine 
Don't worry 'bout this man that you love 
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up? 
 
You're gonna kiss and say good bye, yeah, I warn you 
You're gonna kiss and say good bye, yeah, I warn you

We walked a steady line 
When all our friends 
Were wavering 
We kept on trying 
 
Now we're always suffering 
Already lost 
Always suffering 
Already lost 
 
Remember when 
On summer days 
I would sing a lovers son 
How you would smile 
Shower me with praise 
And the sun shined on 
 
Now the rain is falling slow 
And the nights grow long 
And the train 
Cries out so hauntingly 
She is gone 
 
Now we're always suffering 
Already lost 
We're always suffering 
Already lost 
 
Please take these flowers 
Smell the perfume 
Let your soul come alive 
Let there be hope 
Hope in your heart 
That our love may revive 
 
For life is but a chance 
On a wind swept hill 
And the seeds of love 
Are swirling above 
Let them be still 
 
But we're always suffering 
We're already lost 
Always suffering 
Already lost

ANYBODY SEEN MY BABY'

 She confessed her love to me 
Then she vanished on the breeze 
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible 
 
She was more than beautiful 
Closer to etherial 
With a kind of down to earth flavor 
 
Close my eyes 
It's three in the afternoon 
Then I realize 
That she's really gone for good 
 
Anybody seen my baby 
Anybody seen her around 
Love has gone and made me blind 
I've looked but I just can't find 
She has gotten lost in the crowd 
 
I was flippin' magazines 
In that place on Mercer Street 
When I thought I spotted her 
 
Getting on a motor bike 
Looking rather lady like 
Didn't she just give me a wave? 
 
Salty tears 
It's three in the afternoon 
Has she disappeared 
Is she really gone for good 
 
Anybody seen my baby 
Anybody seen her around 
If I just close my eyes 
I reach out and touch the prize

 The queen of the Nile 
She laid on her throne 
And she was drifting downstream 
On a barge that was burnished with gold 
Royal purple the sails 
So sweetly perfumed 
And poor Mark Antony's 
Senses were drowned 
And his future was doomed 
 
He was blinded by love 
He was blinded by love 
 
The Philistines paid 
For Samson's blind rage 
The secrets that two lovers share 
Should never have been betrayed 
 
He was blinded by love 
He was blinded by love 
 
Now it's no use crying or weeping 
You better lock up your soul for safe keeping 
Promise me 
 
The poor Prince of Wales 
He gave up his crown 
All for the trivial pursuit of 
A parvenu second hand lady 
So lovers beware 
If you lose your heart 
Careful now, don't lose your mind 
Don't mortgage your soul to a stranger

For maybe just an hour or just a moment 
Of the day 
 
Then blue turns to grey 
And try as you may 
You just don't feel good 
You don't feel alright 
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her 
 
You think you'll have a ball 
And you won't care at all 
You'll find another girl or maybe more 
To pass the time away 
 
Then blue turns to grey 
And try as you may 
You just don't feel good 
You just don't feel alright 
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her 
 
She's not home when you call 
So you can go to all 
The places where she used to go 
But she has gone away 
 
Then blue turns to grey 
And try as you may 
You just don't feel good 
You don't feel alright 
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her 
 
Blue turns to grey (blue turns to grey) 
She has gone away (blue turns to grey) 
I feel so bad (blue turns to grey) 
I wish you'd come on home (blue turns to grey) 
I feel, I feel so down...

 I got a brand new car 
And I like to drive real hard 
I got a brand new car 
And I'm feeling good so far 
 
Take her on the highway for a little spin 
I want to see the kind of shape she's in 
And I got a brand new star 
Jack her up baby, go on, open the hood 
I want to check if her oil smells good 
Mmmm...smells like caviar 
 
Give her some stick 
Push her too far 
Right to the brink 
 
Hear the motor running 
Yeah, she's right in sink 
Tell me if she's thirsty 
Would she like a drink 
And I'm stopping at this bar 
 
Slinky like a panther 
You can hear her purr 
Touch her on the seat 
Go on, feel the fur

BREAK THE SPELL

 In the winter when the cold comes 
And the wind blows with a scornful spite 
And the hard ground feels barren 
And the forest is deathly quiet 
And the whole world lies sleeping 
There's a gypsy all dressed in white 
Put my hand out, ask the question 
Here's the silver, do you have the gift of sight 
 
Can you break the spell 
Can you ring the bell 
Can you break the spell 
It's cold black as night 
I've got a hard heart 
Since we've been apart 
Can you break the spell 
Break it all down tonight 
 
In the springtime when the floods come 
And the earth bursts with the terrible life 
And the sun splash on the windows 
There's a gypsy and he's all dressed in white 
My heart burns with the question 
Can you break the spell 
Still hot as fire 
 
Can you break the spell 
Can you ring the bell 
Can you break the spell 
It's cold black as night 
Cold black as night

We have journeyed far from here 
Armed with bibles make us swear

Please come see me in the citadel 
 
Flags are flying, dollar bills 
Round the heights of concrete hills 
You can see the pinnacles

Please come see me in the citadel 
 
In the streets are many walls 
Hear the peasants come and crawl 
You can hear their lovers call

Please come see me in the citadel 
 
Screaming people fly so fast 
In their shiny metal cars 
Throug the woods of steel and glass

FAR AWAY EYES

 I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield 
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station 
And the preacher said, You know you always have the 
Lord by your side 
 
And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran 
Twenty red lights in his honor 
Thank you Jesus, thank you lord 
 
I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late 
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off 
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find 
Much to my surprise, there she was sittin in the corner 
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear 
Was a girl with far away eyes 
 
So if you're down on your luck 
And you can't harmonize 
Find a girl with far away 
And if you're downright disgusted 
And life ain't worth a dime 
Get a girl with far away eyes 
 
Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do wassend 
Ten dollars to the church of the sacred bleeding heart of Jesus 
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California 
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio 
And all my dreams would come true 
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl 
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got 
 
So if you're down on your luck 
I know you all sympathize 
Find a girl with far away eyes 
And if you're downright disgusted 
And life ain't worth a dime

FORTUNE TELLER

 Went to the fortune teller 
To have my fortune read 
I didn't know what to tell her 
I had a dizzy feeling in my head 
 
Siad she'd take a look at my palm 
She said Son, you feel kinda warm 
And she looked into her crystal ball 
Said You're in love 
 
Said it could not be so 
Not with all the girls I know 
She said when the next one arrives 
Looking into her eyes 
 
I left there in a hurry 
Looking forward to my big surprise 
The next day I discovered 
That the fortune teller told me a lie 
 
I hurried back down to that woman 
As mad as I could be 
I told her I didn't see nobody 
Why'd she make a fool out of me 
 
Then something struck me 
As if it came from up above 
While looking at the fortune teller 
I fell in love

And daylight drabs and nightime witches 
And working girls and blue stockings 
And dance hall babes and body poppers 
And waitresses with broken noses 
Checkout girls striking poses 
And politicians' garish wives 
With alcoholic cunts like knives

Tables turn and now her turn to cry 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Well, I used to walk in the morning, get my breakfast in bed 
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head 
But now she's here and there, with every man in town 
Still trying to take me for that same old clown 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now 
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Standing looking on

 What the hell is going on? 
 
With a blood curdling tally ho 
She charged into the ranks 
And blessed all those grandmas who 
With their dying breaths screamed, Thanks!

Hey, let me go

Hey, let me go

Hey, let me go

This affair is dead as a doornail

The chair is on the table, out the door baby 
 
Baby won't you let me go

LET ME GO

 (M. Jagger/K. Richards) 
You're gonna get it straight from the shoulder 
Can't you see the party's over 
Let me go 
Can't you get it through your thick head 
This affair is finished dead 
Hey, let me go 
I tried giving you the velvet gloves 
I tried giving you the knockout punch 
Hey, let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Let me go 
I find it hard to be cruel 
I find it hard to be cruel 
With a smile, don't you? 
You'll never find that perfect love 
That you read about 
That you dream about 
Maybe I'll become a playboy 
Hang around in gay bars 
And move to the west side of town 
You're gonna get it straight from the shoulder 
Can't you see the party's over 
Hey, let me go 
Let me go 
So you think I'm giving you the brush off 
Well I'm just telling you to shove off 
Hey, let me go 
This ain't no time to waste my breath 
We're going into sudden death

 Lies, dripping off your mouth like dirt 
Lies, lies in every step you walk 
Lies, whispered sweetly in my ear 
Lies, how do I get out of here? 
Why, why you have to be so cruel? 
Lies, lies, lies I ain't such a fool! 
 
Lies, lies in my papa's looks 
Lies, lies in my history books 
Lies, lies like they teach in class 
Lies, lies, lies I catch on way too fast 
Fire, fire upon your wicked tongue 
Lies, lies, lies you're trying to spoil my fun

LIKE A ROLLING STONE

 (B. Dylan) 
Once upon a time you dressed so fine 
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you? 
People'd call, say Beware doll, you're bound to fall 
You thought they were all kiddin' you 
You used to laugh about 
Everybody that was hangin' out 
Now you don't talk so loud 
Now you don't seem so proud 
About having to be scrounging for your next meal 
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be without a home 
Like a complete unknown 
Like a rolling stone? 
You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely 
But you know you only used to get juiced in it 
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street 
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it 
You said you'd never compromise 
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize 
He's not selling any alibis 
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes 
And ask him do you want to make a deal? 
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be on your own 
With no direction home 
Like a complete unknown 
Like a rolling stone 
You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns 
When they all come down and did tricks for you 
You never understood that it ain't no good 
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you 
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat 
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat 
Ain't it hard when you discover that 
He really wasn't where it's at 
After he took from you everything he could steal 
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be on your own 
With no direction home 
Like a complete unknown 
Like a rolling stone? 
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people 
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made 
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things 
But you'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe 
You used to be so amused 
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used 
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse 
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose 
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal 
How does it feel 
How does it feel 
To be on your own 
With no direction home 
Like a complete unknown 
Like a rolling stone?

LOVE IS STRONG

 (M. Jagger/K. Richards) 
Love is strong and you're so sweet 
You make me hard you make me weak 
Love is strong and you're so sweet 
And some day, babe we got to meet 
A glimpse of you was all it took 
A stranger's glance it got me hooked 
And I followed you across the stars 
I looked for you in seedy bars 
What are you scared of, baby 
It's more than just a dream 
I need some time 
We make a beautiful team 
Beautiful team 
Love is strong and you're so sweet 
And some day, babe we got to meet 
Just anywhere out in the park 
Out on the street and in the dark 
I followed you through swirling seas 
Down darkened woods with silent trees 
Your love is strong and your so sweet 
You make me hard you make me weak 
I wait for you until the dawn 
My mind is ripped my heart is torn 
And love is strong and your so sweet 
Your love is bitter it's taken neat

 Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl 
Her eyes were hazel 
And her nose were slightly curved 
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel 
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well 
It took a starry to steal my breath away 
Down on the water front 
Her hair all drenched in spray 
 
Hannah baby was a honey of a girl 
Her eyes were hazel 
And her teeth were slightly curved 
She took my guitar and she began to play 
She sang a song to me 
Stuck right in my brain 
 
You're just a memory of a love 
That used to be 
You're just a memory of a love 
That used to mean so much to me 
 
She got a mind of her own 
And she use it well 
Well she's one of a kind 
She's got a mind 
She got a mind of her own 
And she use it mighty fine 
 
She drove a pick up truck 
Painted green and blue 
The tires were wearing thin 
She turned a mile or two 
When I asked her where she headed for 
 Back up to Boston I'm singing in a bar 
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge 
My nerves are shot already 
The road ain't all that smooth 
Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone 
I keep on a feeling that's gnawing in my bones 
 
You're just a memory of a love 
That used to mean so much to me 
You're just a memory girl 
You're just a sweet memory 
And it used to mean so much to me 
Sha la la la la 
 
She got a mind of her own 
And she use it well 
Mighty fine, she's one of a kind 
 
On the seventh day my eyes were all a glaze 
We've been ten thousand miles 
Been in fifteen states 
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind 
I hit the bottle and hit the sack and cried 
What's all this laughter on the 22nd floor 
It's just some friends of mine 
And they're busting down the door 
Been a lonely night at the Memory Motel

He bites off more than he chews 
Well, well is he ringing your bell

As he stands so aloof 
With an indolent air 
And an insolent stare 
He just shutters the truth 
 
Well, well is he ringing your bell 
My heart is breaking in two 
Well, well he'll be rotting in hell 
For playing the devil with you 
 
It is aready too late 
No point shutting the gate 
Have you already swallowed the bait 
And you're gone 
 
As he knocks you down cold 
As you lose all control 
To this slip of a youth 
I see fire in his eyes 
I see ice in his smile 
And I'm learning the truth 
 
Well, well he's got stories to tell<

To pass through here again 
 
Once I was a rich man and 
Now I am so poor 
But never in my sweet short life 
Have I felt like this before 
 
You heart is like a diamond 
You throw your pearls at swine 
And as I watch you leaving me 
You pack my peace of mind 
 
Our love was like the water 
That splashes on a stone 
Our love is like our music 
Its here, and then its gone 
 
So take me to the airport 
And put me on a plane

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black 
With flowers and my love both never to come back 
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away 
Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day 
 
I look inside myself and see my heart is black 
I see my red door and it has been painted black 
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts 
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black 
 
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue 
I could not foresee this thing happening to you 
 
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun 
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes 
 
I see a red door and I want it painted black 
No colors anymore I want them to turn black 
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes 
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes 
 
Hmm, hmm, hmm,...

Black as night, black as coal 
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky

Between a rock and a hard place 
 
We're in the same boat 
On the same sea 
And we're sailing south 
On the same breeze 
Guiding dream churches 
With silver spires 
And our rogue children 
Are playing loaded dice 
 
Give me truth now 
Don't want no sham 
I'd be hung drawn and quartered for a sheep just as well as a lamb 
 
Stuck between a rock 
And a hard place 
Between a rock and a hard place 
You'd better stop 
Put on a kind face 
Can't you see what you've done to me

ROCKS OFF

 I hear you talking when I'm on the street, 
Your mouth don't move but I can hear you speak. 
What's the matter with the boy? 
He don't come around no more, 
Is he checking out for sure? 
Is he gonna close the door on me? 
 
I'm always hearing voices on the street, 
I want to shout, but I can't hardly speak. 
I was making love last night 
To a dancer friend of mine. 
I can't seem to stay in step, 
'Cause she come ev'ry time that she pirouettes over me. 
 
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming, 
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping. 
 
I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed. 
Plug in, flush out and fire the fuckin' feed. 
Heading for the overload, 
Splattered on the dirty road, 
Kick me like you've kicked before, 
I can't even feel the pain no more. 
 
But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming, 
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping. 
 
Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene. 
Feel so mesmerized all that inside me. 
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me. 
Chasing shadows moonlight mystery. 
Headed for the overload, 
Splattered on the dirty road, 
Kick me like you've kicked before, 
I can't even feel the pain no more. 
 
But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming, 
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping.

 New York was cold and damp 
TV is just a blank 
Looks like another dead end Sunday 
 
What about an early night 
Monday never feels so bright 
Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely 
 
Who wants to brave the pouring rain 
For a glass of French champagne? 
Well grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by 
 
And she was hot as she kissed my mouth 
She was hot as I wiped her brow 
She was hot she pinned me to the ground 
She was quick she knew her way around 
She was hot as she tore my clothes 
She was hot she had no place to go 
She was hot on a cold and rainy night 
 
Detroit was smoky grey 
Nothing like the good old days 
Well I got a fever that I'm fighting 
 
I don't need your company 
Leave me in my misery 
I can take the rebound just like lightning 
 
And she was hot in a 50's dress 
She was hot her lips were flashing red 
I was lost in her burning flesh 
I was hot I was dripping sweat 
She was hot in the Detroit snow 
She was hot she had no place to go 
She was hot on a cold and rainy night 
 
And she was hot and I had the blues 
She was hot honey, where were you? 
If you were in my shoes 
You would be excused 
She was hot you can never wait 
She was hot never hesitate 
She was hot on a cold and rainy night 
 
I think I'm going off the rails 
Riding down the pleasure trails 
I was taking passion where you find it 
 
Honey when you were young and fresh 
And you need the touch of your flesh 
Go take the treasure where you find it 
 
And she was hot in the melted snow 
She was hot in the molten glow 
She was hot she got it in the blood 
She was hot like the dam that bursts 
She was black she was strong and true 
She was black and her eyes were blue 
She was lost and she took a chance 
At just a brief romance 
 
Down the avenue into the lost bayou 
Into the tall bamboo, back to the human zoo 
I wish you all the best, I hope we meet again 
On a cold Chicago night 
 
She was hot 
She was hot 
She was hot hot hot 
She was hot hot hot.........

The sailing is tough, 
I'll get drowned in your love. 
You've got a cut throat crew, 
I'm gonna sink under you, 
I got the bell bottom blues, 
It's gonna be the death of me. 
It's the graveyard watch, 
Running right on the rocks, 
I've taken all of the knocks. 
You ain't giving me no quarter. 
I'd rather drink sea water, 
I wish I'd never had brought you, 
It's gonna be the death of me.

All my confidence sags, 
You got me packing my bags.

Where you are I won't be,

SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL

 (M. Jagger/K. Richards) 
Please allow me to introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
I've been around for a long, long year 
Stole many a man's soul and faith 
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 
Had his moment of doubt and pain 
Made damn sure that Pilate 
Washed his hands and sealed his fate 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game 
I stuck around St. Petersburg 
When I saw it was a time for a change 
Killed the czar and his ministers 
Anastasia screamed in vain 
I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank 
When the blitzkrieg raged 
And the bodies stank 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah 
Ah, what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah 
I watched with glee 
While your kings and queens 
Fought for ten decades 
For the gods they made 
I shouted out, 
 Who killed the Kennedys? 
When after all 
It was you and me 
Let me please introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
And I laid traps for troubadours 
Who get killed before they reached Bombay 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's confusing you 
Is just the nature of my game 
Just as every cop is a criminal 
And all the sinners saints 
As heads is tails 
Just call me Lucifer 
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 
So if you meet me 
Have some courtesy 
Have some sympathy, and some taste 
Use all your well learned politesse 
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah

Don't say hi, like a spider to a fly 
Jump right ahead and you're dead 
 
Sit up, fed up, low down go round 
Down to the bar at the place I'm at 
Sitting drinking, supereficially thinking 
About the rinsed out blonde on my left 
Then I said, hi like a spider to a fly 
Remebering what my little girl said 
 
She was common, flirty, she looked about thirty 
I would have run away but I was on my own 
She told me later she's a machine operator 
She said she liked the way I held the microphone 
I said my, my, like the spider to the fly

TIE YOU UP (THE PAINT OF LOVE)

 You're deaf to it, blind to it 
It's like a thunderclap 
Feel the prickles running 
Up and down your back 
Why so divine, the pain of love 
 
You have to work at it, stay with it 
Pay for it, bust your ass 
Lie for it, cheat for it 
Forget about your past 
Why so divine, the pain of love 
 
You dream of it passionate 
You get a rise from it 
Feel the hot cum 
Dripping on your thighs from it 
Why why so divine, the pain of love 
 
Sometimes you crave for it, cry for it 
Women will die for it 
Looking back, cut the crap 
Was it really worth the rap? 
It's hard to survive the pain of love 
 
Ooh I need a time out 
Time to make my mind up 
Substitute a line out 
I'll be back next season with a bang 
 
No release from the jail 
No parole, no bail 
Hard labor, fifty lashes 
Hard labor, money splashes 
It's hard to survive the pain of love 
 
The old maid is roughing up 
Applying final touches 
Even though she's late for the dance 
I tell you tonight she's really gonna have a ball 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up 
She's gonna really tie me up

Don't hurt me, don't hurt me 
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me 
 
Why so divine the pain of love 
That's what they call it: the pain of love 
Tie me up, tie me up, tie me up, tie me up 
 
Why do divine, the pain of love

head. Put the rest of her body in the refrigerator, ate her 
piece by piece. Put her in the refrigerator, put her in the

scared there's a bloke running around with a fucking chain 
saw. Oh oh no, gonna, oh no. Don't saw off me leg, don't saw 
off me arm. When I get to the movies, you know I'd like to 
see something more romantic, you know. Like 'An Officer and a 
Gentleman' or something. Something you can take the wife to, 
you know what I mean?

 When your spine is cracking and your hands, they shake, 
Heart is bursting and you butt's gonna break. 
Your woman's cussing, you can hear her scream, 
You feel like murder in the first degree. 
Ain't nobody slowing down no way, 
Ev'rybody's stepping on their accelerator, 
Don't matter where you are, 
Ev'rybody's gonna need a ventilator. 
When you're trapped and circled with no second chances, 
Your code of living is your gun in hand. 
We can't be browed by beating, we can't be cowed by words, 
Messed by cheating, ain't gonna ever learn. 
Ev'rybody walking 'round, 
Ev'rybody trying to step on their Creator. 
Don't matter where you are, ev'rybody, ev'rybody gonna 
Need some kind of ventilator, some kind of ventilator. 
What you gonna do about it, what you gonna do? 
What you conna do about it, what you gonna do? 
Gonna fight it, gonna fight it?
