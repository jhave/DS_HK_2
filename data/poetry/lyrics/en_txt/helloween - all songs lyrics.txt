A GAME WE SHOULDN'T PLAY

 Do you believe in fate or chances 
Design or coincidences 
Would you say that all the people 
Live their life for good and evil 
Some have reached the end of patience 
Start to play with God's creation 
 
They know you 
Control you 
In a game we shouldn't play 
Corrupt your heart 
And make you part 
Of a game we shouldn't play 
We run blind 
In a game we shouldn't play 
Its all a game we shouldn't play 
 
If we shall die now it will happen 
If we're good we'll come to heaven 
If we shall live it will be so 
End your life and you'll see limbo 
All is fixed and predetermined 
Only time will stretch new sins 
 
He loves you 
Alarms you 
Of a game we shouldn't play 
He tells your heart 
To stay apart 
From a game we shouldn't play 
We run blind 
In a game we shouldn't play 
Its that kind of game we shouldn't play 
 
Manipulations on the genes 
Nuclear contaminated seeds 
Clone of the clone in the breeder's zone 
Its a game 
A game we shouldn't play 
We run blind 
In a game we shouldn't play 
Its that kind of game we shouldn't play

 

HELLOWEEN
A HANDFUL OF PAIN

 I still remember every hour 
Every second has been ours 
Far away from any burden 
We met eyes without a curtain 
Headless into a new sensation 
Wether brain nor fear or patience 
Careless we had a game to play 
You crossed my way for twenty days 
Why don't you just heal 
The yearning that I feel? 
Hey, what we called a game 
Is more than just a handful of pain 
We go the wrong ways 
Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain 
We go the wrong ways 
Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain 
 
We're different colours, different nature 
Both we were like pupil and teacher 
It's a puzzle with two pieces 
Still not done 'cause one still misses 
Helpless I go through unknown stages 
A chapter of life which has missing pages 
Torture's not only physical 
It painds unbound 
Way, way down 
Why don't you just heal 
The yearning that I feel? 
Hey, what we called a game 
Is more than just a handful of pain 
We go the wrong ways 
Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain 
We go the wrong ways 
Cause I believe it's more than just a handful of pain

A LITTLE TIME

 Higher 
It's what I expect from my life 
It's like a wire 
That holds me back down to the ground 
 
Oh, I hear you say 
 That is the way of the world 
No, hear what I say 
 I wanna do so much in my way 
Higher 
I've set my limits and bounds 
There's a fire 
It's burning so hot in my head 
 
Oh, I hear you say 
 That is the way of the world 
No, hear what I say 
 I wanna do so much in my way 
 
[Chorus] 
We got 
A little time to build up our lives 
A little time to make up our minds 
A little time to fill up our dreams 
A little time, time

A MILLION TO ONE

 Born into somewhere unseen and unknown 
Just like a wonder so small and alone 
Take me away into your innocent dreams 
Maybe I'd see what it all means 
 
A million to one 
You will lose it all 
A million to one 
You'll be falling 
Down to where I am 
An unholy man 
A million to one 
You'll be falling 
 
It's so sad and so true but what can I do 
Only a few years then it's up to you 
To care for yourself, I hope I gave good advice 
For all your life, how to survive 
 
A million to one 
You will lose it all 
A million to one 
You'll be falling 
Down to where I am 
An unholy man 
A million to one 
You'll be falling

A TALE THAT WASN'T RIGHT

 Here I stand all alone 
Have my mind turned to stone 
Have my heart filled up with ice

I won't have no sleep tonight

In my heart, in my soul 
I really hate to pay this toll 
Should be strong, young and bold

And let's say it's just alright 
You won't sleep alone tonight

AIN'T GOT NOTHIN BETTER

 I'm always on the run with my guitar and my old shoes 
I'm movin' and I'm groovin' and I really got the blues 
I'm always havin' fun and I've got nothin' left to lose 
I never tune my guitar 'cause I like the way it grooves 
 
Sitting in a sleazy bar I'm slowly goin' down 
I ain't got no more money but I know you'll be around 
Early in the morning and the first kiss isn't far 
I ain't got nothing better than my girl and my guitar 
 
We're rockin' and we're rolling and we don't know what we do 
We play so loud and out of tune I need a new tattoo 
We don't give a damn shit we five horsemen on the run 
We only wanna go out there and have a lot of fun 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Take me through the night and I will always be with you 
Feel me, touch me, hear me, yes I love the things we do 
Love me and I show you just the way I love you too 
We belong together and I never let you go

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 
Tomorrow I'll miss you 
Remember I'll always be true 
And then while I'm away 
I'll write home everyday 
And I'll send all my loving to you 
 
I'll pretend that I'm kissing 
The lips I am missing 
And hope that my dreams 
Will come true 
And then while I'm away 
I'll write home every day 
And send all my loving to you 
 
All my loving, I will send to you 
All my loving, darling I'll be true 
 
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 
Tomorrow I'll miss you 
Remember I'll always be true 
And then while I'm away 
I'll write home everyday 
And I'll send all my loving to you

ALL OVER THE NATIONS

 I keep wondering all these days 
How to thrive the way we stray 
A year, a lifetime parted, together 
will be all the same 
Many things to make me sad 
Some can even drive me mad 
Just fear forever 
No more endevours 
Leave me where I stand 
 
You are here 
And make me feel so high 
Day by day 
Something one can't deny 
Lets give each other certainty 
All over the nations the tunes come alive 
Winners and losers, we're all alike 
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery 
We all fade into one 
 
Don't you feel too hypnotized 
Or keep your future jeopardized 
So whats accomplished crying for nothing? 
Skip depression now 
 
Come, arise and take me higher 
No more lies, and every soul can see 
We're incarnate sincerety 
All over the nations the tunes come alive 
Winners and losers, we're all alike 
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery 
We all fade into one 
 
All over the nations the tunes come alive 
Winners and losers, we're all alike 
No matter as truth ain't some great mystery 
We all fade into one

ANYTHING MY MAMA DON'T LIKE

 I'm no believer 
I just listen to my own head 
I'm no believer 
I just call you liar instead 
Keep all your sorrows 
Words might be pathetically vain 
Life is a fire 
Light it and you can read your name 
 
I'm the king of the night generation 
I'm anything my mama don't like 
I'm a slave of perverted nation 
Anything my mama don't like 
 
I am a flyer 
Rising in the wake of my dreams 
I am a tumbler 
Life can be as good as it seems 
 
I'm a child playing chess with tomorrow 
I'm anything my mama don't like 
I'm a clown and I beg, steal and borrow 
Anything my mama don't like 
 
I'm the king of the night generation 
I'm anything my mama don't like 
I'm a slave of perverted nation 
Anything my mama don't like

BACK AGAINST THE WALL

 Can you see now where I stand, my friend 
Will you offer me your helping hand 
And will you cross the void and speak your little words 
Rush, I'm beggin' you, it hurts 
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts 
 
I'm standing back against the wall 
Dare I to move I got to fall 
My heart is blinded by the light 
I close my eyes forever 
 
May not turn left, may not turn right 
I sense a gap to every side 
I'm standing back against the wall 
Back against the wall 
 
Get back! 
Get back! 
 
I can hear it coming closer now 
Blaring silence of the dark below 
Under my feet I feel it slide like sand 
A frequent crushing down again, again, again and again 
 
I'm standing back against the wall 
Dare I to move I got to fall 
My heart is blinded by the light 
I close my eyes forever 
 
May not turn left, may not turn right 
I sense a gap to every side 
I'm standing back against the wall 
Back against the wall 
 
Will you cross the void of pride 
Then speak the words 
Rush, I'm beggin' you, it hurts 
It hurts, it hurts, yes it hurts 
 
I'm standing back against the wall 
Dare I to move I got to fall 
My heart is blinded by the light 
I close my eyes forever 
 
May not turn left, may not turn right 
I sense a gap to every side 
I'm standing back against the wall 
Back against the wall 
 
Get back! 
Back against the wall 
Get back!

BACK ON THE GROUND

 We can race over the mountains 
Sail over the spheres 
We can ride under the oceans 
But we can't fight our fear 
 
Something's wrong with the world these days 
Do you know what it is? 
 
We believe to govern nature 
Find ways to lenghten our life 
And we go through digital stages 
Still the children cry 
 
Something's wrong with the world these days 
Do you know what it is? 
The planet could be a better place 
If we spot the miss 
But I guess I would see a start 
And I will sing it loud 
WON'T YOU PUT YOUR FEET BACK ON THE GROUND 
 
We explore the existence of aliens 
Try to conquer space 
We refine nuclear science 
Still to die in the haze 
 
Something's wrong with the world these days 
Do you know what it is? 
The planet could be a better place 
If we spot the miss 
But I guess I would see a start 
I warn you without doubt 
WON'T YOU PUT YOUR FEET BACK ON THE GROUND

BACK ON THE STREETS

 I've been told in the name of something 
I've got to know what it means to play the game 
 
Too many faces around they're talking 
They play their parts oh, so well but who's to blame 
 
Back on the streets, that's where we are 
Building a fortress of power, yeah! We're coming 
 
You know better than me the rules are: 
Getting better or fat in the mania 
 
It's good to know who is who in our game 
The speed is faster, it's harder to see where we are 
 
Back on the streets. . . 
 
Please Mister Know how just bring me the news 
I'm waiting so long for you telling me all you can tell 
 
There's one thing about you, you're dying to prove 
The master plan is yours and living with knowledge is hell

 Come take a look up to the constellations 
Take the book of God you will find your relations 
If you understand you will know the solution 
Things will fall back to the new constitution

I'm the last of the seven troopers 
And I came here for the 7th war

The blaster of the gods 
And I have seen it all before 
Before the war 
Cold hearted earth 
I'm the master of the universe 
And I have seen it all before 
Before the war 
 
Nature sets a limit on your millenary 
Turning every place into a cruel mean scenary 
All will get a chance to shun the holy file 
But you will be few getting under the wire

 I put my money in the suitcase 
And headed for the big race 
I felt a chill on my backbone 
As I hung up the telephone 
 
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat 
Running down the back of my neck 
To lose means trouble, to win pays double 
And I got me a heavy bet 
 
Cold, cold sweat 
 
They say chances on the outside 
Are looking very slim 
I've been so lucky on the inside 
I feel I'm going to win 
 
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat 
Running down the back of my neck 
Take a little money, there's nothing left to lose 
And I got me a heavy bet 
 
Cold, cold sweat 
 
I've got me a whole month's wages 
I haven't seen that much in ages 
I might spend it in stages 
And move out to Las Vegas 
 
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat 
Running down the back of my neck 
To lose means trouble, to win means double 
And I got me a heavy bet

 My little crazy cat took a train to meet his gang downtown. 
They played Black Jack<fritz played his false game too far. 
A guy got up and started a gunfight. 
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day, 
Don't waste time, cute runaway, you cute runaway, 
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town. 
Addicted to chicks, he's got a rental tree near the nudist beach. 
Oh, watch out ! Booze and ladies are his fate. 
Too much sex and food and Rock'n'Roll. 
He's looking for trouble day by day, for trouble, day by day, 
Don't waste time, cute runaway, you cute runaway, 
He kept being taken by sunrise, my stray in town.

Makin' an end to all this terror and pain

The chains will be broken by all slaves on earth

Forever to be free from their load

CUT IN THE MIDDLE

 Ice cold Metalmonster creeping 
Through the darkest night 
Heart of gold and steel 
Because I don't know what to write 
Pins and chains and bullet bells round my metal chest 
All that shit looks good on me even if I'm getting fat 
 
Squeeze my ass into leather pants 
It needs to be so tight 
Tons of beer and alcohol 
It brings me through the night 
 
Cut in the middle 
Couldn't hurt me too bad if I weren't here 
Can someone tell me what it's all supposed to mean 
The answer isn't really clear 
 
In a world of lines and pills that where I wanna be 
Look at me I am dangerous I lost reality 
I look into the mirror babe, I tell you what I see 
Is my awful crabface really dirty smiling at me 
 
And sometimes I feel so down and depressed and 
What I do is to remember all the past 
And my best friend will be the IOU 
 
Cut in the middle 
Couldn't hurt me too bad if I weren't here 
Can someone tell me what it's all supposed to mean 
The answer isn't really clear

DELIVER US FROM TEMPTATION

 A priest caught in lust 
Is roaming the red light 
Pays to indulge his sins 
Body cry 
Each day he awakes 
And prays for forgiveness 
 Our Father , he cries to his God 
 Set me free 
Once we may ask for forgiveness 
Someday we could see paradise 
His words echo to his disciples 
Yet again he'll give in to his vice 
Caught and bound by temptation 
So ashamed of running free 
Sweet embrace, captivation 
Carnal truth against out beliefs 
Deliver us 
Deliver us 
His suit hides the truth 
His business is pushing 
Supplying the kings of the street 
Rich man's pride 
Higher than high, a kid passing by 
Blows off his head and escapes 
Outta sight outta sight 
Who finds the road to redemption 
The preacher, the kid, or the man 
Who will decide it, I wonder 
Vicious circle entangled and trapped 
Caught and bound by temptation 
So ashamed of running free 
Sweet embrace, captivation 
Carnal truth against our beliefs 
Deliver us 
Deliver us 
Once we may ask for forgiveness 
Someday we could see paradise 
His words echo to his disciples 
Yet again he'll give in to his vice 
Caught and bound by temptation 
So ashamed of running free 
Sweet embrace, captivation 
Carnal truth against our beliefs 
Deliver us 
Deliver us 
Deliver us 
Deliver us

DO YOU FEEL GOOD

 When we were lovers you called me names 
But time goes on and you were gone 
I got told you you're a big shot for the ties 
And take it from behind 
 
Now you took a new flat in a different town 
And rumors are you're wealthy now 
For that high class dress shows you earn well 
Where strangers come and go 
 
Do you feel good, do you feel fine 
Did you achieve what you had in mind 
Do you live cool, not too confined 
What can you tell this old heart of mine 
 
Some busty companion claims to know you well 
Does night shift at some place somewhere 
Said there's no one who has fun your way 
In Moscow, Rome, LA 
 
I wish, I knew... 
Jolly understand... 
...and you never call 
 
Do you feel good, do you feel fine 
Did you achieve what you had in mind 
Do you live cool, not too confined 
What can you tell this old heart of mine 
 
Well I got no objections 
I'm old enough, you know 
But it's weird this night I seem to know you 
Better than before 
 
Do you feel good, do you feel fine 
Did you achieve what you had in mind 
Do you live cool, not too confined 
What can you tell this old heart of mine

 You hide, won't fight 
Avoid the daylight 
Give in, won't win

Why don't you stop crying 
Stop your painful dying 
Why don't you give your life a sense 
 
One game, one aim 
But you're always sleeping 
One light so bright 
In darkness you're creeping 
 
Why don't you use your head 
Step out of your warm bed 
And stop being on anxious rat 
 
Run for your destination 
Fly to the sun 
Don't give a damn what the people may say 
It's like a chain on your leg 
When you always look back 
If you don't risk anything one day you'll pay 
 
Don't run for cover 
Don't cry alone 
Make a step on your stairway 
One step closer to what you live for 
Don't run for cover 
Don't throw away 
The only chance that you got 
To be the fire in a hot life you choose 
 
No pride, no right ? 
In your heart is more strength 
You know, I know 
Your destiny's in your hand 
 
Now you have this time 
To survive don't be blind 
In this world where so many can't see 
 
Try to catch the key 
Make that you can see

 Every lie will win a prize 
Love sold by a whore 
Calculated sacrifice 
Death without a war 
Aftermath and alibies 
Straw doll chess to please the poor 
 
Don't tell me of any wonders shitting gold 
Don't tell me of a hard way we have to go through 
Still we pay your warmth out of the cold 
Do you really think we're that blind? 
Don't spit on my mind

Has a black sheep part 
But the brave will never know 
What the black sheeps start 
In the name of country love 
they enrich themselves apart

EXCLUSIVE HELLOWEEN INTERVIEW

 [Kiske:] 
 
Well, Japan. We've been there, I think, two times now, and it's always been 
a great fun playing there. I like the venues. They are sounding very 
good, 
they look very good, and kids over there really appreciate good music and 
stuff. And I think the next time we're gonna play at the Budokan, which 
is 
pretty cool. Lookin' forward to it. It's gonna be fun. 
 
[Schwichtenberg:] 
 
Japan has been always great to play there, and will be in the future. And 
Japan people are great, it's fun to play there and you feel very 
confident 
and convinient or whatever to play there. And Japanese people are listening 
very carefully, I don't know. It's great to be in Japan. 
 
[Kiske:] 
 
 Kids of the Century is the first life sign of us after two and a half 
years. And after all those rumours going around about this band me 
leaving the band, me splitting up, or the band splitting up, and all that 
stuff, which has been quite a lot. Maybe that's normal when the band's not 
on the scene for a while. But after that it feels really good to have, 
actually, a new album ready and a single out. So the kids know we are still 
there. And with the music you can prove what you can do still even 
without 
one guy that just left the band. I think we found the right person there, 
Roland. And I think the album says everything. Yeah, I wrote Kids of the 
Century about more than two years ago now. And remembering that time I 
feel like, when I wrote that song, I was in that feel of that all the kids 
today, they just feel like they haven't got anything to do with the 
problems. Everything goes wrong, the nature or whatever. Just came out of 
that feeling actually. And that's what the song's all about, I think. What 
the kids today...Because I feel like everybody's responsible, especially 
the kids. If they don't feel like they have to change anything or have to 
make things better, nobody will. 
 
[Schwichtenberg:] 
 
I think having Roland in the band is.. we are as lucky as we have Michael 
in the band by that time, we are lucky having Roland in the band. And he's 
just doing great songs and great guitar work he's doing. And a good pal as 
well. He's a nice fellow. And he just fits in the band very much. I think 
the fans will accept him of course. 
 
[Weikath:] 
 
Well, the nice thing about Roland being in the band is that I saw him 
like, I don't know, fifteen years ago or so on stage, and I thought that 
was pretty impressing, what he did there, and I could never forget about 
that. And that's why actually I called him up then when we needed 
another 
guitarist, Remember that guy? . And so it took me, like, four hours to 
find out the number, like I had to phone up musicians I knew and suddenly 
somehow I got the number, and phoned him up: You might not know me, but I 
know you. How about playing guitar in Helloween? And he didn't even know 
the band. So I had to give him some examples of our songs, like really 
loud, cranked it up. And so, well, he was interested, like it quite a lot. 
And then we went to rehearsing, we had to do the whole stuff within two 
months. 'Cause then we had to go on an American tour and Japan meant two 
hours of playing. And well, ha ha, quite a tough job I would say. After 
all, I mean, we can handle that, we are pretty good, you know. And I'm 
sorry about that, but well... yeah, Roland is a very nice guy. He's 
doing a big part of the band with his character, and his kind of being. 
And it's quite a difference too how the whole thing worked before, because 
he is a completely different character. He is a lot more calm and very 
critical. He's always got his own opinion and that's exactly what we need. 
 
[Kiske:] 
 
Yeah, we recorded the album at PUK studio in Denmark, which is a very 
good 
studio, I think, very lovely place. It's right in the middle of nowhere 
but that's actually what we wanted, to really concentrate on the album. 
And working with Chris was pretty cool, because he's got a very strong 
sense of humor as we like it. And we had some cool moments there and 
that's all caught on the album. Yeah, the production that Chris 
Tsangarides has done is right in your face. That's the best description 
of the sound actually. So just check it out! 
 
[Schwichtenberg:] 
 
Crystal clear, or... 
 
[Kiske:] 
 
Crystal Tsangarides clear, ha ha! 
 
[Weikath:] 
 
I would say thank you to everybody who kept up the faith during all that 
time, and after all, those rumours are untrue. 
 
[Schwichtenberg:] 
 
The best thing for the fans, for the people who like us, is just to listen 
what comes from us directly, like this now, and the album of course. 
 
[Kiske:] 
 
Yeah, especially the album. 
 
[Schwichtenberg:] 
 
Don't trust any rumours or whatever. 
 
[Kiske:] 
 
The thing is, forget about what's been in the magazines, or what has been 
said, or all the stuff. And just check out the album and you know what's 
going on. Of course, the single as well. 
 
[Schwichtenberg:] 
 
Thanks for keeping the faith

FAITH HEALER

 [Alex Harvey] 
 
If your body's feeling bad 
And it's the only one you have 
You want to take away the pain 
Go out walking in the rain 
You watch the flowers go to bed 
Ask the man inside your head 
Your spirit never has to grieve 
All you've got to do's believe 
The faith healer, the faith healer 
 
All you've got to do is feel 
Your body's going to start to heal 
The fingertips of holy fire, 
Everlasting sweet desire 
It never mattered 
What the doctor said 
The healer man will sail away 
It's immortality for two, 
Oh the miracles 
They will come to you 
From faith healer,the faith healer 
Can I put my hands on you? 
Can I put my hands on you? 
 
Faith, and hope, and charity, 
The simple relativity 
He can make you understand 
All you've got to take his hand 
Remember somebody said 
Ask the man inside your head 
The fingertips of holy fire, 
Everlasting sweet desire 
The faith healer, the faith healer! 
Can I put my hands on you? 
Can I put my hands on you? 
Let me put my hands on you? 
Let me put my hands on you? 
Can I put my hands on you? 
Can I put my hands on you? 
The faith healer, the faith healer...

FALLING HIGHER

 I thought that I felt alright with my world 
But now what I knew seems taken by someone 
Probing me, waiting if I take the bait 
Surrender, step into the line 
 
We won't give into the false 
We are not as dull as taken 
some will hold out if they can 
They must kill us if they want us to fall 
 
When we unite 
We're falling higher 
When worlds collide 
We'll stand straight in turmoil and fear 
No harm coming near 
 
Hungry forever since we took a glance 
Feared that the world was taken by someone 
We realized by the look in your eyes 
Metal will never die 
 
With magic in our hands 
We are lost and found contenders 
For a kingdom of our stand 
Come together no surrender at all 
 
[SOLO] 
 
With magic in our hands 
We are lost and found contenders

No harm coming near 
No harm coming near 
No harm coming near 
We're falling higher

FAR AWAY

 We are gifted to be scared 
We need stacks of weapons to survive 
Marching for religious reasons 
Marching on and on to save our lives 
 
When will it have an end 
How can we live in harmony 
How can I understand the way things gonna be 
 
Take me far away and set my spirit higher 
Take me far away and set my soul on fire 
And I pretend to understand 
Whatever comes I'll be there for you 
 
Genetically influenced 
Is our harvest how far can we go 
Someday my own clone will come 
Take away my wife how could I know 
 
Sometimes I feel so sad 
Sometimes I could just go insane 
But when I see your smile it makes me strong again 
 
Take me far away and set my spirit higher 
Take me far away and set my soul on fire 
And I pretend to understand 
Whatever comes I'll be there for you

FAST AS A SHARK

 [Accept Cover] 
 
Fog in the streets 
A church clock beats 
Midnight darkness all around 
 
You better beware 
You better take care 
Be prepared for the shock 
 
The time has come 
And he's the one 
Who's breathing down your neck 
 
Coming from behind 
Now it's your time 
A loser will die 
 
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark 
He's a killer he'll rip out your heart 
On a one way track and you're not coming back 
Because the killer is on the attack 
 
Surprise attack 
Coming from the back 
An expert of the deadly knack 
 
Just take care 
Just beware 
Be prepared for the fight 
 
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark 
He's a killer he'll rip out your heart 
On a one way track and you're not coming back 
Because the killer is on the attack 
 
Watch out watch out 
 
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark 
He's a killer he'll rip out your heart 
On a one way track and you're not coming back 
Because the killer is on the attack 
 
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark 
He's a killer he'll rip out your heart 
On a one way track and you're not coming back 
Because the killer's 
Because the killer's 
Because the killer's on the attack

 Will you first time... Will it be... I think of someone like me ? 
Makes me wonder,I can show you'd neverthought you'd see. 
You're like sunshine,I can feel your heat is drying out my brain, 
Would you feel like... like we're having fun it Ican do the rain ? 
Have you thought out your dreams, do you have some ? 
Let's see if we can find some more. 
Give me your fancies at random,I think we can deal with them all. 
I can't wait forever, baby, open me your door, 
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more. 
I can see you standing there, you know you're worth the try, 
Let me guide you in my spaceship and I'll surely make you have 
A R e a l G o o d T i m e . 
Don't waste time now you are soaking wet, so fix the things you got, 
Guess you know how and when you're done I dotta see you strut. 
My desire can I watch you rock and know which one of choose ? 
I'm no liar I could take you down and you got nothing to lose. 
I don't know any better occasion, can't hold back, it's the end of the day 
I don't think you're here for the first time, no problem with me anyway. 
I can't wait forever, baby, open me you door, 
I just want your loving if you cannot give me more. 
I can see you standing there, you know we have a try, 
I can feel this night is special and I surely make you have

Tomorrow I'll still be crying 
How could you hide your lies 
Your lies 
 
Here I am 
Seeing you once again 
My mind's so far away 
My heart's so close to stay 
Too proud to fight 
I'm walking back into night 
Will I ever find someone to believe?

FROM OUT OF NOWHERE

 [Faith no More] 
 
Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm 
You splash me with beauty 
And pull me down 
You come from out of nowhere 
My glance turns to a stare 
 
Obesession rules me, 
I'm yours from the start 
I know you see me, our eyes interlock 
You come from out of nowhere 
My glance turns to a stare 
 
One minute here 
And one minute there 
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry 
One minute here 
And one minute there 
And then you wave goodbye... 
 
Sifting to the bottom, 
Every day for two 
All energy funnels, all becomes you 
You come from out of nowhere 
My glance turns to a stare 
 
One minute here 
And one minute there 
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry 
One minute here 
And one minute there 
And it hurts inside 
One minute here 
And one minute there 
And then you wave goodbye...

GET ME OUT OF HERE

 I can't tell you how it happened 
So I guess we'll never know 
I'm always late and running out of time 
So I must be very slow 
 
Someone must have smoked too much 
Or is it only dust 
My pals just tend to leave here in disgust 
 
My flat is a mess same as ever before 
My suits they stink like you don't wanna know 
Junk to the left, trash to the right 
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore 
 
When the postman rings I stay in bed 
I never make it down 
My fridge must be alive inside 
It's uttering funny sounds 
If I don't know what time it is 
I peek out if there's sun 
No use anyway, my money's gone 
 
Get me out of here I can't take it anymore

Ever since we paid for selling our lives. 
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland, 
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again. 
Deprived of our consciousness, we can't predict what's more, 
Can you remember how things used to be before ? 
I secretly dream of things we will be taught, 
Will someone esteem for those who have fought ? 
Someday, someway, I may see a wonderland, 
Don't you, won't you say that we'll be free again.

 You think I could be the one to look inside your mind 
I don't think we'll have the time, so let us get in line 
 
Another town another bed, another thing to go 
By now I learned to take it cool, but I don't wanna know 
 
My head is empty, all the stories that I've known I've told 
The situation I escaped from, now it looks like gold 
 
Anyway and anyhow we did it, it was good 
But now I take the time to think 'bout ev'rything I should 
 
'Cause after this I'm gone, the show is done 
No other town or bed that lies ahead 
I'll go home to what I know 
I'll go home, home to you 
 
By the time that you think 'bout it twice no spotlight makes you stay 
By the time that you feel you don't know, you have to go

The plane is ready in my head, so many things to do 
A few more hours till it's over I reach out for you

Until the next time I'll be so much better, yes I know 
 
Now this is it I'm gone, the show is done

 We're living in our units 
And one thing we can do is 
Work for a life without a fate 
 
We don't pay any taxes 
But the state is the axes 
Of our minds without love without hate 
 
We have a higher order 
No one needs to be a hoarder 
Our society is such a glorious thing 
 
In our centers we can dream of 
Anything you never think of 
You can't say we are puppets on a string 
 
Our minds are kept so clean 
Checked up on a screen 
They're holy men, they're saints 
Without them we might all fail 
 
We don't know war and crime 
Things of ancient times 
We just see it if we put on video 
 
The blue pass is for my life 
And the red one's for my wife 
It's the only thing we really need to show 
 
There are still some without rules 
But I tell you, they're all fools 
The Guardians will find them as we've seen 
 
We got banks where we freeze them 
They get new brains screwed in then 
And act contrarily to what they have been 
 
With new minds made so clean 
Checked up on a screen 
They will be the saints 
Without them we might all fail

Protect security

Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind 
I'll be leaving the hands of doom 
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands 
To be free and not trapped anymore

Ride the sky, Ride the sky 
Give me wings to fly, Ride the sky 
 
I have to think for myself and then act 
In conformity of my own thoughts 
No one should tell me what's wrong and what's right 
Why don't you leave me alone 
Set me free, set me free

Trick or treat they have to choice, 
Little ghost's are makin'lotsa noise

There's something going on 
No way to escape the power unknown 
In the streets on Halloween

Make your choice, it's hell or paradice 
Ah It's Halloween 
Ah It's Halloween...tonight! 
 
Someone's sitting in a field, 
Never giving yield 
Sittinh there with gleaminf eyes, 
Wating for big pumpkin to arise 
Bad luck if you get a stone, 
Like the good old Charlie Brown 
You think Linus could be right 
The kids will sy it's just a stupid lie

 [Scorpions] 
 
I saw it walkin' lonely down the street 
Cool like the cat, like a crazy dream 
I looked twice again, I can't believe 
It turned around right then 
And looked at me 
I said oh no, it really couldn't be 
It was a man, it was a woman, too 
 
He's a woman, she's a man 
He's a woman, she's a (woman) 
 
I think it really came from far away 
I'm feeling head uptight 
So I have to stay 
It takes my hand and says 
 Come on, let's go! 
We're going home, 
She asked me to stay 
He starts to move, she starts to play 
I need a body, why not you 
 
He's a woman, she's a man 
He's a woman, she's a (woman)

HEAVY METAL (IS THE LAW)

 Fight hard 
Live fast 
Play loud 
Step out of the crowd 
 
Iron 
Rulin' 
Steel bent 
Forever the faith will live on in our hearts 
 
There's nothing else in all the world 
That will bring it down 
We will play our wildest step to all around 
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood 
 
Power 
Burnin' 
Brains out 
United metallians ready to strike 
 
White heat 
Red hot 
Mayhem 
If you don't feel it you won't understand 
 
There's nothing else in all the world 
That will bring it down 
We will play our wildest step to all around 
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood

Heavy Metal is the law that keeps us all united free 
A law that shatters earth and hell 
Heavy Metal can't be beaten by any dynasty

HEAVY METAL HAMSTERS

 There are some fellows soft and mellow 
Sitting in the field and play like hell 
No one knows the way it goes 
But all the songs they play they sound so well 
 
Tonight we go to see the Heavy Metal Hamsters 
It must feel nice to be a Heavy Metal Hamster 
Nothing sets you free like our Heavy Metal Hamsters 
 
A 20th century Fox came by 
A gold tipped cigarette high in his jaws 
contracts, PDs, Nose Bags, TV shows 
And everything with no remorse 
 
Things are settled now for our Heavy Metal Hamsters 
Fame up to your brows, oh Heavy Metal Hamster 
A previously unknown lifestyle Heavy Metal Hamster 
 
The sweet taste of success is strong 
And everything inside goes wrong you see 
With coloured furs, sunglasses 
Tons of nuts to eat, they don't feel free 
 
What is wrong with our Heavy Metal Hamster? 
Look what they have done our Heavy Metal Hamsters 
Where is the field to run for our Heavy Metal Hamsters 
Some things are left undone for our Heavy Metal Hamsters

HELL WAS MADE IN HEAVEN

 There was a time eating your mind 
Eating your heart and your soul 
Down to the bone always alone 
Nobody waiting at home 
 
Now allow that we unite our fires 
Shout it out 
Give yourself to me 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 
Hell was made in heaven 
I was made for you 
Hell was made in heaven 
Made for loving you in sin 
 
Ten years ago you made the vow 
Promised your life and your love 
Before you have paid, nothing returned 
What is enough is enough 
 
Now allow that we unite our fires 
Shout it out 
Give yourself to me 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 
Hell was made in heaven 
I was made for you 
Hell was made in heaven 
Made for loving you in sin 
 
Now allow that we unite our fires

Pleasure or pain 
Cold or fire 
Love against disdain 
Hope or dipair 
Truth or liar

Do you know wat to choose?

No left without right 
 
Hey lord, hey lord 
Life is striking as you taught 
Hey lord, hey lord 
Time is running, time is short 
Hey lord (What is it all about?) 
 
Good or profane 
Odd or even 
All is face to face 
Sinner and saint 
Serve each other 
Life is called this place 
Do you know what to choose? 
It can't happen you lose

No left without right

HOW MANY TEARS

 A lot of things occur each day 
We've got to live with on our way 
There's so much misery on the screen 
With commercials in between 
 
And the Russians won't be so late 
Uncle Sam don't wanna wait 
No matter if you're black or white 
You never ever had a right 
 
And look up to the eternal skies 
See warfare even there 
What once has been a paradise 
Now destruction and despair 
 
In other worlds the children die 
Lacking food ill from a fly 
Oppressed by troops to tame their land 
It's all the same again 
 
If any man is free on earth 
Then tormentors steal his birth 
They slam gun butts in his face 
And leave his woman choked in mace 
 
So stand up for our human rights 
Push back this pest of hate 
Raise you voice pass on the light 
Unite! it's not too late 
 
[Chorus] 
How many tears flow away 
To become a sea of fears 
How many hearts are torn apart 
Till another torment starts 
 
But before the world 
Turns into a sun 
All cruelty and violence 
On earth will be dead and gone

I BELIEVE

 Give me two strong arms to fight my enemies, 
Give me two eyes to see the truth. 
Give me two legs I think I have to run, 
And fill my heart with faith that I won't lose. 
I don't wanna lose ... 
Give me one real love that I don't freeze out there, 
Make me feel your presence in the night. 
Give me one strong heart that tells me when I lie, 
And take my soul so I won't have to hide. 
I don't wanna hide ... 
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall, 
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do I believe. 
I Believe ... I Believe ... 
[Solo: Roland Grapow and Michael Weikath] 
It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall, 
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do ... 
There'll be no reason to live without you giving me light, 
There is so much that you give, your love is shining so bright. 
I Believe ... I Believe ... I Believe ... Believe ... 
I wanna love but I always hate I wanna give but I always take. 
Want you to laugh but I make you cry, maybe I won't change 'til I die. 
It's so much easier said than done I know I can't just always run. 
Got so much anger inside of me, I understand but I think I see what I'm not. 
I know it's true what J.C. said I got it all clear in my head. 
Seens we were born to be unfair, 
I am a sinner that's starting to dare ... to Believe. 
Give me your hand until the end and I will waik into promised land. 
I don't deserve anything you do but I can't stop loving you. 
No more lies, no false religions, 
No more whys and wrong God missions. 
No shiny T.V. priests begging to cash, 
No more wars that no God's ever asked for. 
There's a way back out of here one day we're going home, 
Tell everyone who wants to hear whatever you do ... do Believe. 
I Believe ... We Believe ... Believe ... Oh !

I DON'T CARE YOU DON'T CARE

 You took me up and you took me down 
You managed not to make me frown 
I met some dogs, they looked me down 
And said: You're not her only man in town 
 
Don't you beleive that I feel blue 
'Cos I know the ones who act the way you do 
You kinda ones will always stay the way you are 
But I don't care, you don't care, we don't care 
Shit happens let it happen 
 
My sister drove my Bentley home 
And found she wasn't all alone 
She led him in and thought she'd won 
He took the car and now he's gone 
 
Don't you believe that I feel blue 
There's other thoughts and other things to do 
Tho sometimes I think bad luck is going a little 
Too far 
 
But I don't care

I DON'T WANNA CRY NO MORE

 Hey, brother, I miss you so you knoked on heaven's door, 
And we won't see you anymore it must be crazy what we're living for. 
'Cause God's stopped keeping you on the ladder of you life, 
I call your name with tears in my eyes. 
I don't wanna cry no more past gave me happiness and gain 
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance, 
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul. 
I don't wanna cry no more we're still missing you. 
Life's like a walking on a high wire, 
You slipped away, I've seen you dying in vein. 
High as mountains seem all the problems that I have, 
But when I hear your voice far away out of the dark 
You just go on and on in the back of my mind. 
I don't wanna cry no more past gave me happiness and gain 
Life is fleeting like aflower from a distance, 
After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul. 
I don't wanna cry no more we're still missing you. 
Skin and bone won't touch the sky, 
I hope you'll find passage out of the dark. 
To the otherside of the sea and I know that I'll see you again.

 Alright 
I remember the day that we met 
I needed someone you needed someone too 
Spent time taking all you could get 
Even yourself was one thing you never could do 
You played with my heart 
You played with my head 
I've got to laugh when I think all things you said 
 
Cause I stole your love 
Stole your love 
Ain't never going to let you go 
I stole your love 
Stole your love 
 
You never stop running around 
You pick me up and say you want some of me 
Down 
You were the girl that nobody could own 
You stay for a while and then you would leave me alone 
But I'm something different ain't like the rest 
How does it feel to find out your failing your test 
 
Cause I stole your love 
Stole your love 
Ain't never going to let you go 
I stole your love 
Stole your love

Listen! 
Cause I stole your love 
Stole your love 
Ain't never going to let you go

but they're all convinced that 
they're the ones to see 
 
So they keep talking and they never stop 
and at certains point you give it up 
so the owly thing that's left to think is this 
 
I want out... To live my life alone 
I want out... Leave me be 
I want out... To do things on my own 
I want out... To live my life and to be free 
 
People tell me A and B 
they tell me how I have to see 
Things that I have seen already clear 
so they push me then from side to side 
they're pushing me from black to white 
they're pushing'til there's nothing more to hear 
 
But don't push ne to the maximium 
shut your mounth and take it home 
'cause I decide the way things gonna be 
 
I want out... To live my life alone 
I want out... Leave me be 
I want out... To do things on my own 
I want out... To live my life and to be free 
 
there's a million ways to see the things in life 
a million ways to be the fool 
in the end of it, none of us is right 
sometimes we need to be alone 
 
I want out... To live my life alone 
I want out... Leave me be 
I want out... To do things on my own 
I want out... To live my life and to be free

I'M DOIN' FINE CRAZY MAN

 Thunder, flash and lightening is working on my back 
The tables in the kitchen are tryin' to break my neck 
 
All the late night memories are leaning in my shoes 
My mother's old grey leather gloves are singing loud the blues 
 
I can taste what's in the sun 
No time to waste 'cause there is none 
When I feel blue I see it shine 
But still it's true I'm doin' fine 
 
You can't see me 'cause now I'm all free 
Now you know I'm through 
And all that's not new 
 
Sitting on a paperback 'cause I don't know what really cracks 
I'm tryin' to climb my pencil to get high 
 
No one tells me what to do 'cause no one knows what I've been through 
You don't know a thing but you can learn 
 
It's time to touch the sky 
My mind is free I fly 
 
I can taste

 

HELLOWEEN
IF I COULD FLY

 No fear, no pain 
Nobody left to blame 
I'll try alone 
Make destiny my own 
I learn to free my mind 
Myself I now must find 
Once more 
Once more 
 
If I could fly 
Like the king of the sky 
Could not tumble nor fall 
I would picture it all 
If I could fly 
See the world through my eyes 
Would not stumble nor fail 
To the heavens I sail 
If I could fly 
 
So here I am 
In solitude I stand 
I've got dreams inside 
I need to realize 
My faith has grown 
No fear of the unknown 
No more 
No more 
 
If I could fly 
Like the king of the sky 
Could not tumble nor fall 
I would picture it all 
If I could fly 
See the world through my eyes 
Would not stumble nor fail 
I could ravage my jail 
If I could fly

 

HELLOWEEN
IF I KNEW

 Loneliness seems like an evil dream 
But reality is life and life is here 
Once my heart was ruled by emptiness 
Harmed because of being too sincere 
 
But now that you've crossed my way 
Could it be we found it again 
 
If I knew that I'm your only one 
I could live and make it through time 
But if one day you'd just be gone 
I wouldn't know how to ever get by 
 
How can I make you feel secure 
We're both the same, I'm king and you are queen 
Understand you make me breathe again 
Tell me all your thoughts and I will see 
 
Take my hand and we'll be there 
Together, someday, somewhere 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Repeat Chorus] 
 
I wouldn't know how to ever get by 
I wouldn't know how to ever get by 
I would simply break down and cry

 Tell me, pretty girl, do you know who I am? 
Have you ever seen me as your friend? 
Anything we have is those hungry nights 
But there's so much left unsatisfied 
All those little things you told me 
Ain't good enough to show me 
That we're gonna make it through the time 
 
I found out 
In the middle of a heartbeat 
And I know that I'm doin' right

IN THE NIGHT

 In the night I'm calling you be my guide, help me through, 
In the night i call your name you're the light in times of shame. 
The songs I sing, all my love I bring for you. 
I always try to makethings better, everything that has gone wrong, 
Mighty plans in the right direction but very little has been done. 
Everyday when I try to get forward I find myself another mile back, 
Help me fighting, help me breathing why am I falling down instead ? 
Every useful minute seems to be the thoughtof you, 
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do. 
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but it's true. 
In the night I'm calling you be my guide, help me through, 
In the night i call your name you're the light in times of shame. 
The songs I sing, all my love I bring for you. 
[Acoustic Solo: Roland Grapow] 
Free from ourselves and free form this world we may find, 
The freedom we search ,'cause all that we need is inside. 
The hours we waste we may not get back for a while, 
And when it gets dark no chance will be there for atry. 
When I wake up early in the morning I catch abook and jump inside, 
I fill my head with a million wonders and try to fill the night with light. 
The moment when I get things clearer I see another mountain to climb. 
And always when I think I'm nearer I realize there is no time. 
In the night I'm calling you be my guide, help me through, 
In the night i call your name you're the light in times of shame. 
Sometimes I cried after all Ilied to you.

[W:] Well, hello there Well, actually this is my place. Now just 
come in and let's sit down over there. 
[J:] Yeah but weren't we going to do photographs as well? 
 
[W:] You mean uh well what's the big deal? Let's just go for it. 
[J:] Well, it's just that it's a bit bloody smokey in here. I can't see 
a thing. 
 
[W:] Oh, alright we can open a window. We might get rid of the 
smell as well I guess. 
 
[J:] Ah, hey your English is coming along pretty good. Its not 
bad. 
 
[W:] Oh, oh yeah. thank you, thanks. But I know much people 
say that. 
 
[J:] Ah, um, Is this me? Can we get started now or are we just 
gonna fuckin keep talking like this? 
 
[W:] Right but please, before, let me play a little piece to you. 
It's a new track I wrote. It's inspired by Kiss you know. You 
know Kiss? They got that track called Rock'n Roll All Night 
and so I thought I'd do one called Rock 'n' Roll All Day . Am 
I not ingeniously? 
 
[J:] Well I suppose so but don't you think we should get. 
 
[W:] You know I thought it could become real smashing hit. I 
think it's great! Hey come over here and I'll play it to you. 
 
[J:] No, listen, listen a minute, listen would you like to get. 
 
[W:] No wait. listen, this is the intro. Now that's the intro. Now 
you listen Ha ha. 
 
[W:] Oh, I sung it, I sung it my own cause it's more original. Great 
huh? 
 
[J:] No, no, no, no, It's quite interesting but come on. 
 
[W:] Oh wait, just listen. 
 
[J:] Urghh! 
 
[W:] Cool! 
 
[J:] Yes Michael but don't you think we have to. 
 
[W:] Wait, here comes to the chorus coming right up. This as 
we say in German will be a milestone in Gemman rock history. 
Here the chorus. There, there it goes. 
 
[J:] Michael! Michael! I'm sorry but it s not really.. 
 
[W:] What. what. OK Stop! 
 
[J:] Michael, Michael don't you think we should um.. 
 
[W:] Oh wait wait, wait, wait. I'll wind it a bit ahead you know, 
and I'll play you the solo part and because it's the best solo I 
ever played, you know. 
 
[J:] Jesus, God damn it! I really don't think that we have the time 
to do this. 
 
[W:] Um, OK, OK. You will hear it anyway, a thousand times 
when its a, when it s a hit! You'll, You'll hear it on every radio 
station and on video! Well how do you like it, it's a great track 
isn it and I like the Iyrics 'cause I wrote them and they're quite 
rock 'n roll huh? 
 
[J:] Well actually Michael, I'm really sorry but I don't really like 
it. It's not really. 
 
[W:] Well, maybe you didn't listen properly I could maybe 
change the lyrics here or there, but it s really Kiss! 
 
[J:] No, No. 
 
[W:] Listen, I'll play it to you once more and then you'll admit 
that it's really. No? 
 
[J:] No, Not at all. Just look. I don't care how many times you 
play this crap to me, it still sucks! 
 
[W:] Oh? 
 
[J:] And anyway, I mean, oh Jesus, I'm gonna go away and 
interview Roland. I mean, Jesus, what a bunch of fuckin' 
bullocks. 
 
[J:] What a fuckin' bunch of bullocks! 
 
[W:] Um, well so, what's wrong with him? Maybe next time I 
should do it with someone from Kerrang

Judas I am not a Jesus Christ 
Judas you will be the one who's crucified

JUGGERNAUT

 [Frank Marino] 
 
Evolution, revolution 
Are the parents of one another 
Moving ever moving crushing 
Everything that gets in its way 
Smiles telling lies about the future 
I don't wat to believe them 
Pity on their faces baby 
Don't you think they laugh 
In your face 
Wheels of justice they have fallen off 
Man's on crutches 
Being kicked like dogs 
It's a jugernaut 
It's a jugernaut 
It's a jugernaut 
 
Politician's makin' money all the time 
They murder our freedom 
Filling up their pockets 
While the people in the street 
Lay and die 
Man you're workin' hard as hell 
You only end up paying more taxes 
Give 'em all your money baby 
Don't you think they give you a bomb 
Lambs were slaughtered 
For the sacrafice 
Man's now offered up by his own kind 
 
Cry for your soul 
Young and old 
Help your own 
They will need it, heed it 
Don't be caught between the stones 
 
Economic pressure and recession 
In a nation of madness 
Living under fear of countries 
Launching up a nuclear attack 
Men are killing men with paper bullets 
You may wonder how that's done 
Money is the bullet 
And the dirty greedy heart is the gun 
 
It's a jugernaut 
It's a jugernaut 
It's a jugernaut 
Rise or fall 
One and all 
Sink or swim 
We can win 
Oh how we can do it if we try 
 
Superpowers playing chess 
Along a board with people as pieces 
Taking human life 
Just like they're only 
Sacrificing a pawn 
Don't you know the game is rigged 
The best that they will do 
Is a stalemate 
Who will be the judge of what is right 
When we are lying in graves 
We'll inherit from all of our nations 
Not peace, only deadly radiation 
 
It's a jugernaut 
It's a jugernaut 
It's a jugernaut

JUST A LITTLE SIGN

 Here I stand alone again 
Hundreds all around (hundreds all around) 
Didn't come here to make a friend 
But to listen to the sound (listen to the sound) 
 
Something's growing in my plans 
As she looks into my eyes 
Now I smile the whole damn night 
But my dream acts cold as ice 
 
It's time for just a little sign 
It's time, make believe the world is mine 
It's time for just a little sign 
It's time, make believe the world is mine 
Just a little sign 
 
Shouldn't I dare to talk to her 
But what is it I would say (is it I would say) 
Surely I'd look like a clown 
For my smiles freeze on my face 
 
It's time for just a little sign 
It's time, make believe the world is mine 
It's time for just a little sign 
It's time, make believe the world is mine 
Just a little sign 
 
It's time for just a little sign 
It's time, make believe the world is mine 
 
It's time for just a little sign 
It's time, make believe the world is mine 
It's time for just a little sign 
It's time, make believe the world is mine 
Just a little sign 
Just a little sign

We burn down the paradise 
 
We're stoppin' good waves 
We're losin' our trees 
The future looks bright ahead 
I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies 
 
We're lost in this time we create so fine 
The future we already fear 
Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt 
The future looks bright ahead 
 
We're the kids of the century we're lost in our games 
No time for the memories we look in the haze 
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault 
Ev'rything's done mum, we fall 
Let's keep on crying 
But sometimes I don't wanna fall 
 
Ev'rytime when you look around things will smile at you 
Ev'rytime when you turn around you smell the truth 
But you run away from the lies you can't say 
Don't run away from the lies you can't say

Fact is that I'm here I'm the master of reality

So many ways to go 
Before we're sanctified 
Few will be chosen ones 
Until we fade and die 
 
Kings will be kings 
Pawns will be pawns 
Aeons of tears 
Wild and severe 
Blessed be the young 
Strong enough to bear 
What before long 
Will come, Will be, might never disappear 
 
I know that pride's before the fall 
How can I fall if there's none left at all 
Tell me tell me 
How far can one fall from down below? 
 
It's either time or ev'ryone round 
To show us what or who might be exchangable

LAY ALL YOUR LOVE ON ME

 [Abba] 
 
I wasn't jealous 
Before we met 
Now every man I see 
Is a potential threat 
And I'm possessive 
It isn't nice 
You've heard me saying 
That smoking was my only vice 
But now it isn't true 
Now everything is new 
And all I've learned 
Has overturned 
I beg of you 
Don't go wasting your emotion 
Lay all your love on me 
 
It was like shooting 
A sitting duck 
A little smalltalk 
A smile and baby 
I was stuck 
I still don't know 
What you've done with me 
A grown up man should 
Never fall so easily 
I feel a kind of fear 
When I don't have you near 
Unsatisfied 
I skip my pride 
I beg you dear 
 
Don't go wasting your emotion 
Lay all your love on me 
Don't go wasting your emotion 
Lay all your love on me 
 
I've had a few 
Little love affairs 
They didn't last very long 
And they've been pretty scarce 
I used to think 
That was sensible 
It makes the truth 
Even more incomprehensible 
'Cause everything is new 
And everything is you 
And all I've learned 
Has overturned 
What can I do 
 
Don't go wasting your emotion 
Lay all your love on me

LIAR

 As a dancer she's undercover 
Won the Big Don to be her lover 
Had to make him tell her his secrets 
About his buiseness and about his street rats 
 
She had to become his trustful right hand 
The burean needed the files with his brand 
She really was a damn good actress 
Everybody called her 'Big Don's Mistress' 
 
Oh, it's just a show 
Put on for love 
How could he know 
 
Liar, liar 
Sweet desire 
Liar, liar 
Who are you 
 
She sent the messages thru her office 
The Don reckoned he will face a judas 
So he told her of a damned deceiver 
Secured, in her he was a strong believer 
 
He confessed to her being sick of all this 
How he suffered in the deepest abyss 
But saw in her the wish for a new life 
To escape from there and make her his wife 
 
No, not just a show 
Put on for love 
How could he know 
 
Liar, liar 
Sweet desire 
Liar, liar 
Who are you 
 
Liar, liar 
Play with fire 
Liar, liar 
Learn the truth 
 
It had turned somehow 
She had not seen how 
Felt the bullet still flying 
Straight went into her heart 
Tore her old world apart 
Now to live on she first had to die 
 
There's a reason to live 
There's a reason to live and let die 
There's a reason to give 
There's a reason to give in a lie 
 
Liar, liar 
Sweet desire 
Liar, liar 
Learn the truth 
 
Liar, liar 
Sweet desire 
Liar, liar 
Who are you 
 
Liar, liar 
Play with fire 
Liar, liar 
You learned your truth now

LOCOMOTIVE BREATH

In the shuffling madness 
Of the locomotive breath 
Runs the all time loser 
Headlong to his death 
And he feels the piston scraping 
Steam breaking on his brow 
Old Charlie stole the handle 
And the train, it won't stop going 
No way to slow down, oh 
 
He sees his children jumping off 
At stations one by one 
His woman and his best friend 
In bed and having fun 
And oh, he's crawling down the corridor 
On his hands and knees 
Old Charlie stole the handle 
And the train, it won't stop going 
No way to slow down, oh 
No way to slow down 
 
He hears the silence howling 
When he catches angels as they fall 
And the all time winner 
Has got him by the balls 
Oh, and he picks up Gideon's Bible 
And it's open at page one 
I think God, he stole the handle 
And the train, it won't stop going 
 
No way to slow down 
No way to slow down 
No way to slow down 
No way to slow down

LONGING

 Feelings come and go I've never known, 
Something longs to grow won't let go. 
Spirits around my head are whispering, 
I turn inside instead of wondering. 
Deep inside of me I know there's got to be, 
A different kind of truth that sets the spirit free. 
If I don't wanna know what's written inside me, 
How could I see anything how could I be anything ? 
Restless minds have searched long before, 
The truth will be same for evermore. 
The mightiness of trees that you can feel, 
Can give you all you need just listen still. 
Here is love and there is pain. 
It's all around, it's all the same, 
There's nothing new that I cuold tell to you. 
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts, 
We might not know the mining yet, but I am sure we can't reject 
The truth that is in everything that is and has been and will be. 
There is a long way to go there is a high place to know, 
There is a world to go through but there's so much more to do 
Until we're home ! 
Deep inside of me I know there's got to be, 
A different kind of truth that sets the spirit free. 
If I don't wanna know what's written inside me, 
How could I see anything how could I be anything ? 
Feelings come and go I've never known...

MADNESS OF THE CROWDS

 Sightless the one who relys on promise 
Blind he who follows the path of vows 
Deaf he who tolerates words of deception 
But they who fathom the truth bellow 
Shout! Shout!The madness of the crowds hail insane 
The madness of the game 
Guilty the one with his silent knowledge 
Exploiting innocence for himself 
Dangerous he whom our faith was given 
Broad is the road leading straight to hell 
Shout! Shout!The madness of the crowds hail insane 
The madness of the game 
Dangerous he whom our faith was given 
Broad is the road leading straight to hell 
Shout! Shout!The madness of the crowds hail insane 
The madness of the game

MANKIND

 Here is all mankind so proud of their achievements 
There is a stone that is warmer than you 
 
Look how we stand in the stream of illusions 
No one says a word 
 
Here you laugh and there you cry 
All that makes you move 
 
There's no fear for anything 
Anything but you 
 
Animals dying for our vanity 
Our world is a beautiful place to be free 
 
Drinking the blood of the weak, it's so easy 
No one hears them cry 
 
Here you cheat and there you lie 
All that makes you gain 
 
One day we will face His throne 
There's nothin' we can say 
 
Prosperity, luxury, fast food is rising 
It's the rainforest that dies 
 
Here you laugh and there you cry 
All that makes you move 
 
Here you cheat and there you lie 
All that makes you gain

 Fool moon standing in the streets 
I know the time is near 
Incarnate power roaring from the sky 
Unrelenting forces blasting through the air 
Roaring thunder lift your hands and pray 
 
Running through the empty streets they're looking for the fight 
Swords gleam in the light of moon the gods prepare to strike 
 
[Chorus] 
Metal invaders, ready to strike 
A warning from hell, be careful tonight 
 
Dark night overwhelming bright light 
See the demons fly 
Can't trust your senses fear you'll have to die 
Super mighty shadows casting amplitudes to ears 
Sounds you've never heard that take you high 
 
Time has come for them to rise, invasion is their doom 
Riding high on iron horses in the light of moon 
 
[Chorus] 
Metal invaders, the gods on their ride 
Sworn to bring metal, mayhem tonight

MIDNIGHT SUN

 Tried so hard to understand all of your feelings 
Tried to cope with your insanities 
Come to think about too many ways of healing 
What we lost or maybe never had 
 
One small step into the hidden decoy 
One more word is help and one will destroy 
 
I woke up in the midninght sun 
So aware damage has been done 
Agony or sanctuary 
Only fate will show the way 
 
From the bright of day into the jaw of darkness 
 
One is shoved, a victim of a lie 
Friendly face turns into a fiery grimace 
Suddenly feelings learn to die 
 
Used up sympathy no chance to return 
To a world one knew but wounds that will burn 
 
Spent more time in the midnight sun 
Still aware of what else has gone 
Agonized and hypnotized 
When will I be shown the way 
 
Fell asleep and no midnight sun 
Still aware justice has bee done 
No more doubts but disbelief 
When the night was day 
Celebration, miracle 
And fate did show the way

MISSION MOTHERLAND

 So far from our system we came here through space 
To leave poisoned spheres for your race 
Our knowledge we trade for the time shared on earth 
To take and give for what it's worth 
 
On, our screens we've been shown your world 
Plead for your welcome, you won't get hurt 
 
Mission motherland 
Another chance 
With sunlit soil and air to breathe 
Is there any place for us to live 
To grow descendants 
To be free 
 
You gave us resources 
You gave us advice 
To deal with the unknown to get humanized 
We've shown you dimensions and brought you on ways 
You've never seen yesterday 
 
Hand in hand we will march through time 
So much more to research and find 
 
Mission motherland 
Another chance 
With sunlit soil and air to breathe 
Is there any place for us to live 
To grow descendants 
To be free 
 
When you hear these words 
We've taken cold refuge 
In freezers to keep us alive 
What we didn't know 
Your central star called sun 
Sends lethal rays to earth 
Say how many of us died 
In the streams of light 
Faceless bodies, morbid cries 
Doomed our colonies 
Wake us when you've healed the world 
Save our souls 
 
When will we be as one again 
And fulfill what we understand as

MUSIC

 When I was a young boy I had no aim, 
Neither experience it wasn't a shame. 
Most of the time it satisfied me, 
But some day I realized music is like a rising sun. 
Times are now changing and memory fades, 
I gaze at the photos, a look in the haze. 
You cannot imagine how many friends I've lost, 
It's much too late for calling them back. 
Music is like sunrise for me, 
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine. 
Music is like sunrise for me it's like coming home. 
I was always insecure, sometimes I still am, 
But I made up my mind now and look here I stand. 
I ask myself sometimes: Is it all worth it ? 
To fly over mountains makes you fall down again 
But music is like sunrise for me, 
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine. 
Music is like sunrise for me it's like coming home. 
[Solo: Roland Grapow and Michael Weikath] 
Music is like sunrise for me, 
It's joyful like a trip in a time machine. 
Music is like sunrise for me it's like coming home

NEVER BE A STAR

 No matter how big we are 
We dream of home 
The place where we all belong 
Therefore this sing 
 
We are who we are 
We'll never be a star 
We are where we are 
But we'll never be a star 
 
No time to see all our friends 
There where we are 
Ten thousand miles are quite long 
And much too far 
 
We are who we are 
We'll never be a star 
We are where we are 
But we'll never be a star (a star) no 
 
We are who we are 
We are who we are 
We are who we are 
We are who we are 
 
We are who we are 
Never be a star 
We are who we are 
Never be a star 
 
We are who we are 
We'll never be a star 
We are where we are 
But we'll never be a star, never be (a star) 
 
We are who we are 
We'll never be a star (never be a star) 
We are where we are 
But we'll never be a star (never be a star) 
 
We are who we are 
We'll never be a star (never be a star) 
We are where we are 
But we'll never be a star, never be 
 
We are who we are 
We'll never be a star 
We are where we are 
But we'll never be a star 
 
We are who we are 
We'll never be a star 
We are where we are 
But we'll never be a star (never be a star)

NOTHING TO SAY

 When I got told the other day, you said won't it be nice 
To spend some time and share a look there was no thinking twice 
The die was cast no time to lose as much as one can say 
Didn't hesitate to call you back and things were under way 
 
And if it wasn't for the circumstance and well against all odds 
Well that's enough for feeling great the best we could have got 
And just in case there's something wrong so much with you to share 
Much better anyways than watch or stroll round everywhere 
 
Nothing to say 
We got it there 
A long long way 
Right in our hands 
 
Nothing to say 
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection 
We'll have our way 
Like we always do 
 
Nothing to say 
Now we can use all we give all of our loving and affection 
We'll have our way 
Like we always do 
 
You called me up the other day just when I thought you would 
And asked if we could break apart as things ain't been too good 
I swallowed hard and got that feel I know it's called unease 
The confidence I've kept so well just came down piece by piece 
 
That's all it takes it's sad but done no way to disagree 
Time takes toll and that's the way it's always gonna be 
 
Cos it wasn't yet the circumstance but more than just a test 
There's little left for feeling great and all I need's some rest 
There's not a single glimpse of hope well someone took my place 
It's yet another turn for me, i'll be messin' round everywhere 
 
Nothing to say 
We got it there 
A long long way 
Thereof our hands 
 
Nothing to say 
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection 
I'll make my way 
Like I always do 
 
Nothing to say 
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection 
I'll make my way 
Like I always do 
 
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh 
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection,oh,oh,oh 
 
Nothing to say 
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection 
I'll make my way 
Like I always do 
 
Nothing to say 
So you refuse all I give all of my loving and affection 
I'll make my way 
Like I always do 
 
I got 
I got nothing to say 
I got nothing 
Nothing to say 
 
I got way 
I still brave horizon 
Nothing to spilled 
Long long way 
Nothing to say

NUMBER ONE

 Each time when one more year was over 
You refused to hear heavven's bells sound 
And the happiness in you heart's been set lower 
You were searching for friends but no one seemed to be 'round 
 
You merely should think of the good times 
'Cos there are so many ways you can go 
Take a look at yourself, you're still very young 
And big aims always take very long 
 
Now it's time for happiness, stay hard and trust your fate 
Don't forget you're something else you'll never be too late 
Trust your fathers' mighty spell you'll never be alone 
Fate will always turn out well and you'll be number one 
 
Shout at the world don't care what they say 
'Cos your life is now, here and today 
Luck is there, ev'rywhere 
Go on, reap its goods, that's the way 
You wanna have truth, relief from your pain 
But life takes its toll again and again 
Don't fear the night your future is paid 
And the tracks to your aims are laid 
 
Now it's time

 

HELLOWEEN
OPEN YOUR LIFE

 Do you know what there is just behind your wall 
Do you hate what you can't see on the spinning ball 
 
Ignorant and wasted that's what you are 
But you could be so much more 
Listen to your TV, believe the words 
And you're dumber than more 
 
Try to see the real picture 
To train your mind to read between the lines 
Take your level higher that is your way 
Just get up, start out today 
 
Time seems an endless road when we are young 
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong 
 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
 
Full synthetic anger that's what you breathe 
It's a strategy for all 
Telling people stories and bed time tales 
But the real important false 
 
So you grow the wrong seed inside your head 
To the will of the modern priest 
Supervised aggression instructed to sleep 
That's the devil let you breed 
 
All that we learn is just one point of view 
Out there in the world it may not become true 
 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
 
Time seems an endless road when we are young 
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong 
 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
Hey now, hey now, open your life 
Rise now, rise now, feel the new drive 
Hey now, hey now, open your life

PHANTOMS OF DEATH

 There are phantoms here on earth who take away our lives 
They kill your kids and they rape your wives 
They rip your flesh tear your heart take you down to hell 
They don't give a damn on any kind of life 
 
Phantoms bring evil, destruction and death 
Night after night the same old game 
They all look so harmless but deep in their hearts 
Satan is lurking, and he will break out 
 
Always someone at your back only waiting to attack 
Phantoms of death, Phantoms of death 
 
The empire of deceivers is built upon your fear 
You'll have to lose it 'cause the end is near 
Warheads, armies stand to strike I know it isn't right 
I wanna get out of here I don't wanna die 
 
Infernal destruction of fire you'll burn 
Then you'll be helpless but it's not too late 
Stand up right now and you'll be the winner 
Or Satan will get you, take you forever 
 
Genocide everywhere, where's the saviour of this world 
Phantoms of death, Phantoms of death 
 
Where is he the promised saviour the one who'll save the earth 
Perhaps he'll come to bury us but then it'll be too late 
Who are they who are the phantoms who will end our lives 
It's you and me, you and me open up your eyes 
 
Phantoms bring evil, destruction and death 
Night after night the same old game 
They all look so harmless but deep in their hearts 
Satan is lurking, and he will break out 
 
We are all parasites of this world we shall die

Wrapped up in harmless words that grin

Intended media mind control 
Shut down and see how beautiful life can be 
This is the prime of your lifetime 
You see through eyes of someone else 
More than the half of your lifetime 
Is just a tale in a storybook 
 
Push, enforce your independence 
Push your real intention 
Face your unconscious addiction 
Push your private fiction 
Push 
It's getting sicker frame by frame 
You're always staring at the same 
What is a lie, what is the truth? 
Incredible disgudting news 
The world is rough, the end is near 
Just calculation with your fear 
Without a shame nor least respect 
The operators stand erect 
 
This is the prime of your lifetime 
You see through eyes of someone else 
More than the half of your lifetime 
Is just a tale in a storybook 
 
Push, enforce your independence 
Push your real intention 
Face your unconscious addiction 
Push your private fiction

How can I feel what I'm trying to feel, How can I move when I'm heel to heel, You're always shouting about the doubt in my eye, But I can't answer cos my eyes are so dry. Now I can't live without the Rain. Yes I can't live without the Rain. I cant live without the rain, That's falling on my head, Rain that's falling on my head. Rain that's falling, Rain that's falling, Rain that's falling on my head. I'd started thinking back to you when, I'd like to send a line but then again, How can I write you when there aint no light, I'm feeling tight tonight but that's alright. Now I can't live without the rain, Yes I can't live without the rain

 Coming from the sewerage creepin' thru the pipes 
Born from modern chemistry a thing that is alive 
Growing in this rotten crap at places no one wipes 
Eating rats and stinking shit and all it needs to thrive 
 
The scientists got no way to fight 
For they can't find any weak point to get rid of it right 
You live your life and you don't know what's goin' on 
You just can't stop a thinking that the officials do you wrong 
 
You're sometimes wondering what the hell bit your baby's arm 
And the nuns at the holy mission can't keep the tramps from harm 
Even thieves around dark corners too scared to leave the door 
Frustrated businessmen needing a wank can't find themselves a whore 
 
You won't believe 'till you know that it's real 
From the pain in your stomach and the horror you feel 
You need a shit so you head off to the loo 
You're coming to the bog, now what you're gonna do !

REVOLUTION NOW

 Well,I think it's really time again for a revolution, 
Not to destroy at all costs but have a look at what's there. 
Can you remember a time when water was still water, 
Or are you too young to even know what we won't give to our heirs ? 
Inhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain ! 
It'll surely make our children feel a lot more sanel. 
Revolution now ! ... Revolution now ! ... 
I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissance, 
And today we're all faced with death, rubbers and AIDS. 
In'68 some people went out to fight for freedom, 
They would never ever have thought that their children wear ties. 
And if you come to San Francisco 
You're gonna meet some broken people there. 
Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Revolution now ! Now !

And one thing we can do is 
Work for a life without a fate 
 
We don't pay any taxes 
But the state is the axes 
Of our minds without love without hate 
 
We have a higher order 
No one needs to be a hoarder 
Our society is such a glorious thing 
 
In our centers we can dream of 
Anything you never think of 
You can't say we are puppets on a string 
 
Our minds are kept so clean 
Checked up on a screen 
They're holy men, they're saints 
Without them we might all fail 
 
We don't know war and crime 
Things of ancient times 
We just see it if we put on video 
 
The blue pass is for my life 
And the red one's for my wife 
It's the only thing we really need to show 
 
There are still some without rules 
But I tell you, they're all fools 
The Guardians will find them as we've seen 
 
We got banks where we freeze them 
They get new brains screwed in then 
And act contrarily to what they have been 
 
With new minds made so clean 
Checked up on a screen 
They will be the saints 
Without them we might all fail 
 
[Chorus:] 
Guardians of our lives 
Protect security 
They turn the key and they step in 
Controlling you and me 
Guardians of our lives 
Take care eternally 
 
[Solo: both / Kai / Mike] 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Puppets on a string

RISE AND FALL

 Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit 
everyone could see him fall 
and be sure it's been his last hit 
he's never been seen at all 
 
Some dictator felt progressive 
and lay down in the sun 
but his people were aggressive 
they killed him with a gun 
 
[Bridge:] 
Sometimes you're wrong 
by some things you have done 
you see fate is too strong 
nothing's won 
no use for a fight 
if you're not acting right 
you'll be cut down to size 
like a lie 
 
[Chorus:] 
It's the rise and fall 
the prize for all 
that ain't nice at all 
luck is like a ball 
you can't recall or care at all 
so better use your brain 
 
A little dragon could spit fire 
but never so for something bad 
he didn't know the knight's desire 
to throw a lance into his head 
 
Romeo loved his Juliet 
their parents told them Stop 
then it all turned out peculiar 
he couldn't get it up 
 
[Bridge:] 
And it's all in vain 
when you're living with pain 
reap not goods you have grown 
by your own 
feelings you like 
disappear overnight 
you sip up every grin 
free to win 
 
[Chorus:] 
It's the rise and fall 
the prize for all 
that ain't nice at all 
luck is like a ball 
you can't recall or care at all 
you nearly go insane 
 
[Solo: both/Kai/Mike] 
 
A spaceman flies the rocket 
that takes him to the stars 
thinks his wife is in his pocket 
but she's strolling 'round in bars 
 
The king of Los Angeles 
bought himself a teddy bear 
and the queen became shameless 
she did it with a chair 
 
[Bridge:] 
Sometimes you're wrong

SALVATION

 Sent to a world cold as steel 
Don't know where else I have been 
Where will I go? I can't tell 
Who would save us if we fell 
Can you feel what I see? 
In blind faith would you believe? 
Don't share my point of view 
But it may mean a lot to you 
 
Tell me will we remember 
How it used to be? 
Will it be the same 
In a time in the future? 
Will there be a different way 
Can one ever say? 
 
Anthem for a distant world 
We'll all be alike 
Be there 'til eternity 
One will see 
When salvation comes our way 
 
All my life I was sure 
Kept my thoughts clean, real and pure 
Just as I will always know 
Were down here to learn and grow 
I am my own entity 
And the world is there for free 
Keeps me alive 'til that day 
When my soul will find the way 
 
In another dimension 
You may find paradise 
We'll be safe and warm 
I've been told there will be everyone 
I held so close and near 
There will be no fear 
 
Anthem for a distant world 
We'll be all alike 
Be there 'til eternity 
One will see 
When salvation comes our way 
 
Anthem for a distant world 
We'll be all alike 
Be there 'til eternity 
One will see 
When salvation comes 
When salvation comes 
When salvation comes our way

SAVAGE

 You hear the people talking you walk the wrong street 
Painting all things black and step on your feet 
Flabby stomach, styled hair, trousers full of air 
Their morality is real ours isn't there 
 
They don't know, no they can't see 
Our hearts close to the sun 
Different in our hearts filled with 
That faith we carry on 
 
They just call us savage 
That's what I like to be 
Let them call us savage 
Cause that's what we like to be 
 
See the people wonder we run in our direction 
Let the narrow minded sleep we better do some action 
Across the universe you smell the smell of lies 
I'm trying to be the winner not the sacrifice 
 
They don't know, no they can't see 
Our hearts close to the sun 
Different in our hearts filled with 
That faith we carry on 
 
They just call us savage 
That's what I like to be 
Let them call us savage 
Cause that's what we like to be 
 
See them run they know no fun 
And look what they have done 
In this world full of rules 
We look just like fools 
 
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me (Savage) 
We come close every day to the time table life 
So mart they start their backwards fight 
I know what they think when I see them lookin' at me (Savage) 
One day they will drop the bomb 
Cause it's necessary to show the power 
One day they will give a shit on what you say 
 
They just call us savage 
That's what I like to be 
Let them call us savage 
Cause that's what we like to be

 Piece by piece you're tearin' me apart 
Give to me and try another start 
Brick by brick you really love this game 
Things from which I can't refrain 
 
So many stories have been told 
I give a damn, they're much too old 
How often will we face the end of our dreams? 
When will I see it all come true? 
A splendid time for me and you 
Can we expect it bein' nice as it seems? 
 
Will you be my secret alibi 
Angel of my nights 
Can we do it right? 
Let's just try each others love so sweet 
Till we can't deny my secret alibi 
 
Ding by ding can you dig my dong 
It may come short but it might come long 
Limb by limb you're climbing on my tree 
Making things more fun for me 
 
So many stories I've been told 
I give a damn, they're much too old 
How often will we face the end of our dreams?

SHIT AND LOBSTER

 Once there was a time when mankind 
Dreamed about reaching the stars 
Nowadays we're almost ready 
Even for the wars 
 
Some told lies and they were famous 
Cause of making many wars 
One told right, they punished him 
With pain and crucify 
 
What is right and what is wrong 
Can I prevent, can I be strong 
Quick enough to run away 
Or brave enough for here to stay 
 
Time will bring the answer 
Will we feed the cancer 
We don't give a damn at all 
 
Some get shit and some get lobster 
Bring my ass into the sun 
It takes some time to realize 
We cannot eat a gun 
 
The fat gets fatter, the poor stays poor 
The money maker sells the skin 
But you don't ask and you don't see 
The world you're living in 
 
Got my fears and got my doubts 
Tell me what it's all about 
Should I try a step 
Or should I stay and wait another day 
 
Time will bring the answer 
Will we feed the cancer 
We don't give a damn at all

SILICON DREAMS

 Daily in the news and on the screen 
they wanna show you how to look like 
how to be a star 
But if you bignosed without muscles 
you are not attractive 
you don't fit in what's so popular 
Four pounds too much without a suntang 
selfrespect is fading 
they already tooked away your pride 
California dreamgirl with her brain down in her pussy 
you will never reach her you're too small 
 
Wake up all you idiots don't close your eyes 
and see there is only one thing you can be 
this is just you and nothing else 
start to believe all in yourself 
stop to running after visions you don't need 
 
who is in the mirror 
do you really trust this face 
smiles at you so bad and ugly 
this is not yourself anymore 
will a soul feel well in plastic bodies 
where it don't belong 
silicon and lifted faces 
don't you really know who you are 
 
Don't try to hide 
if you don't look like Monroe 
the smile on your face this is real 
just be yourself that's the deal 
 
California dreamman 
with a smile made out of plastic 
juicy woman dreams that you can buy 
selling you a dream so far away 
and so fantastic until you realise you won't get high 
 
Now you're close to suicide 
your dream bursts like a bubble 
all the gossip you once liked is gone 
your addiction to be skinny is driving you to madness 
I hope now you can see what you have done

It's so hard to find a sign of a way to go 
 
Don't need to stone my brain, I need my head for something else 
I wanna live and learn, step by step I'm going on 
 
Send me a sign, don't wanna resign too soon 
What situation will come I can't endure

SOMETHING

 [The Beatles] 
 
Something In The Way She Moves 
Attracts me like no other lover 
Something in the way she woos me 
I don't want to leave her now 
You know I believe and how 
 
Somewhere in her smile she knows 
That I don't need no other lover 
Something in her style that shows me 
I don't want to leave her now 
You know I believe and how 
 
You're asking me will my love grow 
I Don't Know I don't know 
You stick around and it may show 
I don't know, I don't know 
 
Something in the way she knows 
And all I have to do is think of her 
Something in the things she shows me 
I don't want to leave her now 
You know I believe and how

Ground Control to Major Tom 
Ground Control to Major Tom 
Take your protein pills 
And put your helmet on 
Ground Control to Major Tom 
Commencing countdown, engines on 
Check ignition 
And may God's love be with you 
 
Ten, nine eight, seven, six, five 
Four, three, two, one, liftoff 
This is Ground Control to Major Tom 
You've really made the grade 
And the papers want to know 
Whose shirts you wear 
Now it's time to leave the capsule 
If you dare 
 
This is Major Tom to Ground Control 
I'm stepping through the door 
And I'm floating in a most peculair way 
And the stars look very different 
Today 
 
For here 
Am I sitting in a tin can 
Far above the world 
Planet Earth is blue 
And there's nothing I can do 
 
Though I'm past 100,000 miles 
I'm feeling very still 
And I think my spaceship knows 
Which way to go 
Tell my wife I love her very much, 
She knows 
 
Ground Control to Major Tom 
Your circuit's dead, 
There's something wrong 
Can you hear me Major Tom 
Can you hear me Major Tom 
Can you hear me Major Tom 
Can you.... 
 
Here am I floating round my tin can 
Far above the Moon 
Planet Earth is blue 
And there's nothing I can do

STAR INVASION

 There he's sitting in his cockpit 
Out on guard, ten thousand miles from home 
Lookin' through his little window 
Earth appears as God's blue magic dome 
 
Just a little bit disturbing 
Are those coloured spaceships 
Closing in 
 
Star Invasion 
From behind the sun 
Destination 
Straight into his face 
 
Seven years they taugh and told him 
What to do and how to act right now 
He would have to push a button 
In his panic he just don't know how 
Seems like there's no red alert no more 
And so that squirrel wasn't there before 
 
Star invasion 
From behind the sun 
Complication 
Say what can be done? 
 
Near to a thousand eight squirrels beam aboard and say hello 
Puke and shit his control board, dematerialize and steer their ships 
Away from earth 
 
Star invasion 
Praise the Lord they're gone

 You're hanging around and got nuthin' to do 
You wanna get out some pills in front of you 
You fly on invisivble wings 
Be careful my friend for too many can kill 
You say that the meaning of life's in those pills 
You forget all earthly things 
 
You swallow your pill you wanna feel free 
A trip to a world made of games 
You do it again yet it's never the same 
But a junkie's not somethin' to be 
 
[Chorus:] Starlight! Fallin' in deep thru your eyes! 
Starlight! Shinin' down for your soul to arise! 
 
Now there's a needle lying in front of you 
I'm frightened of those things 
But I'll know what you'll do 
You need it to escape from the night, ha ha 
You ride on thru heaven you don't feel no pain 
You ride on and ride on again and again 
On the needle that brings you the light 
 
You feel the mind blowin' stuff 
Flow thru your veins 
You take off and fly to the sun 
But when you get too near your wings will be burnt 
You'll die in the flames and you'll fall 
 
[Chorus]

 Headless 
The machine down 
Coming to the low sound 
Feeling like a real man 
 
Racing 
Flashing from down under 
Flesh and blood and thunder 
Trembling wheel in cold wheel in cold hand 
 
Faster, much faster wot a human speed disaster 
Deeper, much deeper on through the void I cast'er 
 
I'm a steel tormentor 
And I speed 'round ev'ry curve 
I'm a mean imperator 
Of my intimate machine

Near to devastation 
Losing all my patience 
Cannot make this kit fly 
 
Danger 
Muscular contraction 
Out for satisfaction 
Mere intoxication 
 
Nightride, it's nightride try to catch my taillights 
So sad, I'm so sad, but you won't ever suck my steel bride

STEP OUT OF HELL

 Time has come, start your search for tomorrow, 
No escape from that long trail of sorrow. 
You don't know how it keeps going on. Oh ... No ... 
Wake up out of misty dreams, 
Evil drugs is starting to grab you, to grab you. 
Step out of hell demons dancing around your brain. 
Step out of hell streams of madness flow through your veins. 
Step out of hell go on like this you're gonna be dead. 
Step out of hell take my hand I wanna help ... But can I ? 
You did your best to keep yourself down, 
Give it a rest and just turn around ! 
It's only a one way street of lies ... Yes it is ! 
Living in a twilight zone, 
Get away out of that drug jungle, that drug jungle. 
Step out of hell demons dancing around your brain. 
Step out of hell streams of madness flow through your veins. 
Step out of hell go on like this you're gonna be dead. 
Step out of hell take my hand I wanna help you. 
Another line, have a good time, you don't mind 
To turn you brain inside out, to serve the final rite. 
Step out of hell demons dancing around your brain. 
Step out of hell streams of madness flow through your veins. 
Step out of hell go on like this you're gonna be dead. 
Step out of hell take my hand I wanna help you !

STILL I DON'T KNOW

 I'm Asking Here 
I'm asking there 
And we all seem to share 
Different gains for life 
Though We'll all arrive 
At the big end somewhere 
But we don't know whats more when its over 
Is there heaven or hell? 
 
[Chorus:] 
I wonder if there's something when my time's 
Run out in life 
Still I don't know, Still I don't Know 
Wonder if there's music, rubbersex 
And a Mac Drive 
Still I don't know, Still I don't know 
 
All we know is here 
What we lone and fear 
Its a question of time 
When all is said and done 
When we're dead and gone 
We'll just disappear 
 
Yes We don't know whats more when its over 
Is there heaven or hell? 
 
[Chorus:] 
I wonder if there's something 
My Lifes run out of time 
Still I don't know, Still I don't know 
Wonder If there's smokers 
Even in Deutsche Bahn 
Still I don't know, Still I don't know 
 
Wonder if there's something 
Like a cigarette or some wine 
Wonder if I'm lonely 
If i'll meet a friend of mine

Still I don't know, Still I don't know.......

STILL WE GO

 In the beginning 
Out of nowhere 
We had a dream 
And Now It's Helloween 
 
Speed up to a higher limit 
Change gear, we're losin' our spirit 
We won't take your special advice 
We are close to a metal breakdown 
Sirens to warn of our meltdown 
We couldn't see that headline 
 
Now we can see a horizon 
We're gonna be here to stay 
If you cannot see our sign 
You must be blind 
 
Still we go 
Still we go 
Still we go 
On the metal highway 
Still we go 
 
Warn out, won't die on our knees 
Shine on, proud as we can be 
Time has come to stop pleasing you 
Hey man, Let's get it together 
Our strength will last forever 
Push us as far as we can go 
 
Now we can see a horizon 
We're gonna be here to stay 
If you cannot see our sign 
You must be blind 
 
Still we go 
Still we go 
Still we go 
On the metal highway 
Still we go 
 
[SOLO] 
 
How many times must a man cross the lines 
To find his right way 
 
Still we go 
Still we go 
Still we go 
On the metal highway 
Still we go

SUN 4 THE WORLD

 Forty million years ago 
There was a boy called Leif 
His skin was grey, his eyes were red 
The tentacles counted five 
 
Grown up in a normal house 
His parents beloved son 
There never was the slightest sign 
He'd be the chosen one 
 
Leif (No!) 
Help us (No!) 
Shelter us 
 
He turns into the Sun for the world 
Sun for the world 
What would I say (what would I say) 
Would it be me, my friend 
 
Down on earth we see a star 
Dying in it's light 
Then suddenly it all explodes 
A new sun shines with Leif 
 
Leif (No!) 
Help us (No!) 
Shelter us 
 
He turns into the Sun for the world 
Sun for the world 
What would I say (what would I say) 
Would it be me 
 
Sun for the world 
Sun for the world 
What would you do (what would you do) 
Would it be you, my friend 
 
Leif 
Help us 
Shelter us 
 
He turns into the Sun for the world 
Sun for the world 
What would I say (what would I say) 
Would it be me 
 
Sun for the world 
Sun for the world 
What would you do (what would you do) 
Would it be you, my friend

TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT

 Been here just long enough to see what trip you're on 
Suffered from your ugly deeds 
The way you're pushin all, Oh No 
Better watch out what you're doing 
Better take some rest or get right of here, oh yeah 
Haven't you hurt the people tryin to be your friend 
 
[Chorus:] 
You take it to the limit, you take it to the top 
You take it to the limit, until you get stopped 
You take it to the limit, you take it to the top 
 
Stop! Stop! 
 
You think you're somebody 
But you'll never be 
On the back of others 
You're just acting 
Like a thief, oh yeah 
 
Better watch out what you're sayin 
Better take your hat and get right out of here 
Didn't you lose all the people 
Tryin to be your friend 
 
[Chorus:] 
You take it to the limit, you take it to the top 
You take it to the limit, til you get stopped 
You take it to the limit, til you get shot, stop it! 
Take it to the limit, take it to the top 
Take it to the limit, til you get stopped 
Take it to the limit, get out of my head!

TAKE ME HOME

 Now I'm here all alone 
Takin' care of my own 
Down in no man's land 
Got no friend, got no dime 
Only plenty of time 
Where's the saving hand? 
 
I got that feeling to need more and more attention 
That is the fever, don't leave me alone 
I got that feeling to make more than conversation 
That is the fever, where's my home? 
 
Take me home 
Take me home 
Take me home 
 
It's not true what you see 
Behind that mask that's not me 
Try to reach my world 
Can't you see I'm so blind 
Stay with me to change my mind 
No more nightmares, girl 
 
I got that feeling to need more and more attention 
That is the fever, don't leave me alone 
I got that feeling to make more than conversation 
That is the fever, where's my home? 
 
Take me home 
Take me home 
Take me home

I got that feeling to need more and more attention

 We're living in a constant fight 
Too much pressure everywhere 
And all around 
 
Don't let it pull you down 
Hold on tight 
Cling to your dreams 
 
Don't you depend on someone else 
Think for yourself and win the race 
 
The chance you got comes never twice 
Do your best, (and) do it right 
 
Time will come but don't you hide 
You are on your way 
 
You're led by God but you're not a pawn 
Should live your life, don't care 'bout any scorn 
 
Just let them fool around 
No need to cry 
Don't give up 
 
Try to be as smart as you can be 
I know you own so much ability

THE DARK RIDE

 All board step right this way 
The dark ride is leaving soon 
Just sign your name on the dotted line 
All I want is just your soul 
Tighten your belt and lets go 
Standing in line to get to the fairground 
Heading to the wicked side 
One way ticket, there is no returning 
Leave your soul at the gates 
 
Out of doubt, no hope 
Satan feeds our madness 
Insanity confirms where we stand 
Spit the red vile breath and 
Wrath is our gift that 
Leads direct to armageddon 
 
Take a place on the dark ride 
Slowly creeping up quickly coming down 
Take a spin on the dark ride 
May too far from the other side 
 
Step inside and take this final journey 
Your fantasies will come true 
Inclination without liberation 
Lifes carousel is catching you 
 
Even through the darkest phase 
Be it thick or thin 
I'm your pain when you can't feel 
Driven to our final fate 
Jump out of this game 
 
Take a place on the dark ride 
Slowly creeping up quickly coming down 
Take a spin on the dark ride 
May too far from the other side 
 
Is there any wonder? 
Why we came about 
Was it for love? 
Or to let sin abound 
Isn't it a wonder 
Awake from blood thick dreams 
Remove all the stones from our hearts 
We must all believe 
 
Ohhh, will we find a way to the other side 
Heading for a light 
Who is holding the key, why can't we see 
The dark ride 
 
I force the engine of your deadly sins 
Even through the darkest phase 
Be it thick or thin 
I'm your pain when you can't feel 
I know too well you'll follow me, you follow me down 
 
Is there any wonder? 
Why we came about 
Was it for love? 
Or to let sin abound 
Isn't it a wonder 
Awake from blood thick dreams 
Remove all the stones from our hearts 
We must all believe

THE DEPARTED SUN IS GOING DOWN

 There I stood with the sun in my eyes 
Dust on my face 
And mouth parched and dry 
Memories are racing 
Flashing scenes through my mind 
I know what's ahead 
Today would be a good day to die 
 
Once I thought I had a golden heart 
Once I thought my dreams would never shatter 
Now I stand here 
Jaded and cold 
Epitaph being carved on my tombstone 
 
I would die for you would you die with me? 
No, you can't deny 
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me? 
Blaze across the sky 
 
Sun is going down 
And there's no tomorrow 
Sun is going down 
Going down on me 
Sun is going down 
No more time to borrow 
Dance with the devil 
Sun is going down 
For the lonely hearted 
Sun is going down 
In a blink of an eye 
Sun is going down 
On the departed 
Laugh at the devil 
 
I would die for you would you die with me? 
Caught in a fight 
I was drawn again 
I never thought I'd be betrayed 
By my best friend 
He lost his life as he went for mine 
If this is the end 
I want to die with you 
 
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me? 
Blaze across the sky 
 
Sun is going down 
Going down on me 
Sun is going down 
No more time to borrow 
Dance with the devil 
Sun is going down 
For the lonely hearted 
Sun is going down 
In a blink of an eye 
Sun is going down 
On the departed 
Laugh at the devil 
 
I would die for you would you die with me? 
No, you can't deny 
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me? 
Blaze across the sky 
 
Sun is going down 
Going down on me 
Sun is going down 
No more time to borrow 
Dance with the devil 
Sun is going down 
For the lonely hearted 
Sun is going down 
In a blink of an eye 
Sun is going down 
On the departed 
Laugh at the devil 
 
Sun is going down 
No more time to borrow

THE GAME IS ON

 Have you seen this little toy 
When you're down it gives you joy 
You escape reality 
Delve into its TV screen 
For the rich and for the poor 
For the even more secure 
Doesn't matter where you are, 
Where you go or when you been 
Well, there's still no guarantee 
For your virgin mind, you see 
Just go on and play the game 
You will surely go insane 
 
The game is on 
And you have gone 
Gone to a world on its display 
And the game is fun 
But when it has won 
All you ever hear is what it says 
 
There's a great amount of fumes 
Coming out from somebody's room 
The firemen got there 
Walking their way up the stairs 
Find a man in a chair 
But it doesn't seem he's there 
With a grey box in his hands 
He has gone to another land 
 
The game is on 
And you have gone 
Gone to a world on its display 
And the game is fun 
But when it has won 
All you ever hear is what it says 
 
[SOLO] 
 
You have played it much too long 
Now your senses get things strong 
All your walls come crashing down 
Now it's time for you to frown 
How d'you like this heavy load? 
Guess your brain will soon explode 
You never had this ugly feel 
It's time to dial an emergency

 Sightless the one who relays on promise 
Blind he who follows the path of vows 
Deaf he who tolerates words of deception 
But they who fathom the truth bellow 
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane 
The madness of the game 
Guilty the one with his silent knowledge 
Exploiting innocence for himself 
Dangerous he whom our faith was given 
Broad is the road leading straight to hell 
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane 
The madness of the game 
Dangerous he whom our faith was given 
Broad is the road leading straight to hell 
Shout! Shout! The madness of the crowds hail insane

THE TUNE

 Sometimes there's no tomorrow 
Sometimes you hate the day 
You feel there may be something 
That intends to screw with fate 
 
Take a look at what surround you 
Each time you watch the news 
Your mind gets set by someone's will 
A template you can't choose 
 
Love and desire, dry ice or fire 
Don't you just want to flee their magic spell 
 
No mercy for the nations two people are at war 
Beliefs divide the dream they share of peace and harmony 
Their eyes look up to heaven, address our god in prayers 
Their souls exposed, they may decease by emperor's decree 
 
Look, how they're crying 
There's no denying 
Now change the channel you're remote control 
And the tune goes on eternally 
 
For those who share the fear 
On a frequency for you and me 
You stare but you can't see 
You hear and you agree 
 
We're all here for a reason 
So we can't just hang around 
There's so much left to see and learn 
Make way for common ground 
 
And those who head the wrong way 
Will rate as minor class 
As castaways they'll render fools 
When the horsemen come to rule 
 
Strike the last hour in their glass towers 
Infinite lust has made the curtain fall 
 
And the tune goes on eternally 
For those who share the fear 
On a frequency for you and me 
You stare but you can't see 
You hear but you agree 
You agree 
 
And the tune goes on eternally 
For those who share the fear 
On a frequency for you and me 
You stare but you can't see 
You hear but you agree 
 
And the tune goes on eternally 
For those who long to hear 
And those freaks sense they're superior 
We're hypnotised, you see 
They wave and we agree

TIME

 Feel it running off 
So strong and clear 
An age is over fast 
And dissapears 
Help him if you can 
His hour will come soon 
Push away his fear 
He'll see Elysium 
It's time 
It's time 
 
Guard him a little while 
And calm his shiver 
Wash and dry his tears 
And cool his fever 
Take the bibles words 
Speak it pure his soul 
Lay love in his mind 
His close to the final goal 
It's time 
It's time 
 
It's time to go 
Time for the freedom 
Time to face what we all believe in 
Pray strong 
Pray to the higher 
Turn your back on the devil's fire 
Time to go 
Time for the freedom 
Time to face what we all believe in 
Time is passing by 
 
When his mind was clear 
He called you brother 
Now his brain is dazed 
It's resigning rather 
Mother take his hand 
Say a last Good Bye 
We're not gifted to 
Turn water into wine 
It's time 
It's time 
 
It's time to go 
Time for the freedom 
Time to face what we all believe in 
Pray strong 
Pray to the higher 
Turn your back on the devil's fire 
Time to go 
Time for the freedom 
Time to face what we all believe in 
Time is passing by

TIME GOES BY

 I saw a million people cry 
I heard so little laughter 
Tasted so many tears of mine 
Still didn't feel good after 
Sometimes I just wish 
To turn back time 
But if I could there is no world 
No world that I just want to see 
In my mind And time goes by 
Passing by my eyes 
And I still wait here for better 
Time goes by 
Deaf to pain and cries 
And I still wait here for better 
For better 
Forever

TIME OF THE OATH

 In a circle of fire 
On a cold winter night 
I spoke out my desire 
Made a promise 
I couldn't hide, no! 
 
In a dream 
He came along and told me Your time has come Your mind 
belongs to me 
 
It's the time of the oath 
The time of the oath 
My sweetest memories die in the cold 
It's the time of the oath 
 
See me covered with sadness 
And I'll soon wish to die 
When that overcoming madness 
Is eating up my mind 
 
Here and now 
I look back at a good time 
No more lie I slowly say goodbye 
It's the time of the oath 
The time of the oath 
My sweetest memories die in the cold 
It's the time of the oath 
 
In a dream 
He came along and told me Your time has come Just slowly say good bye 
It's the time of the oath 
The time of the oath 
My sweetest memories die in the cold 
It's the time of the oath

Di es i rae, di es il la

TWILIGHT OF THE GODS

 [Melody Solo Kai] 
 
[Insania 20 14] 
 
We'we thrown away our former gods 
Controlling our day 
We have created better ones 
So we control the way 
 
We are the ones with the power 
To hold down the enemy 
Our gods are perfection 
And they are protecting our lives 
We still need some more of them 
To be safe from the other side 
As long as we're stronger 
Nothing will happen to us 
 
Fireflash in the night 
just an evil dream 
Holy war in the sky .....never 
 
[Insania 20 16] 
 
Error in store 103 
We watch the sun at night 
The pretty gods we're built ourselves 
Now terminate our lives 
Silicone brain powered voices 
Are crying attack tonight 
Our gods are now fighting 
In anger, burning our world 
Doomsday has come 
And ethere is no place to hide away 
The future is no turning back 
Fireflash in the night 
Now reality 
Holy war in the sky..... 
[chorus] 
Twilight of the gods 
Insania's dead and gone 
Another world was born 
But the twilight soon will come 
[Solo] 
[Mike/Harmony both/Kai] 
Fireflash in the night 
Now reality 
Holy war in the sky.....

VICTIM OF FATE

 I was born in the rotten part of the town 
The biggest trap I had seen 
Wherever you'll go and wherever you'll get to 
Evil is all around 
 
My mother's a bitch my father's a killer 
Gettin' paid for murder 
Fightin' and strugglin' the whole day 
The only way to survive 
 
[Bridge:] 
 
Wanted from law but they'll never catch me 
I'd much rather die in this bloody war 
 
[Chorus:] 
 
Fly high touch the sky 
Never know the reason why it ends 
Victim of fate! 
 
I had to kill people to save my own life 
I don't wanna go to hell 
I started at the bottom 
I'm headin' for the top 
 
I'll never return I'll never go back 
To that goddamn part of the town 
Headhunters won't get me 'cause I'm not stupid 
But this ain't the life I dreamt of 
 
[Bridge] 
 
[Chorus] 
 
What now lonely man who's standing 
In the shadows of the streets 
You're left alone with no helpin' hand beside you 
You hide from the daylight living in darkness 
You got no friends you can trust nobody 
Except for yourself 
The only shade that's beside you 
Is the shade of Lucifer 
Laughing with a satanic smile 
And his friend Death sharpens his sickle 
You don't wanna die, do you? But you will 
You will burn in hell! 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Fly high, touch the sky, you will die!

WAKE UP THE MOUNTAIN

 Some people die 
And even never realize 
Man's growing blind 
Is seeimg owly with the eyes 
We think we're strong 
Belive we never could be wrong 
But we ar fools 
Because we're dying by the rules 
 
Though I cannot change the world we're living in 
I can always change myself 
 
One more to count in Wake up the mountain 
All colour's slowly Turning to gray 
All world is darkling Wake up the mountain 
And we will find it once more again 
 
Cash and carees 
Built on the countless sums of fears 
All godos of life 
Begin to vanish behimd tears 
How do we know 
Why did we choose the way we follow 
Why do we hurt 
Why do we hurt the ones we love 
 
Though I cannot change the worlg we're living in 
I can always change myself 
 
One more to count in Wake up the mountain 
All colour's slowly Turning to gray 
All world is darkling Wake up the mountain 
And we will find it once more again 
 
We made the rules and we can change them 
Break down the orders one by one 
We made the laws and we can break them 
Break down the mountain, stone by stone by stone...

WARRIOR

 Blackened sky a final flash 
Death is in the air 
Warriors without a face 
Destruction everywhere 
 
[Bridge:] 
 
Silent falls the hammer 
Noone hears the cries 
No escaping from this hell 
Your prayers won't be heard...so die 
 
Brainless cruel commanders 
Sending death and pain 
Soldiers only robots 
Fight for their life in vain 
 
[Brigde] 
 
[Chorus:] 
 
Die now die warrior! 
Die now die warrior! 
 
Somewhere in the shelter sit the men 
Who hold your fate in hands 
Playin' chess and you're the loser 
You're a small pawn in their game 
 
Somewhere in the shelter sit the men 
And they don't realise 
A war without survivors is a fight 
That's never won...so die! 
 
Barren land desolate waste 
Destruction is complete 
Survivors creeping thru the ruins 
Decaying flesh and meat 
 
Somewhere in a shelter 
Some pigs are still alive 
And still they play the game 
They don't give a damn...so die!

 Blood in my pillow 
Blood in my skin 
Am I going mad 
Or was this a dream? 
There in the depth 
The hollow souls wait 
Voices surround me 
Tempting my fate 
Then out of nowhere 
Figures in white 
Guarding my soul in the fight 
 
We are strong we re'alive 
We have faith in his might 
We believe in the everlasting light 
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there 
We will fight for what's just and what's right 
We damn the night 
 
Out in the blackness 
Shivering cold 
Doubt takes on shape 
Fear the unknown 
Eyes of the fallen 
Piercing their glance 
Whispers of doom 
Left without chance 
Then out of nowhere 
Figures in white 
Shield my soul in the fight 
 
We're strong, we're alive 
We have faith in his might 
We believe in the everlasting light 
Anytime, anywhere we will always be there 
We will fight for what's just and what's right

WHEN THE SINNER

 Now it's time to shake it all up, to be free, 
Now it's time to make us some room to let us be. 
Oh, it feels so bad, yes, if fells so bad, 
When everything good looks so bad, 
When everything right goes so wrong. 
I am up to break it all down what's in my way, 
I won't stop until I am where I'm going to stay. 
No one holds me back, no, no one holds me back, 
Don't wanna be what I am not, 
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck. 
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere, 
 Over my head look over my head 
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around 
 And you won't see no halo 
We keep on looking 'til we know what for. 
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it? 
 It's driving me mad 
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know, 
 I must hold it back inside 
But anyway we've got to make a stop. 
When the sinner searches sin it's all of us, 
When we finally search inside it's under us. 
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it who must pay ? 
All I've ever done I've done for you ! 
In my mind the battle goes on 'til I give up, 
Will we find the key of life we oncehave dropped ? 
Do you realy care ? Tell me you realy care ! 
You may find Mr. Blane, but the guilt of life burns everywhere. 
Give me light to see my inside, give me light tosee my sin, 
 Over my head look over my head 
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad, 
 And you won't see no halo 
You must be joking when you point at me. 
Hey ! Don't you blame me ! Don't you touch me ! 
Won't you ever leave me be ? I wanna live! Don't wanna think! 
 It's driving me mad 
Why should I give what I can drink ? 
 I must hold it back inside 
When the sinner searches sin it's all of us, 
When we finally search inside it's under us. 
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it who must pay ? 
All I've ever done I've done for you ! 
Pain I feel inside it's such a Shame. 
No one fights fair but who's to Blame ? 
Might be the game of life but it ain't over. 
Now ! I walk my way firm any 
Now ! My conscience speaks andthere are Doubts ! 
But nothing's sure in life and it ain't over. Now ! 
I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere, 
 Over my head look over my head 
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around 
 And you won't see no halo 
We keep on looking 'til we know what for. 
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it? 
 It's driving me mad 
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know, 
 I must hold it back inside 
But anyway we've got to make a stop. 
When the sinner searches sin it's all of us, 
When we finally search inside it's under us. 
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it who must pay ? 
All I've ever done I've done for you ! ......

He would stay like before 
 
So I take my life 
Back from where the rain grows 
Die to survive 
Back from where the rain grows 
 
From where the rain grows 
I know where thr rain grows 
I'm back from where the rain grows

 

HELLOWEEN
WHERE THE RAIN GROWS

 I never looked higher 
Than I could see 
Never gave less 
Than I have given me 
The more you have taken 
You turned into fakes 
I finally know how 
Why for heavens'sake? 
 
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried 
Don't act so deaf and blind 
Don't think that is someone's made dumb to the core 
He would stay like before 
 
So I take my life 
Back from where the rain grows 
Die to survive 
Back from where the rain grows 
 
Now you call me liar 
'Cause you are just the 
 Always have right 
fools majority 
I think that if someone 
Starved at your side 
You'd all turn your back 
Won't give any dime 
 
Don't tell me you did not see that I cried 
Don't act so deaf and blind 
Don't think that is someone's made sad to the core 
He would stay like before 
 
So I take my life 
Back from where the rain grows 
Die to survive 
Back from where the rain grows 
 
[SOLO] 
 
So I take my life 
Back from where the rain grows 
Die to survive 
Back from where the rain grows 
I know where the rain grows 
I'm back from where the rain grows

WHITE ROOM

 [Cream] 
 
In the white room 
With black curtains 
Near the station 
Black country roof 
No gold pavements 
Tired starlings 
Silver horses 
Ran down moonbeams 
In your dark eyes 
Dawn light smiles 
On you leaving 
My contentment 
 
I'll wait in this place 
Were the sun never shines 
Wait in this places 
Where the shadows 
Run from themselves 
 
You said no strings 
Could secure you 
At the station 
Platform ticket 
Restless diesels 
Goodbye windows 
I walked in 
To such a sad time 
At the staiton 
As I walked out 
Felt my own need 
Just beginning 
 
I'll wait in the queue 
When the trains come back 
Lie with you 
Where the shadows 
Run from themselves 
 
At the party 
She was kindness 
In the hard crowd 
Consolation 
For the old wound 
Now forgotten 
Yellow tigers 
Crouched in jungles 
In her dark eyes 
She's just dressing 
Goodbye windows 
Tired starlings 
 
I'll sleep in this place 
With the lonely crowd 
Lie in the dark 
Where the shadows 
Run from themselves

WHY?

 Father, it's time Have a heart for your child who cries in pain Not a new sign But I strike that'll blow those fools away Open your eyes If you've got any you just look for too long a time They spit on your name Doin' everything you darnned as highest crime They believe they could walk on the water Playing 'god, sleep with the devils' daughter Killed your son and might kill mine But you don't mind Why, Lord, why Tell me why In these lonely days I'd need your answer There's a reason why How could you fail? Still it's time, turn the black into the light Why do you wait? Do you look down and laugh at what you find? Can't you see they are mistreating their daughters They believe they could walk on the waters They killed your son and might kill mine But you don't mind Why, Lord, why Tell me why In these lonely days I'd need your answer There's a reason why Why, Lord, why Tell me why Your the only light Forever lasting Tell me, father, why [SOLO] Why, Lord, why Tell me why In these lonely days I'd need your answer There's a reason why Why, Lord, why Tell me why Your the only light Forever lasting Tell me, father, why Father, it's time Father, it's time...

WINDMILL

 Time goes whenever you are, time is your guiding star, 
That shines all through your life, makes you feel and move. 
My dreams are out in the far, so are yours a part 
Of secret fairy tales, dripped on the wings of a mystery mill. 
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning 
Show me the way, take me today. 
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning 
Longing for love and a chance to be free. 
Don't feel alone and depressed, someone will come at last, 
To soothe your stumbling mind, to keep it away from the evil storm. 
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning 
Show me the way, take me today. 
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning 
Longing for love and a chance to be free. 
[Solo: Michael Weikath] 
Windmill, windmill,keep on turning ... 
Time goes whenever you are ...

YOU ALWAYS WALK ALONE

 [Solo: both] 
 
When I hold the key to open heaven's door 
I will never make the mistake and give it back 
when I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late 
I will never give it back 
 
[Bridge:] 
There's just one way I see 
the way I think it's right for me 
you say to me I will repent what I do 
if it's right I'll stop before 
 
When I see the light of sun will fade away 
And I reveal what I have loved before 
it's too late when I can't see the hours I pay 
and I reveal what I have loved before 
 
[Bridge:] 
There's just one way I see 
the way I think it's right for me 
you say to me I will repent what I do 
if it's right I'll stop before 
 
[Chorus:] 
The life I try to give is 
all I have inside of me 
it's one kind of life for me 
this music you hear 
the strength we have inside is 
so much more than you will know 
but if you can't see the life around 
you'll always walk alone 
 
[Solo: Kai/Mike] 
 
Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes 
see his strong hands 
but tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice 
see the drunk man, try to ask him why 
he will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie 
there's a fight in his head he cannot win 
getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin 
 
You you cannot hide 
You you cannot describe your feelings inside 
 
[Solo: Mike/Kai] 
 
[Chorus:] 
The life I try to give is 
all I have inside of me 
it's one kind of life for me 
this music you hear 
the strength we have inside is 
so much more than you will know 
but if you can't see the life around 
you'll always walk alone

 

HELLOWEEN
YOU RUN WITH THE PACK

 To give what I got, to take what I need to live, it ain't easy for me, 
Darken my eyes, tell me lies, but all nice, tell me how I have to be, 
Get me in your foolish game, destroy my defence, lock me in, 
Throw me in your lion's cage, 'cos then I'm out of your way, 
 
Cry with the wolves, run with the pack, 
Turn around to save your neck, 
'Cos someone always keeps you in confusion, 
Squeezed in a box, who'll win the race, 
Ask no questions in this case, 
What's left is only you and your illusions, 
 
Charity is all your duty, they preach you: sharing your goods is your pride, 
Patriotic Love, kill the enemy first, I can hear the other side, 
What's the way out of this game? You'll either win or you lose, 
I run in circles, who's to blame? Is there a way I can choose? 
I'm juggling on a rope without a net and hope, 
I keep my balance 'cos I see them smile with open jaws, 
And if I'm falling down, then I will soon be torn. 
A squabble over prey: who gets the best part out of me, 
To take the needle is a one way trip without a coming back, 
You take it and you still will see reality'll make upon you

YOUR TURN

 Now there is this day, a lot of things are changing 
Can't just kick it away, got to get things right 
Sometimes it happens fast and nothin' seems to last 
The thing that I once started isn't mine anymore 
I guess now it's my turn 
 
You've got a face like a child, got a mind like a woman 
Your smile is warm and tender 
I hear the people say that I should stay away 
From you and all the problems you might bring 
They'll never know you 
Nobody ever knows what to do 
They'll never see you cry 
They'll never know why 
 
Now it's your turn to break free 
When you want it all you've got to see 
Now it's your turn to break free 
When you want the life, you've got to see what it means 
 
See the little boy holding mama's hand 
His eyes can see the things we've long forgotten 
The world is easy now and somehow 
He's right 
Until there is this day when Mickey Mouse must go away 
 
It's your turn to break free. . . 
 
This world is crying to be free 
This world is dying can't you see 
We need a turn to do it right 
We need a mind revolution 
To get away from this selfishness 
Stop playing blind break free
