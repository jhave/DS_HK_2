ANYTHING FOR YOU

 I'd give anything to give me to you 
Can you forget the world that you thought you knew 
If you want me, 
Come and find me 
Nothing's stopping you so please release me 
 
I'll believe 
All your lies 
Just pretend you love me 
Make believe 
Close your eyes 
I'll be anything for you 
 
Have you left to make me feel anymore 
There's only you and everyday I need more 
If you want me 
Come and find me 
I'll do anything you say just tell me 
 
I'll believe 
All your lies 
Just pretend you love me 
Make believe 
Close your eyes 
I'll be anything for you 
 
I'll believe 
All your lies 
Just pretend you love me 
Make believe 
Close your eyes 
I'll be anything for you 
 
Anything for you 
All without your hurt inside 
Will never, never die 
I'll be everything you need 
 
I'll believe 
All your lies 
Just pretend you love me 
Make believe 
Close your eyes 
I'll be anything for you

 

EVANESCENCE
ANYWHERE

 Dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me 
And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free 
I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you 
And at sweet night, you are my own 
Take my hand 
 
CHORUS: 
We're leaving here tonight 
There's no need to tell anyone 
They'd only hold us down 
So by the morning light 
We'll be half way to anywhere 
Where love is more than just your name 
 
I have dreamt of a place for you and I 
No one knows who we are there 
All I want is to give my life only to you 
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore 
Let's run away, I'll take you there 
 
Chorus 
 
Forget this life 
Come with me 
Don't look back you're safe now 
Unlock your heart 
Drop your guard 
No one's left to stop you 
 
Forget this life 
Come with me 
Don't look back you're safe now 
Unlock your heart 
Drop your guard 
No one's left to stop you now 
 
Chorus

 

EVANESCENCE
AWAY FROM ME

 I hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll 
I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds 
But oh, God, I feel I've been lied to 
Lost all faith in the things I have achieved 
And I 
 
CHORUS: 
I've woken now to find myself 
In the shadows of all I have created 
I'm longing to be lost in you 
(away from this place I have made) 
Won't you take me away from me 
 
Crawling through this world as disease flows through my veins 
I look into myself, but my own heart has been changed 
I can't go on like this 
I loathe all I've become 
 
Chorus 
 
Lost in a dying world I reach for something more 
I have grown so weary of this lie I live 
 
Chorus

 

EVANESCENCE
BREATHE NO MORE

 I've been looking in the mirror for so long. 
That I've come to believe my souls on the other side. 
Oh the little pieces falling, shatter. 
Shards of me, 
To sharp to put back together. 
To small to matter, 
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces. 
If I try to touch her, 
And I bleed, 
I bleed, 
And I breathe, 
I breathe no more. 
 
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well. 
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child. 
Lie to me, 
Convince me that I've been sick forever. 
And all of this, 
Will make sense when I get better. 
I know the difference, 
Between myself and my reflection. 
I just can't help but to wonder, 
Which of us do you love. 
So I bleed, 
I bleed, 
And I breathe, 
I breathe now... 
Bleed, 
I bleed, 
And I breathe, 
I breathe, 
I breathe 
I breathe no more. 
 


 

EVANESCENCE
BRING ME TO LIFE

 (feat. Paul McCoy) 
 
How can you see into my eyes 
like open doors. 
Leading you down into my core 
where I've become so numb. 
Without a soul 
my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold 
until you find it there and lead it back home. 
 
(Wake me up. 
Wake me up inside. 
I can't wake up. 
Wake me up inside. 
Save me. 
Call my name and save me from the dark. 
Wake me up. 
Bid my blood to run. 
I can't wake up. 
Before I come undone. 
Save me. 
Save me from the nothing I've become.) 
 
Now that I know what I'm without 
you can't just leave me. 
Breathe into me and make me real 
Bring me to life. 
 
Chorus 
 
Bring me to life. 
I've been living a lie 
There's nothing inside. 
Bring me to life. 
 
Frozen inside without your touch, 
without your love, darling. 
Only you are the life among the dead. 
 
All of this sight 
I can't believe I couldn't see 
Kept in the dark 
but you were there in front of me 
 
I've been sleeping a 1000 years it seems. 
I've got to open my eyes to everything. 
 
Without a thought 
Without a voice 
Without a soul 
 
Don't let me die here 
There must be something wrong. 
Bring me to life. 
 
Chorus 
 
Bring me to life. 
I've been living a lie 
There's nothing inside. 
 
Bring me to life

 

EVANESCENCE
ETERNAL

 

 

EVANESCENCE
EVEN IN DEATH

 Give me a reason to believe that you're gone 
I see your shadow so I know they're all wrong 
Moonlight on the soft brown earth 
It leads me to where you lay 
They took you away from me but now I'm taking you home 
 
CHORUS: 
I will stay forever here with you 
My love 
The softly spoken words you gave me 
Even in death our love goes on 
 
Some say I'm crazy for my love, Oh my love 
But no bonds can hold me from your side, Oh my love 
They don't know you can't leave me 
They don't hear you singing to me 
 
Chorus 
 
And I can't love you, anymore than I do 


 

EVANESCENCE
EVERYBODY'S FOOL

 Perfect by nature, icons of self indulgence 
Just what we all need 
More lies about a world 
 
That never was and never will be 
Have you no shame, don't you see me? 
You know you've got everybody fooled. 
 
Look here she comes now 
Bow down and stare in wonder. 
Oh, how we love you 
No flaws when you're 
But now I know she 
 
Never was and never will be 
You don't know how you betrayed me 
And somehow you've got everybody fooled. 
 
Without the mask 
Where will you hide? 
Can't find yourself, 
Lost in your lies 
 
I know the truth now 
I know who you are 
And I don't love you anymore 
 
Never was and never will be 
You don't know how you betrayed me 
And somehow you've got everybody fooled. 
 
Never was and never will be 
Not for real that you can save me 
And somehow now you're everybody's fool. 


 

EVANESCENCE
EXODUS

 My black backpack's stuffed with broken dreams 
20 bucks should get me through the week 
Never said a word of discontentment 
Fought it a thousand times but now 
I'm leaving home 
 
CHORUS: 
Here in the shadows 
I'm safe 
I'm free 
I've nowhere else to go but 
I cannot stay where I don't belong 
 
Two months pass by and it's getting cold 
I know I'm not lost 
I am just alone 
But I won't cry 
I won't give up 
I can't go back now 
Waking up is knowing who you really are 
 
Chorus 
 
Chorus 
 
Show me the shadow where true meaning lies 
So much more is made in empty eyes

FARTHER AWAY

 I took their smiles and I made them mine. 
I,I sold my soul just to hide the light. 
And now I see what I really am, 
A thief a whore, and a liar. 
I run to you, 
Call out your name, 
I see you there, father away. 
 
Im numb to you numb and deaf and blind. 
You give me all but the reason why. 
I reach but I feel only air at night. 
Not you, not love, just nothing. 
I run to you, 
Call out your name, 
I see you there, father away. 
 
Try to forget you, 
But without you I feel nothing. 
Don't leave me here, by myself. 
I can't breathe. 
I run to you, 
Call out your name, 
I see you there, father away. 
 
I run to you, 
Call out your name, 
I see you there, father away, 
Farther away, 
Father away, 
Father away, 
Father away, 
Father away.

EVANESCENCE
FIELD OF INNOCENCE

 I still remember the world 
From the eyes of a child 
Slowly those feelings 
Were clouded by what I know now 
 
Where has my heart gone 
An uneven trade for the real world 
I want to go back to 
Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all 
 
I still remember the sun 
Always warm on my back 
Somehow it seems colder now 
 
Where has my heart gone 
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger 
I want to go back to 
Believing in everything 
 
[Latin hymn] 


 

EVANESCENCE
FORGIVE ME

 Can you forgive me again? 
I don't know what I said 
But I didn't mean to hurt you 
 
I heard the words come out 
I felt like I would die 
It hurt so much to hurt you 
 
Then you look at me 
You're not shouting anymore 
You're silently broken 
 
I'd give anything now 
to hear those words from you 
 
Each time I say something I regret I cry I don't want to lose you. 
But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah. 
 
'Cause you were made for me 
Somehow I'll make you see 
How happy you make me 
 
I can't live this life 
Without you by my side 
I need you to survive 
 
So stay with me 
You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside that I'm sorry. 
 
And you forgive me again 
You're my one true friend 
And I never meant to hurt you 


 

EVANESCENCE
GIVE UNTO ME

 I've been watching you from a distance 
The distance sees through your disguise 
All I want from you is your hurting 
I want to heal you 
I want to save you from the dark 
 
Give unto me your troubles 
I'll endure your suffering 
Place onto me your burden 
I'll drink your deadly poison 
 
Why should I care if they hurt you 
Somehow it matters more to me 
Than if I were hurting myself 
Save you (save you) 
I'll save you 
 
Give unto me your troubles 
I'll endure your suffering 
Place onto me your burden 
I'll drink your deadly poison 
 
Fear not the flame of my love's candle 
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness 
Give unto me all that frightens you 
I'll have your nightmares for you 
If you sleep soundly 
 
Give unto me your troubles 
I'll endure your suffering 
Place onto me your burden 
I'll drink your deadly poison 
 
Fear not the flame of my love's candle 
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness 
Give unto me all that frightens you 
I'll have your nightmares for you 
If you sleep soundly 
 
Fear not the flame of my love's candle 
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness

 

EVANESCENCE
GOING UNDER

 Now I will tell you what I've done for you 
50 thousand tears I've cried 
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you 
and you still won't hear me 
Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself 
Maybe I'll wake up for once 
Not tormented daily defeated by you 
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom 
I'm dying again 
 
 
I'm going under 
Drowning in you 
I'm falling forever 
I've got to break through 
I'm going under 
 
 
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies 
so I don't know what's real and what's not 
always confusing the thoughts in my head 
so I can't trust myself anymore 
I'm dying again 
 
 
I'm going under 
Drowning in you 
I'm falling forever 
I've got to break through 
 
 
So go on and scream 
Scream at me I m so far away 
I won't be broken again 
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under. 


 

EVANESCENCE
GOODNIGHT

 Goodnight, sleep tight 
No more tears 
Goodnight morning, I'll be here 
And when we say goodnight, 
Dry your eyes 
Because we said goodnight, 
And now goodbye 
We said goodnight 
And now goodbye 


 

EVANESCENCE
HAUNTED

 No lost words, whisper slowey, to me. 
Still can't find what keeps me here. 
And all this time I've been so hollow, inside, 
(I know your still there). 
 
Watching me, 
Wanting me, 
I can feel you haunt me down. 
Fearing you, 
Loving you, 
I know I'll find you somehow. 
 
Haunting you, I can smell you, a ?? 
Your heart pounding in my head ! 
 
Wanting me, 
Fearing me, 
I won't let you haunt me down. 
Deciving me, 
Bringing me, 
Watching me ! 
 
Watching me, 
Haunting me, 
I can fear you haunt me down. 
Fearing you, 
Loving you, 
I won't let you haunt me down. 
Watching me, 
Wanting me, 
I can feel you haunt me down. 
Fearing you, 
Loving you, 
I won't let you haunt me down.

 

EVANESCENCE
HELLO

 Playground schoolbell rings, again 
Rainclouds come to play, again 
Has no one told you she's not breathing ? 
Hello, I'm your mind, giving you someone to talk to...Hello... 
If I smile and don't believe 
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream 
Don't try to fix me 
I'm not broken 
Hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide... 
*Don't cry...* 
Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping 
Hello, I'm still here, all that's left 
Of yesterday... 


 

EVANESCENCE
I MUST BE DREAMING

 How can I pretend that I don't see 
What you hide so carelessly? 
I saw her bleed 
You heard me breathe 
So I froze inside myself 
And turned away 
I must be dreaming 
 
We all live 
We all die 
That does not begin to justtify you 
 
It's not what it seems 
Not what you think 
No I must be dreaming 
It's only in my mind 
Not in real life 
No I must be dreaming 
 
Help you know I've got to tell someone 
Tell them what I know you've done 
I fear you but spoken fears can come true 
 
We all live 
We all die 
That does not begin to justtify you 
 
It's not what it seems 
Not what you think 
No I must be dreaming 
It's only in my mind 
Not in real life 
No I must be dreaming 
 
Not what it seems 
Not what you think 
I must be dreaming 
 
Just in my mind 
Not in real life 
I must be dreaming

 

EVANESCENCE
IMAGINARY

 Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming 
Cannot cease for the fear 
Of silent nights 
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming 
The goddess of imaginary light 
 
CHORUS: 
In my field of paper flowers 
And candy clouds of lullaby 
I lie inside myself for hours 
And watch my purple sky fly over me 
 
I linger in the doorway 
Of alarm clock screaming monsters 
Calling my name 
Let me stay 
Where the wind will whisper to me 
Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story 
 
Chorus 
 
If you need to leave the world you live in 
Lay your head down and stay a while 
Though you may not remember dreaming 
Something waits for you to breathe again

EVANESCENCE
LIES

 Bound at every limb by my shackles of fear 
Sealed with lies through so many tears 
Lost from within, pursuing the end 
I fight for the chance to be lied to again 
 
You will never be strong enough 
You will never be good enough 
You were never conceived in love 
You will not rise above 
 
CHORUS: 
They'll never see 
I'll never be 
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger 
Burning deep inside of me 
 
But through my tears breaks a blinding light 
Birthing a dawn to this endless night 
Arms outstretched, awaiting me 
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree 
 
Rest in me and I'll comfort you 
I have lived and I died for you 
Abide in me and I vow to you 
I will never forsake you 
 
Chorus

EVANESCENCE
MISSING

 Please, please forgive me, 
But I won't be home again. 
Maybe someday you'll have woke up, 
And, barely conscious, you'll say to no one: 
 Isn't something missing? 
 
You won't cry for my absence, I know 
You forgot me long ago. 
Am I that unimportant...? 
Am I so insignificant...? 
Isn't something missing? 
Isn't someone missing me? 
 
Chorus 
Even though I'd be sacrificed, 
You won't try for me, not now. 
Though I'd die to know you love me, 
I'm all alone. 
Isn't someone missing me? 
 
Please, please forgive me, 
But I won't be home again. 
I know what you do to yourself, 
Shudder deep and cry out: 
 Isn't something missing? 
Isn't someone missing me? 
 
Chorus 
 
And if I bleed, I'll bleed, 
Knowing you don't care. 
And if I sleep just to dream of you 
And wake without you there, 
Isn't something missing? 
Isn't something... 
 
Chorus

 

EVANESCENCE
MY IMMORTAL

 I'm so tired of being here 
Suppressed by all my childish fears 
And if you have to leave 
I wish that you would just leave 
'Cause your presence still lingers here 
And it won't leave me alone 
 
These wounds won't seem to heal 
This pain is just too real 
There's just too much that time cannot erase 
 
CHORUS: 
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears 
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears 
I held your hand through all of these years 
But you still have 
All of me 
 
You used to captivate me 
By your resonating life 
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind 
Your face it haunts 
My once pleasant dreams 
Your voice it chased away 
All the sanity in me 
 
These wounds won't seem to heal 
This pain is just too real 
There's just too much that time cannot erase 
 
Chorus 
 
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone 
But though you're still with me 
I've been alone all along

MY LAST BREATH

 Hold on to me love 
You know I can't stay long 
All I wanted to say was 
I love you and I'm not afraid 
 
Can you hear me? 
Can you feel me in your arms 
Holding my last breath? 
Safe inside myself 
Are all my thoughts of you 
 
Sweet rapture and life, 
It ends here tonight. 
 
I'll miss the winter 
A world of fragile things 
Look for me in the white forest 
Hiding in a hollow tree 
 
I know you hear me, 
I can taste it in your tears. 
Holding my last breath 
Safe inside myself 
Are all my thoughts of you. 
 
Sweet rapture and life, 
It ends here tonight. 
 
Closing your eyes 
You pray your dreams will leave you here, 
But still you wake and know the truth 
No one's there. 
 
Say goodnight, don't be afraid 
Calling me, holding me, as you fade to black. 
 
(Say goodnight) Holding my last breath 
(Don't be afraid) Safe inside myself 
(Holding me) Are my thoughts of you 
Sweet rapture and life, 
It ends here tonight. 


 

EVANESCENCE
OCTOBER

 I can't run anymore, 
I fall before you, 
Here I am, 
I have nothing left, 
Though I've tried to forget, 
You're all that I am, 
Take me home, 
I'm through fighting it, 
Broken, 
Lifeless, 
I give up, 
You're my only strength, 
Without you, 
I can't go on, 
Anymore, 
Ever again. 
 
My only hope, 
(All the times I've tried) 
My only peace, 
(To walk away from you) 
My only joy, 
My only strength, 
(I fall into your abounding grace) 
My only power, 
My only life, 
(And love is where I am) 
My only love. 
 
I can't run anymore, 
I give myself to you, 
I'm sorry, 
I'm sorry, 
In all my bitterness, 
I ignored, 
All that's real and true, 
All I need is you, 
When night falls on me, 
I'll not close my eyes, 
I'm too alive, 
And you're too strong, 
I can't lie anymore, 
I fall down before you, 
I'm sorry, 
I'm sorry. 
 
My only hope, 
(All the times I've tried) 
My only peace, 
(To walk away from you) 
My only joy, 
My only strength, 
(I fall into your abounding grace) 
My only power, 
My only life, 
(And love is where I am) 
My only love. 
 
Constantly ignoring, 
The pain consuming me, 
But this time it's cut too deep, 
I'll never stray again. 
 
My only hope, 
(All the times I've tried) 
My only peace, 
(To walk away from you) 
My only joy, 
My only strength, 
(I fall into your abounding grace) 
My only power, 
My only life, 
(And love is where I am) 
My only love, 
My only hope, 
(All the times I've tried) 
My only peace, 
(To walk away from you) 
My only joy, 
My only strength, 
(I fall into your abounding grace) 
My only power, 
My only life, 
(And love is where I am)

EVANESCENCE
SO CLOSE

 I've spent so much time throwing rocks at your window 
That I never even knocked on the front door 
 
I walk by statues every evening watching you? 
But if I can give you ??? 
I just might lay myself down for a little more than I had the last day 
 
Wait a time to spare these lies we tell ourselves 
These days have come and gone 
But this time is sweeter than honey 
 


 

EVANESCENCE
SO CLOSE

 I've spent so much time throwing rocks at your window 
That I never even knocked on the front door 
 
I walk by statues never even made one chip 
but if i could leave a mark on the monument of the heart 
I just might lay myself down for a little more than I had the last day 
 
Wait a time to spare these lies we tell ourselves 
These days have come and gone 
But this time is sweeter than honey 


 

EVANESCENCE
SOLITUDE

 How many times have you told me you love her 
As many times as I've wanted to tell you the truth 
How long have I stood here beside you 
I live through you 
You looked through me 
 
Ooh, Solitude, 
Still with me is only you 
Ooh, Solitude, 
I can't stay away from you 
 
How many times have I done this to myself 
How long will it take before I see 
When will this hole in my heart be mended 
Who now is left alone but me 
 
Ooh, Solitude, 
Forever me and forever you 
Ooh, Solitude, 
Only you, only true 
 
Everyone leave me stranded 
Forgotten, abandoned, left behind 
I can't stay here another night 
 
Your secret in my heart 
Who could it be 
 
Ooh, Can't you see 
All along it was me 
How can you be so blind 
As to see right through me 
 
And Ooh, Solitude, 
Still with me is only you 
Ooh, Solitude, 
I can't stay away from you 
 
Ooh, Solitude, 
Forever me and forever you 
Ooh, Solitude, 
Only you, only true 


 

EVANESCENCE

Still with me is only you 
Ooh, Solitude,

EVANESCENCE
TAKING ME OVER

 

EVANESCENCE
TAKING OVER ME

 You don't remember me but i remember you 
i lie awake and try so hard not to think of you 
but who can decide what they dream? 
and dream i do... 
 
i believe in you 
i'll give up everything just to find you 
i have to be with you to live to breathe 
you're taking over me 
 
have you forgotten all i know 
and all we had? 
you saw me mourning my love for you 
and touched my hand 
i knew you loved me then 
 
i believe in you 
i'll give up everything just to find you 
i have to be with you to live to breathe 
you're taking over me 
 
i look in the mirror and see your face 
if i look deep enough 
so many things inside that are just like you are taking over

 

EVANESCENCE
THE END

 

 

EVANESCENCE
TOURNIQUET

 I tried to kill the pain, 
But only brought more. 
(So much more) 
I'm dying, 
And I'm pouring, crimson regret, and betrayal. 
 
I'm dying, 
Praying, 
Bleeding, 
Screaming. 
Am I too lost to be saved ? 
Am I too lost ? 
My God! My Tourniquet, 
Return to me salvation. 
My God! My Tourniquet, 
Return to me salvation. 
 
Do you remember me ? 
Lost for so long. 
Will you be on the other side ? 
Will you forgive me ? 
 
I'm dying, 
Praying, 
Bleeding, 
Screaming. 
 
Am I too lost to be saved ? 
Am I too lost ? 
 
My God! My Tourniquet, 
Return to me salvation. 
My God! My Tourniquet, 
Return to me salvation. 
 
(Return to me salvation) 
(I want to DIE!) 
 
My God! My Tourniquet, 
Return to me salvation. 
My God! My Tourniquet, 
Return to me salvation. 
 
My wounds cry for the grave. 
My soul cries, for deliverance. 
Will I be denied ? 
Christ! Tourniquet! My suicide. 


 

EVANESCENCE
UNDERSTANDING (SOUND ASLEEP)

 The pain that grips you 
The fear that binds you 
Releases life in me 
In our mutual shame we hide our eyes 
To blind them from the truth that finds a way to who we are 
 
Please don't be afraid 
When the darkness fades away 
The dawn will break the silence screaming at our hearts 
My love for you still grows 
This I do for you 
Before I try to fight the truth my final time 
 
 
Can't wash it all away 
Can't wish it all away 
Can't cry it all away 
Can't scratch it all away 
 
Lying beside you 
Listening to you breathe 
The light that flows inside of you burns inside of me 
Hold and speak to me 
Of love without a sound 
Tell me you will live through this and I will die for you 
Cast me not away 
Say you'll be with me 
For I know I cannot bear it all alone 
 
Can't fight it all away 
Can't hope it all away 
Can't scream it all away 
It just won't fade away 
 


 

EVANESCENCE
UNDERSTANDING (WASH IT ALL AWAY)

 You hold the answers deep within your own mind. 
Consciously, you've forgotten it. 
That's the way the human mind works. 
Whenever something is too unpleasant, to shameful for us 
to entertain, we reject it. 
We erase it from our memories. 
But the answer is always there. 
 
(Can't wash it all away) 
(Can't Wish it all away) 
(Can't hope it all away) 
(Can't cry it all away) 
 
The pain that grips you 
The fear that binds you 
Releases life in me 
In our mutual 
Shame we idolize 
To blind them from the truth 
That finds a way from who we are 
Please don't be afraid 
When the darkness fades away 
The dawn will break the silence 
Screaming in our hearts 
My love for you still grows 
This I do for you 
Before I try to fight the truth my final time 
 
 We're supposed to try and be real. 
And I feel alone, and we're not together. And that is real. 
 
Can't wash it all away 
Can't wish it all away 
Can't cry it all away 
Can't scratch it all away 
 
Lying beside you 
Listening to you breathe 
The life that flows inside of you 
Burns inside of me 
Hold and speak to me 
Of love without a sound 
Tell me you will live through this 
And I will die for you 
Cast me not away 
Say you'll be with me 
For I know I cannot 
Bear it all alone 
 
 You're not alone, are you? 
 Never... Never. 
 
Can't fight it all away 
Can't hope it all away 
Can't scream it all away 
It just won't fade away, No 
 
Can't wash it all away 
Can't wish it all away 
Can't cry it all away 
Can't scratch it all away 
 
(Can't fight it all away) 
(Can't hope it all away) 
Can't scream it all away 
Ooh, it all away 
Ooh, it all away 
 
 But the answer is always there. Nothing is ever really forgotten. 
 Because I'm tired of it too. 
 Because I'm tired of it too. 
 Because I'm tired of it too. 
 Because I'm tired of it too. 
 Because I'm tired of it too. 


 

EVANESCENCE
UNDERSTANDING (WASH IT ALL AWAY)

 You hold the answer deep within your own mind. Consciously you've forgotten it. That's the way the human mind words. Whenver something is too unpleasant, too shameful for us to entertain we reject it, we erase it from our memory, but the imprint is always there. 
 
We wash it all away, we wish it all away, we hope it all away, we ??? it all away. 
 
The pain that grips you 
The fear that binds you 
Releases life in me 
In our mutual shame we hide our eyes 
To blind them from the truth that finds a way to who we are

Can't hope it all away 
Can't scream it all away 
It just won't fade away 
 
Can't wash it all away 
Can't wish it all away 
Can't throw it all away 
Can't scratch it all away 
 
Can't fight it all away 
Can't hope it all away 
Can't scream it all away 
? it all away 
? it all away 
 
But the imprint is always there, nothing is ever really forgotten 
 
Because I'm dying too, 
because I'm dying too, 
because I'm dying too, 
because I'm dying too, 
because I'm dying too

WHERE WILL YOU GO

 You re too important for anyone 
You play the role of all you want to be 
But I, I know who you really are 
You re the one who cries when you re alone 
 
CHORUS 
But where will you go 
With no one left to save you from yourself 
You can t escape 
You can t escape 
 
You think that I can t see right through your eyes 
Scared to death to face reality 
No one seems to hear your hidden cries 
You re left to face yourself alone 
 
Chorus 
 
I realize you re afraid 
But you can t abandon everyone 
You can t escape 
You don t want to escape 
 
I m so sick of speaking words that no one understands 
Is it clear enough that you can t live your whole life all alone 
I can hear you in a whisper 
But you can t even hear me screaming 
 
Chorus 
 
I realize you re afraid 
But you can t reject the whole world 
You can t escape 
You won t escape 
You can t escape 
You don t want to escape

EVANESCENCE
WHISPER

 Catch me as I fall 
Say you're here and it's all over now 
Speaking to the atmosphere 
No one's here and I fall into myself 
This truth drive me 
Into madness 
I know I can stop the pain 
If I will it all away 
 
CHORUS 
Don't turn away 
(Don't give in to the pain) 
Don't try to hide 
(Though they're screaming your name) 
Don't close your eyes 
(God knows what lies behind them) 
Don't turn out the light 
(Never sleep never die) 
 
I'm frightened by what I see 
But somehow I know 
That there's much more to come 
Immobilized by my fear 
And soon to be 
Blinded by tears 
I can stop the pain 
If I will it all away 
 
Chorus 
 
Fallen angels at my feet 
Whispered voices at my ear 
Death before my eyes 
Lying next to me I fear 
She beckons me 
Shall I give in 
Upon my end shall I begin 
Forsaking all I've fallen for 
I rise to meet my end 
 
Chorus
