DEDICATED

 I have a dream of a scene between the green hills 
Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed 
People don't talk about keeping it real 
It's understood that they actually will 
And intoxicated and stimulated emcees 
Staring in the trees, paranoid, are gone in the breeze 
Watch them flee, hip hop hits 
Take a walk with me and what you'll see 
Is a land where the sand is made up of crushed up wax 
And the sky beyond you is krylon glue 
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme 
And emcees have left materialism behind them 
Meanwhile I just grip my mic 
And hope me and my team make it through alright 
Because say what you will, and say what you might 
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night 
 
[CHORUS] 
Because this is dedicated to the kids 
Dedicated to wherever music lives 
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same 
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game 
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong 
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong 
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run 
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun 
 
I've seen a lot of shit, I've talked to a bum 
Out on sunset strip, he asked me How would you feel 
If everybody acted like you didn't exist 
You'd lose your grip, probably eventually flip. 
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this 
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it 
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonest 
Be floatin overhead like a space odyssey monolith 
Over seeing the game, over being part of the same ol' thing 
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain 
And acidic rain and promises that you won't do it again 
Meanwhile I just grip my mic 
And hope me and my team make it through alright 
Because say what you will, and say what you might 
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside 
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide 
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside 
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide 
 
[Chorus] 
 
This is dedicated to the kids 
Dedicated to wherever music lives 
Dedicated to those tired of the same ol' same 
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game 
What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe 
What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place 
What's real, anybody with nowhere to run 
Who hides in the shadows waiting for the sun

DON'T STAY

 Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe 
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me 
Sometimes I m in disbelief I didn t know 
Somehow I need you to go 
 
Don t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
What you were changing me into 
Just give me myself back and 
Don t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
Take all your faithlessness with you 
Just give me myself back and 
Don t stay 
 
Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well 
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself 
Sometimes I m in disbelief I didn t know 
Somehow I need to be alone 
 
Don t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
What you were changing me into 
Just give me myself back and 
Don t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
Take all your faithlessness with you 
Just give me myself back and 
Don t stay 
 
I don t need you anymore, I don t want to be ignored 
I don t need one more day of you wasting me away 
I don t need you anymore, I don t want to be ignored 
I don t need one more day of you wasting me away 
With no apologies 
 
Don t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
What you were changing me into 
Just give me myself back and 
Don t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
Take all your faithlessness with you 
Just give me myself back and 
Don t stay

DRAG

 I'm drowning 
Make me feel 
Like I am real 
Torture me 
Drag me under you 
 
Time 
Lifts me up and down 
Time 
Makes me 
SHUT UP 
 
Life is much too short to be 
Intoxicated 
Life is much too short to be 
A drag 
 
Please treat me 
Like I am a fallen angel 
Surpress me 
Tell me 
LIES 
 
Life is much too short to be 
Intoxicated 
Life is much too short to be 
A drag 
 
You can't tell me 
 
Life is much too short to be 
Intoxicated 
Life is much too short to be 
A DRAG 
 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

EASIER TO RUN

 It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
 
Something has been taken from deep inside of me 
The secret I've kept locked away no one can ever see 
Wounds so deep they never show they never go away 
Like moving pictures in my head for years and years they've played 
 
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would) 
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) 
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would) 
(If I could take all the shame to the grave I would) 
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would) 
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) 
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would) 
(I would take all my shame to the grave) 
 
[Chorus] 
It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something more 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
 
Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past 
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have 
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back 
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past 
 
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would) 
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) 
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would) 
(If I could take all the shame to the grave I would) 
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would) 
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) 
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would) 
(I would take all my shame to the grave) 
 
Just washing it aside 
All of the helplessness inside 
Pretending I don't feel misplaced 
It's so much simpler than change 
 
[Chorus] 
It's easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something more 
It's so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone 
 
It's easier to run 
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would) 
(Retrace every wrong move that I made) 
It's easier to go 
(If I could change I would take back the pain I would) 
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) 
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would) 
(I would take all my shame to the grave)

 (feat. Kutmasta Kurt, Motion Man) 
 
Hey, yo 
When this first started off 
It was just Linkin Park 
And then in the middle 
Came Motion Man 
And at the end of it all 
It was Kutmasta Kurt 
With a remix 
 
One thing, I don t know why 
It doesn t even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time 
All I know, time was just slipping away 
And I watched it count down to the end of the day 
Watched it watch me and the words that I say 
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins 
I know that I didn t look out below 
And I watched the time go right out the window 
Tried to grab hold 
Tried not to watch 
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock 
But in the end, no matter what I pretend 
The journey is more important than the end or the start 
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter 
 
Hey, yo 
One thing, I don t know why 
It doesn t even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time 
All I know, hah, I so socialse 
Like the host of the party 
I spoke, shaked, and made eye contact 
Partied and toasted strong, all that 
Northeast, Southwest coast 
I m staring out the window 
No oppourtunity to mingle 
I tried to sew it up to weaken your system 
I had you throwing up 
I brought you back into things 
Like the imaginary man of your dreams 
You d always seem to make it worth it 
I picked skin, I never nursed it 
You felt like loving, never played real 
I m bringing the pleasure 
By any means it means I m leaving your team 
Hell of a team, man it seems I tried so hard 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter

In the end

Remix 
 
One thing, I don t know how 
It doesn t even matter when you look at it now 
 Cause when I designed this rhyme 
I was scared of it all, scared to fall, and I hadn t even tried to crawl 
But I was forced to run with you mocking me, stopping me, backstabbing me constantly 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
Watch the clock now chock full of hipocrisy 
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale 
Every single little thing you said to make things fail 
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece 
But it really doesn t matter to me 
 Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend 
The journey is more important than the end or the start 
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard 
 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter 
 
In the end

ESAUL (A PLACE FOR MY HEAD)

 Riding with a head full of bodies are red 
And when this x is still stuck in my head 
But misled doing the things I do would make you never wanna come back 
But an all front attack, so you could never run from that 
Being trapped in this beau, some that I never wanted to do 
But through it all you've got to see that what I want to be 
Is over the pen again letting it out of me 
In the center of the day in the dream, seeing all my thoughts 
Getting lost in between, realizing one that the way to the sea 
And the killing and again are in the head with the screams 
 
I wanna live in another place 
Where no one can say that I live for them 
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
 
We're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart 
Going in the hollow, hoping that you won't know 
The strain it puts to me, seeing what you've done 
And consequently I've run away, just hitting again 
Within the boundaries of an anguish 
Want me to say this, but you're dragging me down 
Lost in the chaos being tossed around 
 
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic 
Hope that some day you'll regret this 
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time 
Adding to the panic of my confine 
 
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic 
Hope that some day you'll regret this 
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time 
Adding to the panic of my confine 
I wanna live in another place 
Where no one can say that I live for them 
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
 
You 
Try to take the best of me 
Go away 
 
You 
Try to take the best of me 
Go away 
 
You 
Try to take the best of me 
Go away 
 
You 
Try to take the best of me 
GO AWAY 
 
You 
Try to take the best of me, go away 
You 
Try to take the best of me, go away 
You 
Try to take the best of me, go away 
You 
Try to take the best of me, go away 
 
I wanna live in another place 
Where no one can say that I live for them 
Start seeing it's not meant 
To be for me 
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
 
SHUT!! 
 
UP!! 
 
WHY!! 
 
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic 
Hope that some day you'll regret this 
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time 
Adding to the panic of my confine

FAINT

 I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard 
Handful of complaints but I can t help the fact that everybody can see 
these scars 
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel 
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe 
this is real 
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got 
 
[Chorus] 
(I can't feel the way I did before) 
(Don't turn your back on me) 
(I won't be ignored) 
(Time won't heal this damage anymore) 
(Don't turn your back on me) 
(I won't be ignored) 
 
I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident 
Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make 
sense 
I am what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt 
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear 
me out 
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got 
 
[Chorus] 
(I can't feel the way I did before) 
(Don't turn your back on me) 
(I won't be ignored) 
(Time won't heal this damage anymore) 
(Don't turn your back on me) 
(I won't be ignored) 
 
(No) 
(Hear me out now) 
(You're gonna listen to me, like it or not) 
(Right now) 
(Hear me out now) 
(You're gonna listen to me, like it or not) 
(Right now) 
 
(I can't feel the way I did before) 
(Don't turn your back on me) 
(I won't be ignored) 
 
[Chorus] 
(I can't feel the way I did before) 
(Don't turn your back on me) 
(I won't be ignored) 
(Time won't heal this damage anymore) 
(Don't turn your back on me) 
(I won't be ignored) 
 
[Chorus] 
(I can't feel the way I did before) 
(Don't turn your back on me) 
(I won't be ignored) 
(Time won't heal this damage anymore) 
(Don't turn your back on me) 
(I won't be ignored) 
 
I can't feel 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored

FIGURE.09

 Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them 
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening 
It's like nothing I can do would distract me when 
I think of how I shot myself in the back again 
Cuz from the infinite words I can say I 
Put all pain you gave to me on display 
But didn't realize instead of setting it free I 
Took what I hated and made it a part of me 
 
(Never goes away) 
(Never goes away) 
 
[Chorus] 
(And now) 
(You've become a part of me) 
(You'll always be right here) 
(You've become a part of me) 
(You'll always be my fear) 
(I can't separate) 
(Myself from what I've done) 
(Giving up a part of me) 
(I've let myself become you) 
 
Hearing your name the memories come back again 
I remember when it started happening 
I see you in every thought I had and then 
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them 
And I knew as they escaped away 
I was committing myself to them and everyday 
I regret saying those things cuz now I see that I 
Took what I hated and made it a part of me 
 
(Never goes away) 
(Never goes away) 
 
[Chorus] 
(And now) 
(You've become a part of me) 
(You'll always be right here) 
(You've become a part of me) 
(You'll always be my fear) 
(I can't separate) 
(Myself from what I've done) 
(Giving up a part of me) 
(I've let myself become you) 
 
(Never goes away) 
(Never goes away) 
(Never goes away) 
(Never goes away) 
 
(Get away from me) 
Give me my space back you gotta just 
(Go) 
Everything comes down the memories of 
(You) 
I kept it in but now I'm letting you 
(Know) 
I let you go so get away from 
(Me) 
Give me my space back you gotta just 
(Go) 
Everything comes down the memories of 
(You) 
I kept it but now I'm letting you 
(Know) 
I let you go 
 
(And then) 
(You've become a part of me) 
(You'll always be right here) 
(You've become a part of me) 
(You'll always be my fear) 
(I can't separate) 
(Myself from what I've done) 
(Giving up a part of me) 
(I've let myself become you)

FORGOTTEN

 From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I ve forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won t escape me 
But why should I care 
[Chorus x2] 
 
There s a place so dark you can t see the end 
Skies cock back and shock that which can t defend 
The rain then sends dripping / acidic question 
Forcefully, the power of suggestion 
Then with the eyes shut / looking thought the rust and rot 
And dust / a small spot of light floods the floor 
And pours over the rusted world of pretend 
The eyes ease open and its dark again 
 
[Chorus x1] 
 
In the memory you ll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 
 
Moving all around / screaming of the ups and downs 
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound 
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps behind 
Street lamps, chain link and concrete 
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn floats 
On down the street till the wind is gone 
The memory now is like the picture was then 
When the paper s crumpled up it can t be perfect again 
 
[Chorus x2] 
 
In the memory you ll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 
 
Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I m telling you that 
I see it right through you 
[x7] 
 
In the memory you ll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up 
[x2]

 

LINKIN PARK
FROM THE INSIDE

 I don t know who to trust no surprise 
(Everyone feels so far away from me) 
Happy thoughts sift through dust and the lies 
(Trying not to break but I m so tired of this deceit) 
(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet) 
(All I ever think about is this) 
(All the tiring time between) 
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me) 
 
[Chorus] 
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away 
Cuz I swear for the last time I won t trust myself with you 
 
Tension is building inside steadily 
(Everyone feels so far away from me) 
heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me 
(Trying not to break but I m so tired of this deceit) 
(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet) 
(All I ever think about is this) 
(All the tiring time between) 
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me) 
 
[Chorus] 
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away 
Cuz I swear for the last time I won t trust myself with you 
 
I won t waste myself on you 
You 
You 
Waste myself on you 
You 
You 
 
I ll take everything from the inside and throw it all away 
Cuz I swear for the last time I won t trust myself with you 
 
Everything from the inside and just throw it all away 
Cuz I swear for the last time I won t trust myself with you 
You

Sometimes 
Hybrid 
 
I ve been digging into crates 
Ever since I was living in space 
Before the ratrace 
Before monkeys had human traits 
I mastered numerology 
And Big Bang theology 
Performed lobotomies 
With telekinetic psychology 
Invented the mic 
So I could start blessing it 
Chin checking kids to make my point like an impressionist 
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I twist mic cords in double helixes 
To show them what I m made of 
I buckle knees like leg braces 
Cast a spell of instrumentalness on all of you emcees who hate us 
So you can try on 
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on 
From now to infinity 
Let icons be bygones 
I fire bomb 
Ghostly notes haunt this 
I tried threats but moved onto a promise 
I stomp s**t with or without an accomplice 
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this 
 
High voltage 
This is the unforgettable sound 
High voltage 
Bringing you up and taking you down 
High voltage 
Coming at you from every side 
High voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 
Akira 
I put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones 
Never satisfied my rhyme jones 
Spraying bright day over what you might say 
My blood type s Krylon, Technicolour Type A 
On highways, right with road rage 
Cages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around 
Surround sound 
Devouring the scene 
Subliminal gangrene paintings 
Overall the same things 
Sing songs, karaoke, copy, bulls**t 
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics 
Fourth dimension, combat convention 
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention 
Meant to put you away 
With the pencil, pistol, official, sixteen line a rhyme missile 
While you risk your all 
I pick out all your flaws 
Spin rah, blah, blah, blah 
You can say you saw

Who s the man demanding you hand over your Land Rover? 
No man s bolder than the Pharoahe when he jams 
The plan s over 
I have fake sclerosis 
The most ferocious 
Why I spy, my third eye, distinctly high voltage 
That s why I need Ruby Quartz glasses 
 Cause when I glance there s a chance I might blast the masses 
Subliminals trasmitted through piano 
Integrated in flow 
Calculated to nano 
I use skills when I need 
Please head the rhyme I hear when I plead when I proceed through time 
I walk through walls an inanimate obsticles 
Via induced reduction of cells and molecules 
I bring the knowledge 
You swallow the state 
That s a hologram 
I box your head 
Fatten your lip like Collogen 
A telepath to deliver verses with no postage

HIGH VOLTAGE (REMIX)

 You know what I mean 
You could put a label on a life, 
Put a label on a lifestyle 
 
Sometimes... 
 
You know 
Put a label on how you wake up every morning 
And go to bed at night 
 
Hybrid 
 
I ve been diggin into crates ever since I was livin in space 
Before the ratrace, before monkeys had human traits 
I mastered numerology and bigbang theology 
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology 
Invented the mic so I could start blessin it 
Chincheckin kids to make my point like an impressionist 
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I twist mic cords in double helixes and show them what I m made of 
I buckle knees like leg braces 
Cast the spell of instrumental ness and all of you emcees who hate us 
So you can try on, 
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on 
From now to infinity let icons be bygones 
I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this 
I tried threats but moved on to a promise 
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice 
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this 
 
High Voltage 
The unforgettable sound 
High Voltage 
Bringing you up and taking you down 
High Voltage 
Coming at you from every side 
High Voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 
Akira, I put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones 
Never satisfy my rhyme jones 
Sprayin bright day over what you might say 
My Blood type's Krylon Technicolor type A 
On highways ride with road rage 
Cages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around 
Surround sound 
Devouring the scene 
Subliminal gangrene paintings 
Over while the same thing 
Sing song karaoke copy bullshit 
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics 
Fourth dimension, combat convention 
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention 
Meant to put you away with the pencil 
Pistol, official, 16 line a rhyme missile 
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws 
Spin rah, blah blah blah 
You can say you saw 
 
High Voltage 
The Unforgettable sound 
High Voltage 
Bringing you up and taking you down 
High Voltage 
Coming at you from every side 
High Voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 
High Voltage 
The Unforgettable sound 
High Voltage 
Bringing you up and taking you down 
High Voltage 
Coming at you from every side 
High Voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide 
 
And like the rock and rap 
You know what i mean 
People act like you know 
Wow that s a new invention 
That shits brand new 
We're constantly evolving 
It is constantly changing 
 
Sometimes... 
 
There's a lot of change 
Everybody's always up with labels 
There ain t no label for this shit 
They're always gonna try to put a label on it 
Try to create something 
So they can water it down 
 
Sometimes I feel like a prophet 
Misunderstood 
Under the gun like a new disease 
 
Sometimes I feel like a prophet 
Misunderstood 
Under the gun like a new disease 
 
High Voltage 
The Unforgettable sound 
High Voltage 
Bringing you up and taking you down 
High Voltage 
Coming at you from every side 
High Voltage 
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

The Unforgettable sound

Bringing you up and taking you down

Coming at you from every side

Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Bringing you up and taking you down 
High Voltage 
Coming at you from every side

HIT THE FLOOR

 There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me 
Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy 
Too many times that I ve held on what I needed to push away 
Afraid to say what was on my mind afraid to say what I need to say 
Too many things that you said about me when I m not around 
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down 
But I ve had too many standoffs with you it s about as much as I can stand 
So I m waiting until the upper hand is mine 
 
[Chorus] 
(One minute you're on top) 
Next you're not watch it drop 
(Making your heart stop) 
Just before you hit the floor 
(One minute you're on top) 
Next you're not missed your shot 
(Making you're heart stop) 
You think you've won 
(And then its all gone) 
 
So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies 
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside 
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long 
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I m not stepped on 
There are so many things you say that make me feel you've crossed the line 
What goes up will surely fall and I m counting down the time 
Cause I ve had so many standoffs with you it s about as much as I can stand 
So I m waiting until the upper hand is mine 
 
[Chorus] 
(One minute you're on top) 
Next you're not watch it drop 
(Making your heart stop) 
Just before you hit the floor 
(One minute you're on top) 
Next you're not missed your shot 
(Making you're heart stop) 
You think you've won 
(And then its all gone) 
(And then it s all gone) 
(And then its all gone) 
(And then it s all gone) 
(Now it s all gone) 
 
I know I ll never trust a single thing you say 
You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway 
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all 
But what goes up has got to fall 
 
[Chorus] 
(One minute you're on top) 
Next you're not watch it drop 
(Making your heart stop) 
Just before you hit the floor 
(One minute you're on top) 
Next you're not missed your shot 
(Making you're heart stop) 
You think you've won 
(And then its all gone) 
(And then it s all gone) 
(And then its all gone) 
(And then it s all gone) 
(Now it s all gone)

IN THE END

 (It starts with) 
One thing / I don t know why 
It doesn t even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
All I know 
time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 
It s so unreal 
Didn t look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on / but didn t even know 
Wasted it all just to 
Watch you go 
I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart 
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried 
so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn't even matter 
One thing / I don t know why 
It doesn t even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme 
To remind myself how 
I tried so hard 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I m surprised it got so (far) 
Things aren t the way they were before 
You wouldn t even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then 
But it all comes back to me 
In the end 
You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart 
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
And for all this 
There s only one thing you should know 
I've put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
And for all this 
There s only one thing you should know 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn t even matter

IT'S GOING DOWN

 (feat. X Ecutioners) 
 
[Woman] 
[Intro] 
I knew I was being threatened 
Do you think it was worth holding out? 
I mean I've heard some pretty ugly things about those guys 
Ugly stories 
 
[X ecutioners] 
Watch them flee...watch them flee 
Rap rap rap up 
Watch them flee 
Hip Hop hits 
And you do it like this 
 
[Mike Shinoda] 
[Verse 1] 
It's going down 
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound 
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now 
Detects the mesh of many elements compressed down 
The melting pot of a super futureesque style 
The combination of vocal caress 
With lungs the gasp for breath 
From emotional stress 
With special effects 
And a distorted collage 
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage 
It's going down 
The logical progression on the timeline 
The seperation narrowed down to a fine line 
To blur the edges so they blend together properly 
Take you on an audible odyssey 
Now it's going down 
A logical progression on the timeline 
The seperation narrowed down to a fine line 
To blur the edges so they blend together properly 
Take you on an audible odyssey 
Now it's going down 
 
[X ecutioners with Mike Shinoda] 
[Chorus] 
Put put...put it up 
I said it goes like this 
And you do it like this 
It's going down 
Put put...put it up 
I said it goes goes like this 
And you do it like this 
It's going down 
 
[Mike Shinoda] 
[Verse 3] 
Once again it is 
Composed sentences 
All together venomous 
The four elements of natural force 
Projected daily through the sound of the source 
Everybody on board as we blend 
The sword with the pen 
The mightiest the weapons 
Swinging right from the chin 
To elevate of mental states 
Long gone with the wind 
To defend men from shoddy imitation pretends 
It's going down 
Stalence emulation readily 
Trekking through the weaponry 
Of the pure pedigree 
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me 
Whatever the weather be 
We invent the steadily 
It's going down sub terrestrial high 
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots 
Exectution of colloborative plots 
Ready to bring the seperation of style to a stop 
 
A logical progression on the timeline 
The seperation narrowed down to a fine line 
To blur the edges so they blend together properly 
Take you on an audible odyssey 
Now it's going down 
 
[X ecutioners with Mike Shinoda] 
[Chorus] 
Put put...put it up 
I said it goes like this 
And you do it like this 
It's going down 
Put put...put it up 
I said it goes like this 
And you do it like this 
It's going down 
 
[X ecutioners] 
X men 'bout to blast off world wide 
Yo it's a request only 
X men 'bout to blast off world wide 
It's built from scratch 
Album in stores soon 
'Bout to blast off world wide 
And you do it like this 
Just like this 
 
[X ecutioners] 
Put put...put it up 
I said it goes like this 
And you do it like this 
It's going down 
Put put...put it up 
I said it goes like this 
And you do it like this 
It's going down

Crawling in my skin 
 
Crawling in my skin 
Without a sence of confidence 
Consuming, confusing 
Crawling in my skin 
Without a sence of confidence 
I m convinced that there s just too much pressure to take 
There s something inside me 
That pulls beneath the surface 
 
Crawling in my skin 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds, they will not heal 
These wounds, they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing, confusing what is real 
Confusing what is real 
 
There s something inside me 
That pulls beneath the surface 
Consuming, confusing 
This lack of self control 
I fear is never ending 
Controlling, I can t seem 
To find myself again 
My walls are closing in 
Without a sence of confidence 
I m convinced that there s just too much pressure to take 
I ve felt this way before 
So insecure 
 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds, they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing what is real 
 
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me 
Distracting, reacting 
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection 
It s haunting 
How I can t seem 
To find myself again 
My walls are closing in 
Without a sence of confidence 
I m convinced that there s just too much pressure to take 
I ve felt this way before 
So insecure 
 
Without a sence of confidence 
Without a sence of confidence 
Without a sence of confidence 
I m convinced that there s just too much pressure to take 
Without a sence of confidence 
Without a sence of confidence 
Without a sence of confidence 
I m convinced that there s just too much pressure to take 
To find myself again 
My walls are closing in 
Without a sence of confidence 
I m convinced that there s just too much pressure to take 
I ve felt this way before 
So insecure 
 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds, they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing what is real 
 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds, they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing what is real

LYING FROM YOU

 When I pretend everything is what I want it to be 
I look exactly like what you always wanted to see 
When I pretend, I can t forget about the criminal I am 
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can but 
I can t pretend this is the way it ll stay I m just 
(trying to bend the truth) 
I can t pretend I m who you want me to be, so I m

No no turning back now

No no turning back now 
(Let me take back my life,I d rather be all alone) 
No turning back now 
(Anywhere on my own cuz I can see) 
No no turning back now 
(The very worst part of you is me) 
 
I remember what they taught to me 
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be 
Remember listening to all of that and this again 
So I pretended up a person who was fittin in 
And now you think this person really is me and I m

But the more I push the more I'm pulling away 'cuz I'm

No no turning back now

MORNING AFTER

 Caught up against the war again 
Time to chill in the bar again 
Never seize to amaze in minds 
So I just sleep sleep sleep please don't 
Wake me till the morning after [2x] 
 
Cut my peace (?) by the flower again 
Lick my wounds like a dog again 
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel 
That I see I see please let it be but don't 
Wake me till the morning after [3x] 
 
Oh I'm so tired there has got to be an end 
to the pain I feel when I'm 
awake and alive alive alive 
alive and not dreamin'

NOBODY'S LISTENING

 Yo, peep the style and the kids checking for it 
The number one question is how could you ignore it 
And drop right back in the cut over basement tracks 
Rap stack got you backing this up like 
Rewind that we're just rolling with the rhythm 
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division 
With these non stop lyrics of life living 
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiving 
But in the meantime there are those who wanna talk this and that 
So I suppose that it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt 
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt 
 
it goes 
 
[Chorus] 
(Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me) 
Told you everything loud and clear 
(But nobody s listening) 
(Called to you so clearly but you don t want to hear me) 
Told you everything loud and clear 
(But nobody s listening) 
 
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress 
handfull of anger, held in my chest 
And everything left s a waste of time 
I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else s more 
I m riding on the back of this pressure 
Guessing that it s better I can t keep myself together 
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on 
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on 
Never forget the blood sweat and tears 
The uphill struggle over years the fear and 
Trash talking and the people it was to 
And the people that started it just like you 
 
[Chorus] 
(Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me) 
Told you everything loud and clear 
(But nobody s listening) 
(Called to you so clearly but you don t want to hear me) 
Told you everything loud and clear 
(But nobody s listening) 
 
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress 
handfull of anger, held in my chest 
Uphill struggle 
Blood sweat and tears 
Nothing to gain 
Everything to fear 
 
Heart full of pain, head full of stress 
handfull of anger, held in my chest 
Uphill struggle 
Blood sweat and tears 
Nothing to gain 
Everything to fear 
 
Heart full of pain 
 
[Chorus] 
(Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me) 
Told you everything loud and clear 
(But nobody s listening) 
(Called to you so clearly but you don t want to hear me)

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress

Uphill struggle 
Blood sweat and tears 
(Nobody s listening) 
Nothing to gain 
Everything to fear 
(Nobody s listening)

NUMB

 I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface 
Don't know what you're expecting of me 
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 
Every step I take is another mistake to you 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 
 
[Chorus] 
I've become so numb I can't feel you there 
I've become so tired so much more aware 
I've becoming this all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you 
 
Can't you see that you're smothering me 
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control 
Cause everything that you thought I would be 
Has fallen apart right in front of you 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 
And every second I waste is more than I can take 
 
[Chorus] 
I've become so numb I can't feel you there 
I've become so tired so much more aware 
I've becoming this all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you 
 
And I know 
I may end up failing too 
But I know 
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you 
 
[Chorus] 
I've become so numb I can't feel you there 
I've become so tired so much more aware 
I've becoming this all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you 
 
[Chorus] 
I've become so numb I can't feel you there 
Is everything what you want me to be 
I've become so numb I can't feel you there 
Is everything what you want me to be

ONE STEP CLOSER

 I cannot take this anymore 
I'm saying everything I've said before 
All these words they make no sense 
I find bliss in ignorance 
Less I hear the less you'll say 
But you'll find that out anyway 
Just like before... 
Everything you say to me 
Takes me one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break 
I need a little room to breathe 
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break 
I find the answers aren't so clear 
Wish I could find a way to disappear 
All these thoughts they make no sense 
I find bliss in ignorance 
Nothing seems to go away 
Over and over again 
shut up when I'm talking to you

 (feat. Mike Shinoda, Stephen Richards) 
 
When I look into your eyes there s nothing there to see 
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me 
 
Everything has to end 
You ll soon find that we re out of time left to watch it all unwind 
Everything falls apart 
Even the people who never froun eventually break down 
Everything has to end 
You ll soon find we re out of time left to watch in all unwind 
Everything falls apart 
Even the people who never frown eventually break down 
 
I ve lied to you 
This is the last smile that I ll fake for the sake of being with you 
Everything falls apart even 
Even the people who never frown eventually break down 
Everything has to end 
You ll soon find we re out of time left to watch it all unwind 
The sake of being with you 
Everything falls apart 
Even the people who never frown eventually break down 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
 
Why I stayed with you 
Just push away 
No matter what you see 
You re still so blind to me 
 
Even the people who never frown eventually break down 
 
I ve tried, like you, to do everything you wanted to 
This is the last time 
That I ll take the blame for the sake of being with you 
Everything falls apart 
Even the people who never frown eventually break down 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie 
Everything has to end 
You ll soon find we re out of time left to watch it all unwind 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
 
Why I stay with you 
Just push away 
No matter what you see 
You re still so blind to me 
 
Reverse psychology is failing miserably 
It s so hard to be left all alone 
Telling you is the only chance for me 
There is nothing left but to turn and face you 
When I look into your eyes there s nothing there to see 
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me 
Asking why 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
 
Why I stayed with you 
Just push away 
No matter what you see 
You re still so blind to me 
 
Why I stayed with you 
Just push away 
No matter what you see 
You re still so blind to me

 Why does it feel like night today? 
Something in here s not right today 
Why am I so uptight today? 
Paranoia s all I got left 
I don t know what stressed me first 
Or how the pressure was fed / but 
I know just what it feels like 
To have a voice in the back of my head 
It s like a face that I hold inside 
A face that awakes when I close my eyes 
A face watches every time I lie 
A face that laughs every time I fall 
(And watches everything) 
So I know that when it s time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is hearing me / right beneath my skin 
It s like I m / paranoid lookin over my back 
It s like a / whirlwind inside of my head 
It s like I / can t stop what I m hearing within 
It s like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
I know I ve got a face in me 
points out all the mistakes to me 
You ve got a face on the inside too and 
Your paranoia s probably worse 
I don t know what set me off first but I know what I can t stand 
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is 
I can t add up to what you can but 
Everybody has a face that they hold inside 
A face that awakes when they close their eyes 
A face watches every time they lie 
A face that laughs every time they fall 
(And watches everything) 
So you know that when it s time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is watching you too / right inside your skin 
The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me

PART OF ME

 Part of me won t go away 
Everyday reminded how much I hate it 
Weighted against the consequences 
Can t live without it so it s senseless 
Wanna cut it out of my soul 
And just live with a gaping hole 
Take control of my life 
And wash out all the burnt taste 
I made the problems in the first place 
Hang my head low cause it s part of me 
Ya hardly see right next to the heart of me 
Heard of me the routine scar 
New cuts cover where the old ones are 
And now I m sick of this 
I can t stand the sandpaper thoughts that grade away on my sanity 
I rather not even be then the man that s staring in the mirror through me 
 
Pre chorus 
Cut myself free willingly 
Sstop just what s killing me [4x] 
 
I feel it everyday 
I feel I made my way 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
Swallowing me 
 
It can t be frightening if you ve never felt it 
Once it s been dealt with you feel like you ve been touched by something angelic 
And then melted down into a pool of peace 
Cease to be the animal you used to be 
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong 
And feel the karma when the problem s all gone 
And then you start to see another piece of yourself that you can t let be 
And that reason ll last fight to free yourself 
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well 
And now you know you can choose to lose the part in your heart 
Where your insides bruise 
You can live if you re willing to 
Put a stop to just what s killing you 
 
[Pre chorus (4x)] 
 
[Chorus] 
 
(Alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently 
This part of me won t go away, part of me won t go away 
Everywhere I look around I see how everyone aught to be 
Every time I see myself I see there s always something wrong with me) 
 
[Chorus (2x)] 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me [2x]

I want to be in another place 
I hate when you say you don t understand 
I want to be in the energy 
Not with the enemy 
A place for my head 
 
I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night 
Shining with the light from the sun 
But the sun doesn t give the light to the moon assuming the moon s going to owe it one 
It makes me think of how you act to me 
You do favours then rapidly 
You just turn around and start asking me about things that you want back from me 
 
I m so sick of the tension 
Sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest 
I m so sick of the tension 
Sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest

Yo, yo, yo 
Give me Energon to keep me calm 
You and your mom keep all the dram 
Used to be a team, passed that baton 
But you flop that bomb as you drop that bomb 
Take it to the john in your babylon 
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on 
I don t really give a dang 
You p****d on my lawn 
Took a dump like a punk 
Now the battle s on 
 
So sick of you stressing 
Sick of you fessing 
Sick of you acting like I owe you some 
Find another place 
To feed your face 
If you don t, we gon bump 
Get it up here, crunk

The same way that I always do 
This is the last smile 
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

Even the people who never frown 
Eventually break down) 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie 
(Everything has to end 
You'll soon find we're out of time left 
To watch it all unwind) 
The sacrifice is never knowing 
 
Why I never walked away 
Why I played myself this way 
Now I see your testing me pushes me away 
Why I never walked away 
Why I played myself this way 
Now I see your testing me pushes me away 
 
I've tried like you 
To do everything you wanted too 
This is the last time 
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

 (When this began) 
I had nothing to say 
And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me 
(I was confused) 
And I let it all out to find/ 
That I m not the only person with these things in mind 
(Inside of me) 
But all the vacancy the words revealed 
Is the only real thing that I ve got left to feel 
(Nothing to lose) 
Just stuck/ hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own 
 
[Chorus] 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real 
I wanna let go of the pain I ve felt so long 
(Erase all the pain till it s gone) 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I m close to something real 
I wanna find something I ve wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 
 
And I ve got nothing to say 
I can t believe I didn t fall right down on my face 
(I was confused) 
Looking everywhere only to find 
That it s not the way I had imagined it all in my mind 
(So what am I) 
What do I have but negativity 
 Cause I can t justify the way, everyone is looking at me 
(Nothing to lose) 
Nothing to gain/ hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own 
 
[Repeat Chorus] 
 
I will never know myself until I do this on my own 
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed 
I will never be anything till I break away from me 
I will break away, I'll find myself today 
 
[Repeat Chorus] 
 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I m somewhere I belong 
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I m somewhere I belong 
Somewhere I belong

STEP UP

 Watch as the room rocks 
Mentally moonwalk 
Mixed media slang 
Banging in your boom box verbal violence 
Lyrical stylist 
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish 
You can t tempt me with rhymes that are empty 
Rapping to a beat doesn t make you an emcee 
With your lack of skill and facility 
You re killing me 
And a DJ in the group just for credibility 
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes 
You re not an emcee if someone else writes your lines 
And rapping over rock doesn t make you a pioneer 
Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years 
But now they re getting randomly mixed and matched up 
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck 
So how does it stack up? None of it s real 
You want to be an emcee you ve got to study the skill 
 
Who can rock a rhyme like this? 
Bring it to you every time like this? [2x] 
Step, step up, step, step up 
 
So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity 
But mentally you don t have the hip hop energy 
With a tendency to make up stories 
Sounding like the only hip hop you ve heard is top 40 
And your record company is completely missing it 
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate 
So in a battle you can't hack it 
React with whack shit 
And get smacked with verbal back flips 
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts 
It's taken decades for emcees to establish this 
You re new to hip hop and welcome if your serious 
But not on the mic 
Leave that to the experienced 
 
(Using the waves of sound the true master paralyzes his opponents, leaving him 
vulnerable to attack) 
 
[Chorus (2x)] 
 
(After years of pain staking research by the world's leading sound scientists, we

SUPER XERO (BY MYSELF)

 What do I do to ignore what's behind me? 
Do I follow my fate and escape blindly? 
Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams 
And give into sad thoughts that are maddening? 
Do I let it go and try to stand it? 
Or do I try to catch them redhanded? 
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness? 
Or do I trust none and live life in lonliness? 
 
The sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men 
I make the right turns but I'm lost within 
I put on my daily fa ade but then 
I just end up gettin' hurt again 
 
[pre chorus:] 
By myself (Myself) 
I ask why (but in my mind I find) 
I can't rely on myself (Myself) 
I ask why (but in my mind I find) 
I can't rely on myself 
 
[chorus]: 
I can't hold on 
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
To anything watchin' everything spin 
With thoughts of failure sinking in 
 
If I turn my back I'm defenseless 
And to give in to fate seems senseless 
If I hide my pride and let it all go on 
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone 
If I let them go I'll be outdone 
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun 
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer 
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer... 
 
[pre chorus and chorus] 
 
How do you think 
That I've lost so much 
I'm always afraid 
That I'm out of touch 
How do you expect 
That I will know what to do 
When all I know 
Is what you tell me to 
 
Don't you (know) 
I can't tell you how to make it (go) 
No matter what I do, how hard I (try) 
I can't seem to convince myself (why) 
I'm stuck on the outside 
[x2] 
 
[chorus] 
 
I can't hold on 
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin 
It's all too much to take in 
I can't hold on 
To anything watchin' everything spin 
With thoughts of failure from with...(in)

You fell away 
What more can I say? 
The feeling's evolve 
I won't let it out 
I can't replace 
Your screaming face 
Feeling the sickness inside 
Why won't you die? 
Your blood in mine 
We'll be fine 
Then your body will be mine 
 
So many words 
Can't describe my face 
This feeling's evolved 
So soon to break out 
I can't relate 
To a happy state 
Feeling the blood run inside 
 
Why won't you die? 
Your blood and mine 
We'll be fine 
Then your body will be mine 
 
Why is everything so fucking hard for me? 
Keep me down to what you think I should be 
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry? 
Keep on trying I won't die so easily 
 
(I will not die!) 
 
Why is everything so fucking hard for me?

 I woke up in a dream today 
To the cold of the static / and put my cold feet on the floor 
Forgot all about yesterday 
Remembering I m pretending to be where I m not anymore 
A little taste of hypocrisy 
And I m left in the wake of the mistake / slow to react 
Even though you re so close to me 
You re still so distant / And I can t bring you back 
It s true / the way I feel 
Was promised by your face 
The sound of your voice 
Painted on my memories 
Even if you re not with me 
I m with you 
You / Now I see/ keeping everything inside 
You / Now I see / Even when I close my eyes 
I hit you and you hit me back 
We fall to the floor / the rest of the day stands still 
Fine line between this and that 
When things go wrong I pretend the past isn t real 
Now I'm trapped in this memory 
And I m left in the wake of the mistake / slow to react 
Even though you re close to me 
You re still so distant / And I can t bring you back 
no 
No matter how far we've come 
I can't wait to see tomorrow 
With you

With You 
You, now I see 
Even when I close my eyes 
 
I hit you and you hit me back 
We fall to the floor 
The rest of the day stands still 
Fine line between this and that 
But when things go wrong 
I pretend that the past isn t real 
I m trapped in this memory 
And I m left in the wake of the mistake 
Slow to react 
Even though you re so close to me 
You re still so distant 
And I can t bring you back 
 
It s true 
The way I feel 
Was promised by your face 
The sound of your voice 
Painted on my memories 
Even if you re not with me 
 
I m with you 
You, now I see 
Keeping everything inside 
With You 
You, now I see 
Even when I close my eyes 
With you 
You, now I see 
Keeping everything inside 
With You 
You, now I see 
Even when I close my eyes 
 
No, I won t let you control my fate 
While I m holding the wait of the world on my conscience 
No, I won t just sit here and wait 
While you wear your options 
You re making a fool of me 
No, you didn t dare try to say that you don t care 
And solemnly swear not to follow me there 
No, it ain t like me to beg on my knees 
Oh, please, oh, baby, please 
That s not how I m doing things 
No, I m not upset 
No, I m not angry 
I know love is love, love 
Sometimes it pains me 
With or without you 
I ll always be with you 
You ll never forget me 
I m keeping you with me 
No, I won t let you take me to the end of my rope 
While you burn and torture my soul 
No, I m not your puppet 
And, no, no, no, I won t let you go 
 
No, no matter how far we ve come 
I can t wait to see tomorrow 
No matter how far we ve come, I 
I can t wait to see tomorrow 
 
With you 
You, now I see 
Keeping everything inside 
With You 
You, now I see 
Even when I close my eyes 
With you 
You, now I see 
Keeping everything inside 
With You 
You, now I see 
Even when I close my eyes

 

LINKIN PARK
X ECUTIONER STYLE

 (feat. Black Thought) 
 
From the top 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up when I m talking to you 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
I m about to br 
Wasn t that fun? 
Let s try something else 
 
Forty five calibre killer from out of the filler 
Definitely going to show y all brothers how you not a gorilla 
Smooth talking, fully automatic weapon concealer 
Taste thriller, break thriller 
Let s hit em with the bounce filler 
Filthy stinking, standing on solid ground 
And still be sinking, submerging in the parks 
Still be linking, plucked beef when it starts 
To f**k your thinking, it s not a mirage 
I m in the motherf**king track, yo, from out the garage 
With an if, you to duck, but it s hard to dodge 
In the back of the spine where my dawgs, they lie 
Going to flip it straight up, ripping apart your squad 
X ecutioner style, cuts and blends like a syringe 
Hanging you from each of your limbs 
See me coming through the party hard without no bodyguard 
Smoking something, stomping on each of you Tims 
I m the B to the L, the A, the C, King 
And when it comes to planning 
The thought to keep thinking, man 
 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up 
Shut up
