(LOVE IS) THE TENDER TRAP

 You see a pair of laughing eyes 
And suddenly your sighing sighs 
You're thinking nothing's wrong 
You string along, boy, then snap! 
 
Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap 
 
You're hand in hand beneath the trees 
And soon there's music in the breeze 
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap! 
 
Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap 
 
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle 
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single 
 
And all at once it seems so nice 
The folks are throwing shoes and rice 
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map 
 
You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap 
 
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle 
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single 
 
And all at once it seems so nice 
The folks are throwing shoes and rice 
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map 
 
And then you wonder how it all came about 
It's too late now there's no gettin' out 
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap

A BABY JUST LIKE YOU

 The season is upon us now 
A time for gifts and giving 
And as the year draws to its close 
I think about my living 
The Christmas time when I was young, 
The magic and the wonder, 
But colors dull and candles dim, 
And dark my standing under 
O little Zachary, shining light 
You've set my soul to dreaming 
You've given back my joy in life 
And filled me with new meaning 
 
A Savior King was born that day, 
A baby just like you, 
And as the Magi came with gifts, 
I come with my gift too 
That peace on Earth fills up your time, 
That brotherhood surrounds you. 
 
That you may know the warmth of love, 
And wrap it all around you 
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told 
From days when I was young 
 
Merry Christmas, little Zachary 
Merry Christmas, everyone 
Merry Christmas, little Zachary 
Merry Christmas, everyone

 

FRANK SINATRA
A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A FOOL

 A day in the life of a fool, a sad and a long lonely day 
I walk the avenue, and hope I'll run into 
The welcome sight of you, coming my way 
I stop just across from your door, but you're never home any more 
So back to my room, and there in the gloom 
I cry tears of good bye 
That's the way it will be every day in the life of fool

 

FRANK SINATRA
A FINE ROMANCE

 A fine romance, with no kisses 
A fine romance, my friend this is 
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes 
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes 
A fine romance, you won't nestle 
A fine romance, you won't wrestle 
I might as well play bridge 
With my old maid aunt 
I haven't got a chance 
This is a fine romance 
 
A fine romance, my good fellow 
You take romance, I'll take jello 
You're calmer than the seals 
In the arctic ocean 
At least they flap their fins 
To express emotion 
A fine romance with no quarrels 
With no insults and all morals 
I've never mussed the crease 
In your blue serge pants 
I never get the chance 
This is a fine romance

A FOGGY DAY

 A foggy day, in London town, it had me low, and it had me down 
I viewed the morning, with much alarm, the British Museum, had lost its charm 
How long I wondered, could this thing last, but the age of miracles, it hadn't past 
And suddenly, I saw you standing right there 
And in foggy London town, the sun was shining everywhere

 

FRANK SINATRA
A GARDEN IN THE RAIN

 'twas just a garden in the rain 
Close to a little leafy lane 
A touch of color 'neath skies of gray 
 
The raindrops kissed the flower beds 
The blossoms raised their thirsty heads 
A perfumed Thank you they seemed to say 
 
Surely here was charm beyond compare to view 
Maybe it was just that I was there with you 
 
'twas just a garden in the rain 
But then the sun came out again 
And sent us happily on our way 
 
[instrumental] 
 
'twas just a garden in the rain

A HUNDRED YEARS FROM TODAY

 Hey don't save your kisses just pass 'em around 
You'll find my reason is logically sound 
Who's gonna know that you past them around 
A hundred years from today 
And why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen 
You're nearer heaven on mamma Earth's green 
If you had millions what would they all me 
One hundred years from today 
So (Hey) laugh and sing make love the thing 
Be happy while you may 
('Cause) There's always one beneath the sun 
Who's bound to make you feel that way 
The moon is shining and that's a (very) good sign 
Cling to me closer say (that) you'll be mine 
Remember baby we won't see it shine 
A hundred years from today, a hundred years from today

 

FRANK SINATRA
A LONG NIGHT

 Long night, it's a long night, my friend 
The barrooms and the back street's dead end 
Sometimes I thought I saw the sunrise and good times in the air 
It was just, it was just another big town with midnight's neon glare 
 
Long night, it's a long night, I know 
The bus rides and the nowhere to go 
 
I've seen what the street corners do to things like love and dreams 
Seen what the bottle can do to a man with his hopes and his schemes 
 
A long night, what a long night it has been 
The wheelers and the dealers, they win 
I've tasted the 90 proof gin and chased it away with the blues 
I rarely paid debts that I owed but I sure have paid my dues 
 
No daylight, just a long night for me

 

FRANK SINATRA
A MAN ALONE

 In me, you see a man alone 
Held by the habit of being on his own 
A man who listens to the trembling of the trees 
With sentimental ease 
 
In me, you see a man alone 
Behind the wall he's learned to call his home 
A man who still goes walkin' in the rain 
Expecting love again 
 
A man not lonely except when the dark comes on 
A man learning to live with mem'ries of midnights that fell apart at dawn 
 
In me, you see a man alone 
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone 
A man who knows love is seldom what it seems 
Only other people's dreams 
 
[instrumental strings] 
 
A man learning to live with memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn 
 
In me, you see a man alone 
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone 
A man who knows love is seldom what it seems 
Just other people's dreams

A NIGHTINGALE SANG IN BERKELEY SQUARE

 That certain night, the night we met 
There was magic abroad in the air 
There were angels dining at the Ritz 
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square 
 
I may be right, I may be wrong 
But I'm perfectly willing to swear 
That when you turned and smiled at me 
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square 
 
The moon that lingered over London town 
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown 
How could he know we two were so in love? 
The whole darn world seemed upside down 
 
The streets of town were paved with stars 
It was such a romantic affair 
And, as we kissed and said goodnight, 
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square 
 
[instrumental]

AFTER YOU'VE GONE

 After you've gone and left me crying, after you've gone there's no denying 
You'll feel blue you're gonna be sad 
You've missed the dearest pal that (slickest partner) you ever had 
There'll come a time don't you forget it 
(Yeah) There'll come a time when you're gonna regret it 
Some day when you get lonely 
Your heart will break like mine (and) you'll want me only. 
After you've gone (split) after you've gone away (flown the coop) 
After we paid our dues together 
You should have stayed through all that nasty weather 
Someday while you're feeling badly 
You'll need the only one that loves you so madly 
But I'll be gone yes I'll be gone to stay 
Yeah after I've gone after I've gone away

 

FRANK SINATRA
AIN'T SHE SWEET

 Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street. 
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet? 
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice. 
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice? 
Just cast an eye in her direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection? 
Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat? 
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet? 
[Instrumental break] 
[Repeat all] 
[Repeat 1 with last two lines twice.]

 

FRANK SINATRA
ALL ALONE

 All alone, I'm so all alone 
There is no one else but you 
All alone by the telephone 
Waiting for a ring, a ting a ling 
 
I'm all alone every evening 
All alone, feeling blue 
Wond'ring where you are and how you are 
And if you are all alone too 
 
[instrumental] 
 
I wonder where you are (remember me) and how you are (remember me) 
And if you are (I love you) all alone (I love you) too

ALL I NEED IS THE GIRL

 [lengthy instrumental intro] 
 
Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest, all I need now is the girl 
Got my striped tie, got my hopes high 
Got the time and the place and I got the rhythm, 
Now all I need's the girl to go with'em 
 
If she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl 
And if she'll say My, darling, I'm yours 
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best pressed tweed 
All I really need is the girl 
 
[lengthy instrumental while Franks hums and scats off and on] 
 
Got my tweed pressed, I got my best vest, all I need now is the girl 
Got my striped tie, got my hopes way up high 
I got the time and the place and the rhythm 
All I need's the girl to go with'em 
 
Mm, if she'll just appear we'll take this, this great big town for a whirl 
And if, if she'll say My, darlin', I'm yours 
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best pressed tweed 
All I real, really need is the girl

ALL MY TOMORROWS

 Today I may not have a thing at all except for just a dream or two 
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow and all my tomorrows belong to you 
Right now it may not seem like spring at all, we're drifting and the laughs are few 
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow, and all my tomorrows belong to you 
No one knows better than I that luck keeps passing me by ... that's fate 
But with you there at my side, I'll soon be turning the tide ... just wait 
As long as I've got arms that cling at all, it's you that I'll be clinging to 
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow on some bright tomorrow they'll all come true 
And all my bright tomorrows belong to you

 

FRANK SINATRA
ALL OF YOU

 I love the look(s) of you, (and) the lure of you, the sweet of you, and the pure of you 
The eyes, the arms, and the (that) mouth of you, 
The east, west, north, and the (that) south of you 
I'd love to gain complete control of you, handle even the heart and soul of you 
Love at least a small percent of me do cause (Because) I love all of you.

 

FRANK SINATRA
ALL OR NOTHING AT ALL

 All or nothin' at all 
Half a love never appealed to me 
If your heart, it never could yield to me 
Then I'd rather, rather have nothin' at all 
 
I said all, nothin' at all 
If it's love, there ain't no in between 
Why begin then cry for somethin' that might have been 
No I'd rather, rather have nothin' at all 
 
Hey, please don't bring your lips close to my cheek 
Don't you smile or I'll be lost beyond recall 
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak 
And my heart, it may grow very dizzy and fall 
 
And if I fell under the spell of your call 
I would be, be caught in the undertow 
Well, you see, I've got to say No, no, no 
All or nothin' at all 
 
[instrumental] 
 
And if I fell, fell under the spell of your call 
Don't you know I would be caught in the undertow?

ALL THE WAY

 When somebody loves you 
It's no good unless he loves you all the way 
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you all the way 
 
[Chorus:] 
Taller than the tallest tree is 
That's how it's got to feel 
Deeper than the deep blue sea is 
That's how deep it goes if it's real 
 
When somebody needs you 
It's no good unless he needs you all the way 
Through the good or lean years 
And for all the in between years come what may 
 
[Bridge:] 
Who knows where the road will lead us 
Only a fool would say 
But if you'll let me love you 
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way 
 
 
[instrumental last two lines of Chorus] 
 
So, if you'll let me love you 
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way

 

FRANK SINATRA
ALL THE WAY HOME

 Bluebirds, flowers 
Sunshine and showers 
Sunsets and rainbows 
On skies of red and blue 
Badges, whistles 
Rockets and missiles 
Puppies, kittens 
And penny candy too 
You make me feel so new 
Like carnivals and carousels 
Popsicles and wishing wells 
And I am so in love with you 
I can't believe it's true 
We're gonna make it all the way home 
 
Magic potions, 
Incense and lotions 
Bells, books and candles 
Can make a witches' brew 
But I don't need witches 
Love spells or riches 
You are my treasure 
My fairy tale come true 
With you is where I'll stay 
All the time, anywhere 
Turn around, and I'll be there 
It was I, now it's we 
And I know it will be 
You and me, all the way home 
Me and you, all the way home.

AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL

 (America, America, America, America) 
 
O beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain 
For purple moutain majesties above thy fruited plain! 
America, America, God shed His grace on thee 
And crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea 
 
(O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years) 
(Thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears) 
America, America, God shed His grace on thee 
And crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea

AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS

 Give me an old fashioned Christmas, an old fashioned Christmas, 
Family faces, wide open spaces, covered with snow, 
Right now my mom there in the kitchen, basting the Christmas bird, 
You'll have to take my word, you can't find that at the automat. 
An old fashioned fireplace, give me an old fashioned fireplace, 
My heart remembers smoldering embers, warming your glow, 
I'd trade that whole Manhattan skyline, the shimmering steel and chrome, 
For one old fashioned Christmas back home.

 

FRANK SINATRA
ANY TIME AT ALL

 Anytime, anytime you want me, honey, just let me know. 
When you need affection, and you're looking for somewhere to go, 
I'll be home, 'round the house just waiting, waiting for your call. 
I mean anytime you want me, anytime at all. 
Don't be ashamed to let me know you love me, that's such a silly thing to do, 
'Cause anytime, you call me, baby, I'll come running straight to you. 
I'll be there beside you even if I have to crawl, 
Anytime you want me, I'm saying, anytime at all. 
(I'll be there beside you even if I have to crawl,) 
Anytime you want me, I mean, anytime at all.

 

FRANK SINATRA
ANYTIME (I'LL BE THERE)

 Anytime you need me babe, just call I'll be there 
Call and see what a good friend can be 
When you need someone to care 
Nothing more than understanding, just a man who's undemanding 
Like a leaf that's only landing suddenly goes when the wind gently blows 
And I'm asking nothing of you love, only what you want to give 
And I wish you what I wish myself, ss long as I may live 
Other arms will surely hold you, just remember the things that I told you 
When these arms of mine enfold you 
It's not out of greed but for love, and for need. 
 
I love you so, I still do, I'm sure you know when I'm holding you 
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye 
Call and I'll come when your world's come undone 
I'm like you, I get lonely too, and I need someone to hold 
Knowing well this world can be hell and sometimes very cold 
 
Nothing firm and nothing binding, now and then a slight reminding 
Waking up one day and finding somewhere to run, somewhere to run 
Somewhere to run when your world's come undone 
Oh babe, I'll be there, I'll be there anytime 
 
There's a certain thing about you, summer, fall and spring about you 
I could write and sing about you, and never run out, never run out (no) 
Never run out of what you're all about 
Oh babe, I'll be there , I'll be there anytime

 

FRANK SINATRA
AS YOU DESIRE ME

 As you desire me, so shall I come to you, 
Howe'er you wander, so shall I be, 
Be it forever, or be it just a day, 
As you desire me, come what may. 
I doubt not but you will do what you will with me, 
I give my life to you 'cause you're my destiny. 
And now, come take me, my soul is yours. 
As you desire me, I come to you. 
And now, come take me, my very soul is yours, 
As you desire me, I come to you.

AT LONG LAST LOVE

 Is it an earthquake or simply a shock? 
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock? 
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy? 
Or is what I feel the real McCoy? 
 
Is it for all time or simply a lark? 
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park? 
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of? 
Or is it at long last love?

 Anytime you call, I'm so available, anytime you call,

(Anytime, anytime) Don't have to bring a cake or a band home, 
You don't have to phone ahead. 
Make no mistake, I'm still the old standby, 
I am as you might guess, at the old address, 
Chances are that you are unassailable and that we are through. 
(Chances are, chances are) 
But what can I do, I'm still available, just like the first evening star, 
You can trust that I'll be there, summer, spring or fall, 
I'm in love and available, anytime at all. 
(But what could I do, I'm still available, like the first evening star)

BANG BANG (MY BABY SHOT ME DOWN)

 I was five and she was six 
We rode on horses made of sticks 
I wore black and she wore white 
She would always win the fight 
 
Bang bang, she shot me down 
Bang bang, I hit the ground 
Bang bang, that awful sound 
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time 
And we grew up, I called her mine 
She would always laugh and say 
 Remember when we used to play? 
 
 Bang bang, I shot you down 
 Bang bang, you hit the ground 
 Bang bang, that awful sound 
 Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

Just for me the church bells rang

Bang bang, that awful sound 
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

 Where there is sunrise, there is Barbara, only Barbara clothes that way, 
Where there is laughter, there is Barbara, always Barbara warm and gay. 
And when there's music, she is the song, the song I'm singing my whole life long. 
There's no one just like her, like Barbara, only Barbara is so rare. 
Wherever she is, I'll be there. 
There's no one just like her, like Barbara, only Barbara, she's so rare, 
Wherever she is, I'll be there.

BAUBLES, BANGLES AND BEADS

 Baubles, bangles, hear how they jing, jinga linga 
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads 
Sparkles, spangles, your heart will sing, singa linga 
Wearin' baubles, bangles and beads 
 
You'll glitter and gleam so 
Make somebody dream so that 
 
Some day he may buy you a ring, ringa linga 
I've heard that's where it leads 
Wearin' baubles, bangles, and beads

BE CAREFUL, IT'S MY HEART

 Be careful, it's my heart, it's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart. 
It's not the note that I sent you that you quickly burn, 
It's not a book I lent you that you never return. 
Remember, it's my heart,. the heart with which so willingly I part 
It's yours to take, to keep or break, but please, before you start, 
Be careful, it's my heart.

BEIN' GREEN

 It's not that easy bein' green 
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves 
When I think it could be nicer bein' red or yellow or gold 
Or something much more colorful like that 
 
It's not easy bein' green 
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things 
And people tend to pass you over 'cause you're 
Not standin' out like flashy sparkles on the water 
Or stars in the sky 
 
But green is the color of Spring 
And green can be cool and friendly like 
And green can be big like an ocean 
Or important like a mountain 
Or tall like a tree 
 
When green is all there is to be 
It could make you wonder why 
But why wonder, why wonder? 
I am green and it'll do fine 
It's beautiful 
And I think it's what I want to be

BEWITCHED

 [Intro:] 
She's a fool and don't I know it? 
But a fool can have her charms 
I'm in love and don't I show it? 
Like a babe in arms 
 
Love's the same old sad sensation 
Lately, I've not slept a wink 
Since this silly situation 
Has me on the blink 
 
I'm wild again, beguiled again 
A simpering, whimpering child again 
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I 
 
Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep 
Then love came and told me I shouldn't sleep 
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I 
 
Lost my heart, but what of it? 
She is cold, I agree 
She might laugh, but I love it 
Although the laugh's on me 
 
I'll sing to her, bring spring to her 
And long for the day when I'll cling to her 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

 

FRANK SINATRA
BLUE LACE

 Blue lace, her gown was blue lace, 
She wore the promise of springtime and laughter. 
Daybreak, we talked till daybreak 
Without a warning of what might come after. 
Her touch was velvet, I still can feel it 
That one brief moment that ended in space. 
Sometime in mid December, 
I hear the music, the echo of springtime laughter, 
All day I see the old days, 
When I'd seen the young girls in blue, blue lace. 
Her gown was blue lace, such lovely blue lace, 
Her gown was blue.

BONITA

 What can I say to you, Bonita, what magic word would capture you 
Like a soft salacious mist you are, Bonita, you fly away when love is new 
What do you ask of me, Bonita, what part do you want me to play, 
Shall I be the clown for you, Bonita, I will be anything you say. 
Bonita, don't run away, Bonita. 
Bonita, don't be afraid to fall in love with me, 
I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you, Bonita. 
If you love me, life would be beautiful, Bonita. 
I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you. 
If you love me, life would be beautiful, Bonita.

BORN FREE

 Born free, as free as the wind blows, as free as the grass grows, 
Born free to follow your heart. 
Live free and beauty surrounds you, the world still astounds you, 
Each time you look at the stars. 
Stay free where no walls divide you, you're free as the roaring tide, 
So there's no need to hide. 
Born free and life is worth living, but only worth livng, 
Cause you're born free.

BOTH SIDES, NOW

 Rows and flows of angel hair 
And ice cream castles in the air 
And feather canyons ev'rywhere 
I've looked at clouds that way 
 
But now they only block the sun 
They rain and snow on ev'ryone 
So many things I would have done 
But clouds got in my way 
I've looked at clouds from both sides now 
 
From up and down, and still somehow 
It's cloud illusions I recall 
I really don't know clouds at all 
 
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels 
The dizzy dancing way you feel 
As ev'ry fairy tale comes real 
I've looked at love that way 
 
But now it's just another show 
You leave 'em laughing when you go 
And if you care, don't let them know 
Don't give yourself away 
 
I've looked at love from both sides now 
From give and take, and still somehow 
It's love's illusions I recall 
I really don't know love at all 
 
Tears and fears and feeling proud 
To say I love you right out loud 
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds 
I've looked at life that way 
 
But now old friends are acting strange 
They shake their heads, they say I've changed 
Well something's lost, but something's gained 
In living ev'ry day 
 
I've looked at life from both sides now 
From win and lose and still somehow 
It's life's illusions I recall 
I really don't know life at all 
I've looked at life from both sides now 
From up and dawn, and still somehow 
It's life's illusions I recall 
I really don't know life at all

 

FRANK SINATRA
BUT NOT FOR ME

 They're writing songs of love but not for me, a lucky star's above but not for me 
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds of gray 
Than any Russian play can guarantee 
I was a fool to fall and get this way; 
Hi ho alas and also lackaday 
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss 
I guess she's not she's not for me 
Old man sunshine listen you never tell me dreams come true 
Just try it and all start a riot 
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare ever tell me she will care 
I'm certain it's the final curtain 
I never want to here from any cheerful Polly Anna's 
Who tell you fate supplies a mate it's all bananas 
It all began so well but what an end, this is the time a fellow needs a friend 
When every happy plot, ends with a marriage knot 
And there's no knot, no (k)not for me

BY THE TIME I GET TO PHOENIX

 By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising. 
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door. 
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving 
 Cause I've left that girl so many times before. 
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working. 
She'll probably stop for lunch and give me a call. 
But she'll just hear the phone keep on ringing, on the wall, that's all. 
By the time I reach Oklahoma she'll be sleeping. 
She'll turn softly and call my name out low. 
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her, 
Though time and time again I tried to tell her so. 
She just didn't know I would really go.

CALIFORNIA

 I've known her valleys, I've known her mountains 
Her missions and her courtyards and her fountains 
The giant redwoods towering in the skies of her 
That grow as though as they know they show the size of her 
 
I've often wandered her farthest reaches 
Her deserts and her snow and, yes, her beaches 
A land that paradise could well be jealous of 
That's California, California, blessed by heaven from above 
That's California, land I love 
 
(I've known her valleys, I've known her mountains) 
(Her missions and her courtyards and her fountains) 
(The giant redwoods towering in the skies of her) 
(That grow as though as they know they show the size of her) 
 
I've often wandered her farthest reaches 
Her deserts and her snows and, yes, her beaches 
A land that paradise could well be jealous of 
That's California, California, bless'd by heaven from above 
That's California, the land I love

CALL ME

 When you're feeling sad and lonely there's a service I can render. 
Tell the one who loves you only, I can be so warm and tender. 
Call me, don't be afraid you can call me, maybe it's late but just call me. 
Call me and I'll be around. 
When its seems your friends desert you, there's somebody thinking of you. 
I'm the one who'll never hurt you, maybe it's because I love you. 
Call me, don't be afraid you can call me, maybe it's late but just call me. 
Call me and I'll be around. 
Now don't forget me, cause if you let me, I will always stay by you. 
You got to trust me, that's how it must be, there's so much I can do. 
If you call, I'll be right with you. You and I should be together. 
Take this love I long to give you. I'll die at your side forever, call me, call me.

 

FRANK SINATRA
CALL ME IRRESPONSIBLE

 Call me irresponsible call me unreliable, throw in undependable too 
Do my foolish alibis bore you, well I'm not too clever I just adore you 
Call me unpredictable tell me I'm impractical, rainbows I'm inclined to pursue 
Call me irresponsible yes I'm unreliable, 
But it's undeniably true I'm irresponsibly mad for you

 

FRANK SINATRA
CHANGE PARTNERS

 Must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man? 
You have danced with him since the music began. 
Won't you change partners and dance with me? 
Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face? 
Can't you see 
I'm longing to be in his place? 
Won't you change partners and dance with me? 
Ask him to sit this one out. while you're alone, 
I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone. 
You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven knows when. 
Won't you change partners and then, 
You may never want to change partners again.

CHARMAINE

 [Male Verse] 
I can't forget the night we met how bright were stars above 
That precious memory lingers yet when you declared your love 
and then you went away and now each night and day 
 
I wonder why you keep me waiting, Charmaine, my Charmaine 
I wonder when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again 
I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams be the same 
I wonder if you ever think of me too .. 
I am waiting my Charmaine for you ... 
 
[Female Verse] 
You went away on dreary day I knew you had to go, 
Mid tears and cheers I heard you say Charmaine, I love you so 
Tho old years turn to new my heart keeps calling you 
 
 I wonder why you keep me waiting Charmaine cries in vain 
 I wonder when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again 
I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams by the same 
I wonder if you ever think of me too 
Charmaine's waiting, just for you.

CHRISTMAS MEMORIES

 Singing carols, stringing popcorn, making footprints in the snow, 
Memories, Christmas memories, they're the sweetest ones I know. 
Cookies taking in the kitchen, calls in rhythm everywhere, 
Proxies, Christmas memories, float like snowflakes in the air. 
Oh the joy of waking Christmas mornings, the family round the tree, 
We had a way of making Christmas morning as merry as can be, 
I close my eyes and see shining faces 
Of all the children who now have children of their own 
Funny, but comes December, and I remember every Christmas I've known.

 

FRANK SINATRA
CLOSE TO YOU

 Close to you, I will always stay. 
Close to you, though you're far away. 
 
You'll always be near as though you were here by my side. 
No matter where in my dreams I'll find you there 
Close to me, sharing you're caress. 
Can't you see you're my happiness? 
 
Wherever you go, my heart will go, too. 
What can I do? 
It only wants to be close to you. 
 
[Musical interlude] 
 
Wherever you go, my heart will go, too. 
What can I do? 
It only wants to be close to you.

COME BACK TO ME

 Hear my voice, where you are, take a train, steal a car, 
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me. 
Catch a flame, catch a breeze, on your hand, on your knees, 
Swim up high, only please come on back to me. 
On a mule, in a jet, with your hair in a net, 
In a shower wet, I don't care. 
This is where you should be, from the hills to the shore, 
By the wind to my door, raise the highway dust, 
Break the law if you must, throw the world, only just 
Come back to me. 
 
Blast your hide, you recall, must I fight City hall 
Here and now, damn it all, come on back to me, 
Where on earth must I be, still I yell till I'm blue, 
In control then when you come on back to me. 
Have you gone to the moon, or the corner saloon 
And to crack and to croon, oh my girl, where in hell can you be? 
In a crate, in a trunk, on a horse, on a junk, 
In a road or a van, wrapped in mink or saran, 
Anyway that you can, came back to me, 
Come back to me, come back to me, come back, 
Come back to me, me!

COME BLOW YOUR HORN

 Make like a Mister Milquetoast and you'll get shut out, 
Make like a Mister Meek and you'll get cut out, 
Make like a little lamb, and wham, you're shorn, 
I tell ya, chum, it's time to come blow your horn. 
 
Make like a Mister Mumbles and you're a zero, 
Make like a Mister Big; they dig a hero. 
You've got to sound your A the day you're born, 
I tell ya, chum, it's time to come blow your horn. 
 
The taller the tree is the sweeter the peach, 
I'll give you the whole maguilla in a one word speach: Reach! 
 
Make like the world's your pudding, but light the brandy, 
Even the mildest kiss is a dan, dan, dandy, 
There'll be no love in bloom come doomsday morn, 
I tell ya, chum, it's time to come blow your horn. 
 
[Musical Interlude] 
 
In civilized jungles females adore 
The lions who come on swingin'; if you wanna score roar! 
 
You can be either read to or be the reader, 
You can be either lead or be the leader. 
Don't wait until you're told you're old and worn, 
Take in some air and get your lips puckered, 
Before you find you're simply too tuckered, 
I'll tell ya, chum, it's time to come blow your horn. 
 
Blow your horn, 
I tell ya, chum, it's time to come blow your horn.

COME FLY WITH ME

 Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away 
If you can use some exotic booze 
There's a bar in far Bombay 
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away 
 
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru 
In llama land there's a one man band 
And he'll toot his flute for you 
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue 
 
Once I get you up there where the air is rarified 
We'll just glide, starry eyed 
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near 
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together 
 
Weather wise it's such a lovely day 
You just say the words and we'll beat the birds 
Down to Ac apulco Bay 
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say 
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

COME RAIN OR COME SHINE

 I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you 
Come rain or come shine 
High as a mountain and deep as a river 
Come rain or come shine 
 
[Bridge] 
I guess when you met me, it was just one of those things 
But don't you ever bet me, 'cause I'm gonna be true if you let me 
 
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me 
Come rain or come shine 
We'll be happy together, unhappy together 
Now won't that be just fine? 
 
The days may be cloudy or sunny 
We're in or we're out of the money 
But I'm with you always 
I'm with you rain or shine

COME WALTZ WITH ME

 27, 1962, Los Angeles] 
 
Before we say good bye forever, come waltz with me, come waltz with me once more 
Before we let love die forever, come waltz with me, the way we waltzed before 
Before our little world, just crumbled and fell 
And tumbled, like a house of cards to the floor 
Before I'm left to sigh forever, and haunt the past give me this last encore 
Oh darling come and waltz with me once more

 

FRANK SINATRA
CYCLES

 So I'm down and so I'm out 
But so are many others 
So I feel like tryin' to hide 
My head 'neath these covers 
Life is like the seasons 
After winter comes the spring 
So I'll keep this smile awhile 
And see what tomorrow brings 
 
I've been told and I believe 
That life is meant for livin' 
And even when my chips are low 
There's still some left for givin' 
I've been many places 
Maybe not as far as you 
So I think I'll stay awhile 
And see if some dreams come true 
 
There isn't much that I have learned 
Through all my foolish years 
Except that life keeps runnin' in cycles 
First there's laughter, then those tears 
 
But I'll keep my head up high 
Although I'm kinda tired 
My gal just up and left last week 
Friday I got fired 
You know it's almost funny 
But things can't get worse than now 
So I'll keep on tryin' to sing 
But please, just don't ask me how

DAYBREAK

 Daybreak, another new day, the mist on the meadow is drifting away, 
For it's daybreak, the sun's in the sky now, 
And flowers break through their blanket of dew, 
Sunrise, how lovely it seems, to see from my window a sky full of dreams, 
As the white clouds sail on through the blue, at daybreak I did dream of you.

 

FRANK SINATRA
DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES

 The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play 
Through the meadow land toward a closing door 
A door marked nevermore that wasn't there before 
 
The lone ly night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories 
Of the golden smile that introduced me to 
The days of wine and roses and you 
 
[brief instrumental break] 
The days of wine and roses 
[more instrumental rest of the first verse] 
 
The lonely the night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories 
Of the golden smile that introduced me to 
The days of wine and roses and you

DEAR HEART

 Dear heart, wish you were here to warm this night 
My dear heart, it seems like a year since you've been out of my sight 
A single room, a table for one 
It's a lonesome town all right 
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door 
And dear heart, I want you to know 
I'll leave your arms never more 
(A single room, a table for one) 
(It's a lonesome town all right) 
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door 
And dear heart, I want you to know 
I'll leave your arms never more

DESAFINADO

 When I try to sing you say I'm off key 
Why can't you see how much this hurts me 
With your perfect beauty and your perfect pitch 
You're a perfect terror 
When I come around must you always put me down 
If you say my singing is off key my love 
You will hurt my feelings don't you see my love 
I wish I had an ear like yours 
A voice that would behave 
But all I have is feelings and a voice gone deaf 
You insist my music goes against the rules 
But rules were never meant for lovesick fools 
I wrote this little song for you but you don't care 
Its a crooked song oh but all my love is there 
The thing that you would see if you would play your part 
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart 
I took your picture with my trusty Rollaflex 
And now all I have developed is a complex 
Possibly in vain I hope you weaken oh my love 
And forget these rigid rules that undermine my dream of 
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand 
That even though I may be out of tune 
When I attempt to say how much I love you 
All that matters is the message that I bring 
Which is my dear one I love you

DINDI

 Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds just wandering by, 
Where do they go? Oh I don't know, don't know; 
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes, 
Stories of love belong to you and to me. 
 
Oh, Dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful 
things that I see when you're with me, Oh my Dindi. 
Oh Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is 
singing Dindi, Happy Dindi, When you're with me. 
 
I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do; 
I'd let you go away, if you take me with you. 
 
Don't you know, Dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river 
that 
can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my Dindi. 
can't find the sea that would be me without you Dindi. 
 
Like a river that can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my 
Dindi.

DON'CHA GO 'WAY MAD

 I must confess what you say is true 
I had a rendezvous with somebody new 
That's the only one I ever had 
Baby, baby, don'cha go away mad 
 
Cheatin' shows and it never goes 
You got a reason to be mad I suppose 
But she only was a passin' fad 
Ba by, don't you be mad 
 
Her kind's a dime a dozen 
And that's not the kind I want 
Who'd ever dream your cousin 
Would wander into that restaurant? 
 
I understand that you feel upset 
Whaddya you say that you forgive and forget? 
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad 
Baby, baby don'cha go away mad

Now, her kind's a dime a dozen

Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad 
Baby, don'cha go away mad

DON'T BE A DO BADDER (FINALE)

 Take it from me, don't be a do badder up, 
Do badder up, do bother to put your foot up. 
That ladder that leads you to that place. 
Below and every day you lose other you. 
Feel sadder you get madder so use the other. 
Step ladder you climb the other way. 
Scrapping and fighting, scratching and fighting, 
Cheating and acting. selfish makes your heart. 
Like a part of the hardest heart, so selfish. 
Take it from me, don't you be a do badder up, 
A do badder up, a do badder up, just step up for that. 
Step ladder and climb the other way.

 April skies are in your eyes, but darling, don't be blue 
Don't cry, oh honey please don't be that way. 
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way 
The rain will bring the violets of May 
Tears are in vain, so honey please don't be that way 
As long as we see it through, you'll have me, I'll have you 
Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day 
Don't break my heart, oh honey, please don't be that way

You got to realize this is the wind up, 
You're gonna feel much better once you made your mind up. 
Don't cry, Joe, let her go, let her go, let her go. 
So you lost your gal, it's happened many times before, 
So you sit and mope like a dope, what's that good for, 
Get a hold of yourself, forget her, you lived long before you met her. 
There're lots of other girls, so I say, 
Don't cry, Joe, let her go, let her go, let her go. 
Don't cry, Joe, let her go, let her go, let her go. 
You got to realize this is the wind up, 
You'll feel much better once you made your mind up. 
Don't cry, Joe, let her go, let her go, let her go. 
 
Take a look around and see just what you're missing, 
You'll soon forget your troubles, Joe, if you'd only listen. 
So don't cry, Joe, let her go, let her go, Joe, let her go.

DON'T EVER GO AWAY (POR CAUSA DE VOCE)

 Ah take a look and you'll see the way I have become and the way things became 
Sadness and sorrow are here in the little things you touched with your hands 
This loving home was a home so happy to protect you and keep you with care 
The flowers in the window were smiling were glowing just knowing you were there 
Listen my love nevermore Don't ever go away 
Cause we are you are your life and your dream and we want you to stay 
Come in my love come to me don't let this heartless world 
bring another good bye 
Embrace me in a simple way 
Don't speak don't remember and darling don't cry

 

FRANK SINATRA
DON'T SLEEP IN THE SUBWAY

 You wander around on your own little cloud 
When you don't see the why or the wherefore 
You walk out on me when we both disagree 
'Cause to reason is not what you care for 
I've heard it all a million times before 
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door 
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain 
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long 
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong 
Now you're beside me again 
 
You try to be smart, then you take it to heart 
'Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated 
You don't realize that it's all compromise 
And the problems are so overrated 
Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show 
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go 
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain 
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long 
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong 
Now you're beside me again 
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'...

 

FRANK SINATRA
DON'T TAKE YOUR LOVE FROM ME

 Tear a star from out the sky and the sky feels blue 
Tear a petal from a rose and the rose weeps, too 
Take your heart away from mine and mine will surely break 
My life is yours to make, so, please keep the spark awake 
 
Would you take the wings from birds so that they can't fly? 
Would you take the ocean's roar and leave just a sigh? 
All this your heart won't let you do 
This is what I beg of you 
Please don't take your love from me 
 
[instrumental strings] 
 
All this your heart won't let you do 
This is what I beg of you 
Don't take your love from me

 

FRANK SINATRA
DON'T WAIT TOO LONG

 You are the summer and I am the autumn 
Don't wait too long 
Your song's beginning while mine's nearly sung 
Don't wait too long 
 
Fall is a lovely time of the year 
When leaves turn to golden brown 
But soon fall is ending and winter is near 
And the leaves start tumblin' down 
 
Why must the moments go by in such haste? 
Don't wait too long 
Winter is coming, I've no time to waste 
Don't wait too long 
 
So while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song 
Share every precious moment with me, don't you wait too long 
 
[instrumental first line of a verse] 
Don't wait too long 
[instrumental second line of a verse] 
Don't wait too long 
 
So while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song 
Share every precious moment with me, don't wait too long.

DOWNTOWN

 When you're alone and life is making you lonely 
You can always go downtown 
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry 
Seems to help, I know downtown 
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city 
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty 
How can you lose? 
 
The lights are much brighter there 
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares 
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're 
Downtown no finer place, for sure 
Downtown everything's waiting for you 
 
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you 
There are movie shows downtown 
Maybe you know some little places to go to 
Where they never close downtown 
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova 
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over 
Happy again 
 
The lights are much brighter there 
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares 
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright 
Downtown waiting for you tonight 
Downtown you're gonna be all right now 
 
[instrumental] 
 
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you 
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to 
Guide them along 
 
So maybe I'll see you there 
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares 
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're 
Downtown don't wait a minute for 
Downtown everything's waiting for you 
Downtown, downtown, downtown, downtown ...

DREAM AWAY

 Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild 
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you. 
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild 
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you. 
 
For the last time we have tasted 
love's sweet tears by the fire's glow. 
If our hearts are strong there'll be 
no long good byes when it's time to go. 
But the strongest torch is sometimes broken 
As the deepest vows aren't always spoken, 
And the greatest wounds, we hide inside ourselves 
Where they never show. 
 
Dream away, child, let your dreams run wild. 
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you. 
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild 
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you. 
 
When the Winter weds the Northern Wind 
The child they bear is snow. 
And the branches bow like worried bridesmaids 
But the trees will grow. 
Sun and Earth in time will come together, 
God will give us back our summer weather, 
But the mem'ries of that first sweet 
Taste of love pass away so slow. 
 
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild 
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you. 
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild 
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you. 
 
When there's no room left to live inside ourselves 
Do we dream away.

DRINKING AGAIN

 Drinkin' again and thinkin' of when, when you loved me 
I'm havin' a few and wishin' that you were here 
 
Makin' the rounds, accepting a round from strangers 
Bein' a fool just hopin' that you'll appear 
 
Sure, I can borrow a smoke, maybe tell some joker a bad joke 
But nobody laughs, they don't laugh at a broken heart 
 
Oh, yeah, I'm drinkin' again, it's always the same 
That same old story 
After the kicks there's little old mixed up me 
Tryin' to lose a dream that used to be 
 
Look at me, I'm drinkin' again, drinkin' all over town 
Yeah, I'm drinkin' again

DRINKING WATER (AQUA DE BEBER)

 Your love is rain, my heart the flower, I need your love or I will die 
My very life is your power, will I wither and fade or bloom to the sky 
Aqua de Beber, Give the flower water to drink 
Aqua de Beber, Give the flower water to drink 
The rain can fall on distant deserts, the rain can fall upon the sea 
The rain can fall upon the flower, since the rain has to fall let it fall on me 
Aqua de Beber, Give the flower water to drink 
Aqua de Beber, Give the flower water to drink

DRY YOUR EYES

 Dry your eyes, and take your song out, it's a newborn afternoon. 
If you can't recall the singer, you can still recall the tune. 
Dry your eyes and play it slowly, like you're marching off to war, 
Sing it like you know he'd want it, like we sang it once before. 
From the center of the circle to the midst of the waving crowd. 
If it ever be forgotten, sing it long and sing it loud. 
Come, dry your eyes. 
And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know. 
But we came to find the secret and we never let it go. 
And it was more than being holy, though it was less than being free, 
And if you can't recall the reason, can you hear the people sing, 
Through the lightning and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon, 
To that distant calling angel who descended much too soon. 
And come, dry your eyes. 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
Come, dry your eyes.

EARLY AMERICAN

 The dream I'm building is Early American, 
Something that won't go out of style, 
It makes you feel that life's worth living, 
The way they must have felt that first Thanksgiving. 
You sure get sold on this Early American, 
After you've looked around a while, 
So I'm building a dream for someone who 
Like Early Americans do.

EAST OF THE SUN (AND WEST OF THE MOON)

 East of the sun and west of the moon, 
We'll build a dream house so lovely 
Near to the sun in a day, near to the moon at night, 
We'll live in a lovely way dear 
Living our love in memory 
Just you and I, forever and a day, 
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way, 
Up among the stars we'll find 
A harmony of life, too lovely tune 
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear, 
East of the sun and west of the moon.

ELIZABETH

 Dressed in dreams for me, you were what I wished to see, Elizabeth, Elizabeth 
Love was very new, make believe was coming true, Elizabeth, Elizabeth 
You were all much too much, out of reach and out of touch 
When you came to me, I found it could never be, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth 
So a dream has to end when it's real, not pretend, dressed in memories 
You are what you used to be, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth

EMILY

 Emily, Emily, Emily 
Has the murmuring sound of May 
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels 
And the laughter of children at play 
 
They say Emily, Emily, Emily 
And we fade to a marvelous view 
Two lovers alone and out of sight 
Seeing images in the firelight 
As my eyes visualize a family 
They see dreamily, Emily 
 
[instrumental break] 
 
Two lovers alone and out of sight

EMPTY IS

 [Speaks:] 
Empty is the sky before the sun wakes up. 
Empty is the eyes of animals in cages. 
Empty, faces of women mourning 
When everything's been taken from them. 
Me, don't ask me about empty. 
 
[Sings:] 
Empty is a string of dirty days 
Held together by some rain. 
And the cold winds drumming at the trees again. 
Empty is the color of the fear 
Long about September when the days 
Go marching in a line toward November. 
Empty is the hour before sleep chills you every night 
And pushes you to take me away from every kind of light. 
Empty is me. 
Empty is me.

 

FRANK SINATRA
EMPTY TABLES

 It's like singin' to empty tables 
Or a gallery full of ghosts 
Or like givin' a great big party 
Where nobody shows but the host 
That's what it's been like, baby 
That's what it's been like all night 
Without you around to applaud me 
Every night's just like closing night 
 
And I'm singin', singin' the same old numbers 
 n' I'm tellin' the same sad jokes 
And there's nothin' out front but mem'ries 
And lot of transparent folks 
So, please call, call and make a reservation 
In our favorite spot for two 
 cause I'm singin' to empty tables without you 
 
Without you 
Without you

EV'RYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO BE WRONG! (AT LEAST ONCE)

 Everybody has the right to be wrong at least once 
Everybody has the right to be dunce like, once like 
Not being too smart is, is no disgrace 
What sets you apart is smilin' with egg on your face 
 
Its naive to make believe that you're right, it's not bright 
Only fools go walking on thin ice, twice 
 
You and life can skip the strife and you'll both get along 
All it takes is simply saying you're wrong when you're wrong 
And everybody has the right to be wrong 
 
[brief musical interlude] 
 
You and life can skip the strife and you'll both get along 
All it takes is simply sayin' you're wrong when you're wrong 
And everybody has the right to be 
It can be a real delight to be 
And I'd fight, fight for the right to be wrong 
 
[Spoken:] 
 At least once!

EVERYBODY OUGHT TO BE IN LOVE

 Empty rooms behind me, no more nights alone, 
A table and some chairs for two, 
Now the world will find me with someone of my own, 
The loneliness at last, is through, 
If everyone had someone just like you, 
Then everyone would feel the way I do, 
 
 
Imagine having someone always by your side. 
A bed for one can just be so cold. 
Someone you can talk to when your hands are tied, 
Someone there to have and hold. 
There's nothing more rewarding to produce (when you're in love and you hear) 
(I love you) 
 
 
(Somebody to love) 
There's nothing more rewarding to produce (when you're in love and you hear) 
(I love you)

EVERYBODY'S TWISTIN'

 Weeell,. they have to have something new, 
A dance to do for recreation so someone started twistin', 
A cat who was really hep, puts down a step 
To new gyration soon, all the kids were twistin', 
It didn't take long before the grown ups were trying it, 
Who's who was buying it all over town, 
You see them, a squirming and a worming and a twistin' around, 
It spread like a fire, its place became a craze 
That rocks the nation now, everybody's twistin'.

Well oh well oh well oh well, they had to have something new,

And a cat who was really hep, he puts down a step 
To new gyration soon, all the kids were twistin', 
No, it didn't take long before the grown ups were trying it, 
Who's who was buying it all over town, 
You see them, a squirming and a worming and a twisting around 
It spread like a fire, its place became a craze

Here's a hopping, and a stopping, and a poppin', 
Sacro really, ax a bopping, everybody's twistin'. Bop!

EVERYTHING HAPPENS TO ME

 I make a date for golf 
You can bet you life it rains. 
I try to give a party 
And the guy upstairs complains. 
I guess I'll go thru life; 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains, 
Ev'rything happens to me. 
 
I never miss a thing 
I've had measles and the mumps. 
And ev'ry time I play my ace 
My partner always trumps. 
I guess I'm just a fool; 
Who never looks before he jumps, 
Ev'rything happens to me. 
 
At first my heart tho't; 
You could break this jinx for me. 
That love would turn the trick; 
To end my despair. 
But now, I just can't fool; 
This head that thinks for me. 
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air. 
 
I've telegraphed and called; 
I sent air mail special, too; 
You answer was goodbye 
And there was even postage due. 
I fell in love just once; 
And then it had to be with you, 
Ev'rything happens to me.

FALLING IN LOVE WITH LOVE

 I weave with brightly colored strings 
To keep my mind off other things 
So, ladies, let your fingers 
dance 
And keep your hands out of romance 
 
Lovely witches 
Let the stitches 
Keep your fingers under 
control 
Cut the thread, but leave 
The whole heart whole 
 
Merrry maids can sew and sleep 
Wives can only 
sew and weep 
Falling in love with love 
Is falling for make believe 
Falling in love with love 
Is 
playing the fool 
 
Caring too much is juvenile fancy 
Learning to trust is just 
For children in school 
I 
fell in love with love one night 
When the moon was full 
I was unwise with eyes 
Unable to see 
 
I fell 
in love with love 
With love everlasting 
But love fell out with me

Hey Mr. Sunlight, don't outshine your bright, 
I'm talking out of my head, I'm so high on life. 
Don't you know that it's gonna be a thousand and one day. 
And I'm feeling kinda Sunday, (feeling kinda Sunday), feeling kinda Sunday. 
Pardon my glow on, out on the high all night, 
I see myself in a world right where I belong, 
There's nothing can hold me down , it's a get up and run day. 
And I'm feeling kinda Sunday (Sunday), feeling kinda Sunday (Sunday), 
Feeling kinda Sunday, (Sunday). 
The bells I hear in me say I should be getting up late, 
Been traveling all morning long, but I'm still here in my room. 
Not to give in to (in to) this feeling I'm on to, (I'm on to) 
I'm looking at love from a window, to lighten the view, 
It's just the beginning of happy go Sunday, 
And I'm feeling kinda Sunday (feeling kinda Sunday), 
Feeling kinda Sunday (feeling kinda Sunday), 
Feeling kinda Sunday (feeling kinda Sunday).

FLY ME TO THE MOON (IN OTHER WORDS)

 Fly me to the moon 
Let me play among the stars 
Let me see what spring is like 
On a Jupiter and Mars 
In other words, hold my hand 
In other words, baby, kiss me 
 
Fill my heart with song 
And let me sing for ever more 
You are all I long for 
All I worship and adore 
In other words, please be true 
In other words, I love you

FOLLOW ME

 Through the clouds, gray with years, over hill, wet with tears, 
To a world young and free, we shall fly, follow me. 
April green, everywhere, April songs always there, 
Come and hear, come and see, follow me. 
To the tree where our hopes hang high, 
To the dream that should never die, 
Where our long lost tomorrows still are in the sweet bye and bye. 
Time goes by, or do we, close your eyes, and you'll see 
As we were, we can be, weep no more, follow me. 
Follow me, follow me.

FOR A WHILE

 Lost in day to day, turn another way 
With a laugh, a kind hello, some small talk with those I know 
I forget that I'm not over you for a while 
A wave an easy grin, a smile to put them in 
With other lives to listen to and some work I've got to do 
I forget that I'm not over you for a while 
Days go by with no empty feeling until I remember you're gone 
People say to me, you need company 
When you have some time to spend, drop around and meet a friend 
They forget that I'm not over you for a while 
They forget that I'm not over you for a while...

 

FRANK SINATRA
FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE

 For once in my life I've got someone who needs me, someone I've needed so long 
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me, and somehow I know I'll be strong 
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of 
Long before I knew someone warm like you 
Could make my dreams come true 
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me, not like it's hurt me before 
For once I've got someone I know won't desert me, and I'm not alone anymore 
For once I can say: This is mine you can't take it 
As long as I've got love I know I can make it 
For once in my life I've got someone who needs me

 

FRANK SINATRA
FOR THE GOOD TIMES

 Don't look so sad, I know it's over 
But life goes on and this old world will keep on a turnin' 
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together 
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning 
 
 Lay your head upon my pillow 
 Hold your warm and tender body close to mine 
Hear the whisper of the raindrops flowing soft against the window 
And make believe you love me one more time 
For the good times 
 
I'll get along, you'll find another 
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me 
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever 
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me 
 
 Lay your head upon my pillow 
 Hold your warm and tender body close to mine 
Hear the whisper of the raindrops flowing soft against the window 
And make believe you love me one more time 
For the good times 
 
(For the good times) 
 
 For the good times

FORGET DOMANI

 Let's forget about tomorrow

Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes

The moonlight, let's share the moonlight 
Perhaps together we will never be again 
 
Ah, che luna, oh, che mare 
With such a moon and such a sea and you and me 
I get so dizzy when you're standing near 
It's not the music that you hear 
My heart is beating like a jungle drum 
Let's take the minutes as they speed away 
And hope it's true what people say 
 When you're in love, tomorrow never comes 
 
Let's forget about tomorrow 
Let's forget about tomorrow 
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes 
 
Let's forget about tomorrow

FORGET TO REMEMBER

 Pretend there is no silence, alone in your apartment 
Don't notice things that once were hers, 
Ignore the endless hours 
Don't chase the dream that your hearts were after, children's laughter 
 
Somehow believe in living, forget about the giving 
Just tell your life it must go on 
Run from yourself until you can't be found 
But don't remember, refuse to remember 
Forget to remember love

FROM PROMISE TO PROMISE

 [music intro] 
 
I sometimes wonder why people make promises they never intend to keep. 
Not in big things, like love or elections, but in the things that count 
The newspaper boy who says he will save an extra paper, and doesn't. 
The laundry that tells you your suit will be ready on Thursday and it isn't. 
Love, well yes, but like everything else, we go from day to day, 
We move from promise to promise. 
I've had a good many promises now, so I can wait for the harvest. 
And some of them, they come about.

FUGUE FOR TINHORNS

 I got the horse right here, the name is Paul Revere. 
And here's a guy that says that if all weather's clear, 
Can do, can do, this guy says the horse can do. 
If he says the horse can do, can do, can do. 
I picked the Valentine, cause on the Morning Line, 
The guy has got em figured at five to nine 
But take the Epitaph, he went to buy a half, 
He's got it cold in here in the Telegraph. 
About Rivera's fight, I guess the sport's alright 
Suppose it all depends if it rained last night. 
I know it's Valentine, the morning works were fine 
You know the jockey's brother is a friend of mine 
But just a minute, boys, I got the feedback's choice, 
It says the great grandfather was Aqua Poise. 
I give you Paul Revere, and it's no bum steer 
It's from a man right here that's real sincere 
I picked my Valentine cause on the Morning Line 
The guy has got em figured at five to nine 
But take the Epitaph, he went to buy a half, 
He's got it cold in here in the Telegraph. 
Epitaph, Valentine, Paul Revere, I got the horse right here.

GENTLE ON MY MIND

 It's knowin' that your door is always open 
And your path is free to walk 
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag 
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch 
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled 
By forgotten words and bonds 
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line 
That keeps you in the back roads 
By the rivers of my memory 
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind 
 
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy 
Planted on their columns now that bind me 
Or something that somebody said because 
They thought we fit together walkin' 
It's just knowing that the world 
Will not be cursing or forgiving 
When I walk along some railroad track and find 
That you're movin' on the back roads 
 
By the rivers of my memory 
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind 
 
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines 
And the junkyards and the highways come between us 
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother 
'cause she turned and I was gone 
I still might run in silence 
Tears of joy might stain my face 
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind 
But not to where I cannot see 
You walkin' on the back roads 
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind 
 
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron 
In some train yard 
My beard a rustlin' coal pile 
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face 
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can 
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find 
That you're waitin' from the back roads 
By the rivers of my memory 
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

GIVE HER LOVE

 Give her sunshine in your smile 
Give her pleasure all the while 
Turn her thoughts from clouds of gray 
Give her strength to face each day 
 
Give her laughter be her friend 
Stay beside her till the end 
But, in giving all else above, 
Don't forget to give her love 
 
[instrumental first two lines of second verse] 
 
But, in giving all else above, 
Don't forget to give her love

GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTIAN

 When I was a leaner 
I sought truth night and day. 
I asked our Lord to help me 
And he showed me the way. 
Go, tell it on the mountain, 
Over the hills and everywhere. 
Go, tell it on the mountain: 
that Jesus Christ is born 
He made me a watchman 
Upon the city wall, 
and if I am a christian, 
I am the least of all 
Go, tell ...

 

FRANK SINATRA
GOIN' OUT OF MY HEAD

 Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head 
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head over you, over you 
 
I want you, want you to want me, I need you so badly 
I can't think of anything but you 
 
Goin' out of my head over you 
Out of my head over you 
Out of my head, day and night 
Night and day and night 
Wrong or right 
I must think of a way into your heart 
There's no reason why my being so shy should keep us apart 
 
And I think I'm goin' out of my head 
'cause I can't explain the tears that I shed over you, over you 
 
I see you each morning, but you just walk by me 
You don't even know that I exist 
 
Goin' out of my head over you 
Out of my head over you 
Out of my head, day and night 
Night and day and night 
Wrong or right, day and night 
Night and day and night 
Wrong or right, day and night 
Night and day and night 
Wrong or right

GOLDEN MOMENT

 You're young for a golden moment, you sigh and it flies away 
And then in the silent September, you dream of the music of May. 
You're young for a shining hour, but soon it's remember when, 
Take hold of that golden moment, 
For once it's gone, it never comes back again. 
(music interlude) 
Take hold of that golden moment, 
For once it is gone, it never comes back. 
You cry, still it won't come back, 
It's gone and never comes back again.

 

FRANK SINATRA
GOOD THING GOING

 It started out like a song, we started quiet and slow with no surprise, 
Then one morning I woke to realize we have a good thing going. 
It's not that nothing went wrong, some angry moment of course, but just a few, 
And only moments no more because we knew we had a good thing going. 
And if I wanted too much, was that such a mistake? 
Half the time you never wanted enough, oh wake up, I don't make that a crime, 
And while it's going along, you take for granted some love will wear away, 
We took for granted a lot, and still I say, it could have kept on growing, 
Instead of just kept on, we had a good thing going, going, gone. 
 
[musical interlude]

GOODBYE (SHE QUIETLY SAYS)

 There is no great big ending, no sunset in the sky 
There is no string ensemble, and she doesn't even cry 
And just as I begin to say that we should make another try 
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good bye 
There is no big explosion, no tempest in the tea 
The world does not stop turning round, there's no big tragedy 
Sitting in a coffee shop with cheesecake and some apple pie 
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good bye 
Good bye, said so easily, Good bye, said so quietly 
Good bye, good bye, good bye, just two always strangers avoid each other's eyes 
One still make believing, one still telling lies, she tells me that I'm not to blame 
But when I ask the reason why 
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good bye 
Good bye, said so easily. Good bye, said so quietly 
Good bye, good bye, good bye 
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good bye

GOODY GOODY

 So you met someone who set you back on your heels goody, goody 
You met someone and now you know how it feels goody, goody 
You gave him your heart too, just as I gave mine to you 
And he broke it in little pieces, now how do you do 
You lie awake just singing the blues all night goody, goody 
And you think that love's a barrel of dynamite 
Hooray and hallelujah, you had it coming to y'a 
Goody goody for him, goody goody for me 
I hope your satisfied you rascal you, I hope your satisfied 'cause you got yours

GRANADA

 Granada, I'm falling under your spell, 
And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell. 
Of an age the world has long forgotten, 
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today. 
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada. 
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada. 
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along, 
Entranced by the beauty before me, 
Entranced by a land full of flowers and song. 
When day is done and the sun touch the sea in Granada, 
I envy the blush of the snow clad Tierra Novada, 
Soon it will welcome the stars 
While a thousand guitars play a soft Carbinera. 
Then moonlit Granada will live again, 
The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay. 
(musical interlude) 
And soon it will welcome the stars 
While a thousand guitars play a soft Carbinera. 
Then moonlit Granada will live again, 
The glory of yesterday, romantic, gay Granada. 
 
[And these are the Spanish lyrics as sung by Placido Domingo:] 
 
Granada tierra soniada por mi. 
Mi cantarse vuelve hitana cuando es para ti. 
Mi cantar hecho de fantasia. 
Mi cantar flor de melancholia que yo te vengo adar. 
Granada tierra ensangrentada de sangre de toros. 
Mi bello conserva el embrujo de los ojos moros. 
Resuello rebelde hita0no y lleno de flores, y beso tu boca de grana, 
Tu blanco manzana que habla de amores. 
Granada manola hitana de coplas preciosas. 
No tengo otra cosa que darte que un rama de rosas. 
De rosas de suave fragancia que alleje amargo la virgen morena. 
Granada tu tierra esta llena de lindas mujeres de sangre del sol..

GUYS AND DOLLS

 Benny: Nathan, I cannot believe that a number one businessman like you 
Has fallen in love with his own fianc e. 
Nathan: Alright, so Adelaide is my weakness, can't you be tolerant that I should have a weakness? 
Because this weakness is a sad condition that affects guys all over the world?. 
Look, what's playing at the Roxy? 
I'll tell you what's playing in the Roxy. 
A picture about a Minnesota man so in love with a Mississippi girl, 
That he sacrifices everything and moves all the way to Malacksy. 
That's what's playing at the Roxy. 
Benny: What's in the daily news? I'll tell what's in the daily news. 
Story about a guy who bought his wife a small ruby, 
With what otherwise would have been his union dues. 
That's what's on the daily news. 
Nicely: What's happening all over? I'll tell you what is happening all over. 
Guys sitting home before the television set who used to be something of a rover. 
That is what's happening all over. 
All: What is the thing that has licked 'em? 
Nathan: And it looks like I am just another victim. 
 
Yes sir, when you see a guy reach for stars in the sky, 
You can bet that he's doing it for some doll 
When you spot a john waiting out in the rain, 
Chances are he's insane, as only a john can be for a jane. 
When you meet a gent paying all kinds of rent 
For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal, 
Call it bad, call it funny, but it's better than even money, 
That's the guy that's only doing it for some doll. 
When you see a Joe, saving half of his dough, 
You can bet they'll be minting it for some doll, 
When a bum buys wine like a bum can't afford, 
It's a cinch that the bum is under the thumb of some little broad 
When you meet a mug lately out of the jug, 
And he's still lifting platinum for the roll, 
Call its hell, call it heaven, it's a probable twelve to seven 
That's a guy that's only doing it for some doll. 
(musical interlude) 
When you see a sport and his cash has run short, 
You can bet that he's been blowing it on some doll, 
When a guy wears tails with the front gleaming white, 
Who the heck do you think he's tickling pink on a Saturday night, 
When the lazy slob gets a good steady job 
And he smells from Vitalis and Barbasol 
Call it dumb, call it clever, ah but you keep on forever, 
That's a guy that's only doing it for some doll, some doll, some doll, 
That's a guy that's only doing it for some doll.

HALLELUJAH, I LOVE HER SO

 Let me tell 'bout a gal I know, 
She's my baby and she lives next door. 
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up, 
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup. 
That's why I know, yes, I know, 
Hallelujah, I just love her so. 
When I'm in trouble and I got no friend, 
I know she'll go with me down to the end. 
Everybody asks me how do I know, 
I smile a damn and say she told me so. 
That why I know, yes I know, 
Hallelujah, I just love her so. 
Now if I call her on the telephone, 
Tell her that I'm all alone, 
By the time I count from one to four, 
I hear her on my door. 
In the evening when the sun goes down, 
When there ain't nobody hanging 'round, 
She just kisses me, and then holds me tight. 
And tells me, baby, everything's gonna be alright. 
That's why I know, yes I know, 
Hallelujah, I just love her so. 
That's why I know, yes I know, 
Hallelujah, I just, I love her so. 
That's why I know, yes I know, 
Hallelujah, I just love her so.

HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS

 Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
Let your heart be light 
Next year all our troubles will be 
out of sight 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
Make the yule tide gay 
Next year all our troubles will be 
miles away 
Once again as in olden days 
Happy golden days of yore 
Faithful friends who are dear to us 
Will be near to us once more 
Someday soon, we all will be together 
If the Fates allow 
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow 
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.

HELLO, DOLLY!

 Hello Dolly, well hello Dolly, 
It's so nice to have you back where you belong. 
You're looking swell, Dolly, we can tell, Dolly, 
You're still glowing, you're still crowing, you're still going strong. 
We feel the room swaying 'cause the band's playing 
One of your old favorite songs from way back when, 
Take a rap, fellows, find her an empty lap, fellows, 
Dolly'll never go away, Dolly'll never go away...

Hello Sax, this is Francis, Louie, 
It's so nice to see you back where you belong, 
You're back on top, Louie, never stop, Louie, 
You're still singing, you're still swinging, you're still going strong, 
You get the room swaying when you start in playing 
One of your great songs, your songs from way back when, 
Blow your horn, Louie, sing up a great big song, Louie, 
Promise you won't go away, promise you won't go away, 
Promise you won't go away again.

Oh yeah!

HELLO, YOUNG LOVERS

 Hello young lovers whoever you are 
I hope your troubles are few 
All my good wishes go with you tonight 
I've been in love like you 
 
Be brave young lovers and follow your star 
Be brave and faithful and true 
Cling very close to each other tonight 
I've been in love like you 
 
I know how it feels to have wings on your heels 
And to fly down the street in a trance 
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet 
And you meet, not really by chance 
 
Don't cry young lovers whatever you do 
Don't cry because I'm alone 
All of my mem'ries are happy tonight 
I've had a love of my own 
 
I've had a love of my own like yours 
I've had a love of my own

HERE'S TO THE BAND

 [Intro] 
Hear that music playing, listen to what it's saying 
Throughout the years I've made a lot of friends 
Many became famous, most of them go nameless 
But I dedicate this song to all of them 
I've sung with the best and I've had it all 
I've gone from neighborhood saloons to Carnegie Hall 
I've been down and out and I've been in demand 
But I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band! 
 
Those magical notes, those musical pearls 
I've sung with all the Counts, the Dukes, the Kings, and the Earls 
And the experience, I have to say, was grand 
But I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band! 
 
[Bridge] 
Strings soaring, horns boring 
Drums pounding in my ear 
 
To start at the ground and reach for the top 
To have such a wonderful career, I just gotta stop 
Stop and turn around to thank everyone that sits on the stand 
 cause I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band! 
 
[instrumental] 
 
Here's to those ladies and the gentlemen 
Here's to the AF of M 
I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band! 
Here's to the band!

HERE'S TO THE LOSERS

 Here's to those who love not too wisely, know not wisely, but too well 
To the girl who sighs with envy when she hears that wedding bell 
To the guy who'd throw a party if he knew someone to call 
Here's to the losers, bless them all 
 
Here's to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesn't show 
To the girl who'll wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe 
To the lonely summer lovers when the leaves begin to fall 
Here's to the losers, a bless them all 
 
Hey, Tom, Dick and Harry, come in out of the rain 
Those torches you carry must be drowned in champagne 
 
Here's the last toast of the evening, here's to those who still believe 
All the losers will be winners, all the givers shall receive 
Here's to trouble free tomorrows, may your sorrows all be small 
Here's to the losers, bless them all

HEY LOOK, NO CRYING

 Hey, look, no crying, though she has one foot out the door 
I should be crying, it ought to hurt a little more 
I should resent her, try to prevent her, whatever for? 
 
Hey, look, I knew it, she's not the type to hang around 
Some day she was bound to go 
With that fact in mind, my tears were never apropos 
 
Hey. look, no sorrow, I have been luckier than most 
And if tomorrow I still feel haunted by her ghost 
I will remember how I loved her and how it was 
Who needs crying? With those memories in tow 
Me, I'm flying, I got memories to show 
 
Hey, look, no crying 
Just Goodbye , I'm letting go

HOW INSENSITIVE (INSENSATEZ)

 How insensitive I must have seemed when she told me that she loved me 
How unmoved and cold I must have seemed when she told me so sincerely 
 
 Why she must have asked, did I just turn and stare in icy silence? 
What was I to say? What can you say when a love affair is over? 
 
Now she's gone away and I'm alone with a mem'ry of her last look 
Vague and drawn and sad I see it still, all her heartbreak in that last look 
 
[in Portuguese:] 
Ah, porque vocy foi fraco assim 
Assim tao desalmado 
 
What was I to do? What can one do when a love affair is over?

HOW LITTLE IT MATTERS HOW LITTLE WE KNOW

 How little we know 
How much to discover 
What chemical forces flow 
From lover to lover 
 
How little we understand what touches of that tingle 
That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle 
 
Who cares to define 
What chemistry this is 
Who cares with your lips on mine 
How ignorant bliss is 
 
So long as you kiss me (and) the world around us shatters 
How little it matters how little we know 
(How little we know, how little we know,...)

 

FRANK SINATRA
I BELIEVE I'M GONNA LOVE YOU

 As the morning casts a thousand bits of sunlight, 
And they shine like diamonds on the morning dew, 
I believe that every single one is mine alone to see, 
And I believe I'm gonna love you. 
If it seems that there are special stars for lovers, 
And we see them scattered cross midnight blue, 
I believe that out of all this world, there meant for you and me. 
I believe I'm gonna love you. 
I'll take you to a magic place where no one's ever been, 
Where there's carpets made of flowers, and music in the wind. 
If you wonder why I'm giving you these treasures, 
Because you're like no one else I ever knew, 
I believe that as we walk through time, the best is yet to come, 
As I believe I'm gonna love you. 
As I believe I'm gonna love you.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I BELIEVE IN YOU

 You have the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth, 
Yet there's that upturned chin and the grin of impetuous youth, 
I believe in you, I believe in you. 
I hear the sound of good solid judgment whenever you talk, 
Yet there's that bold, brave, spring of the tiger that quickens your walk, 
I believe in you, I believe in you. 
And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart, 
I've but to feel your hand grasping mine, and I take heart, 
I take heart to see the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth, 
Yet there's that slam, bang, tang, reminiscent of gin and Vermouth, 
Now I believe in you, I believe in you. 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
I believe in you, I believe in you, I believe, I believe in you.

I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LOSING YOU

 Is this the way our romance ends, 
I got the message when you said we could be friends, 
My love was true, I can't believe I'm losing you. 
We played a game, of give and take, 
But I stopped playing when my heart began to break, 
What can I do, I can't believe I'm losing you. 
Wish I could erase every little phase of love that's in the heart of me, 
Every little dream, every little theme, will always be a part of me. 
There's nothing left for me to do, 
We've passed the point of no return, and now we're through, 
It's still too new, I can't believe I'm losing you. 
It's still too new, I can't believe I'm losing you.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU

 I can't stop lovin' you, so I've made up my mind 
To live in memory of old lonesome times 
I can't stop wantin' you, it's useless to say 
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday 
Those happy hours that we once knew 
Though long ago, yeah they make me feel blue, 
They say that time heals a broken heart 
But time has stood still since we've been apart 
I can't stop lovin' you, yes so I've made up my mind 
To live in memory of old lonesome times 
I can't stop wantin' you, it's so useless to say 
So I'll just live my life, live my life in dreams of yesterday.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I CONCENTRATE ON YOU

 Whenever skies look gray to me and trouble begins to brew 
Whenever the winter winds become too strong 
I concentrate on you 
 
When fortune cries Nay, nay to me 
And people declare You're through 
Whenever the blues become my only songs 
I concentrate on you 
 
On your smile, so sweet, so tender 
When at first my kiss you do decline 
On the light in your eyes when you surrender 
And once again our arms intertwine 
 
And so when wise men say to me 
That love's young dream never comes true 
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong 
I concentrate on you 
 
[instrumental to end]

 

FRANK SINATRA
I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU

 My story is much too sad to be told, 
But practically everything leaves me totally cold. 
The exception I know is the case 
When I'm out on a quiet spree, 
Fighting vainly the old ennui, 
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face. 
 
I get no kick from champagne. 
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all. 
So tell me why should it be true 
That I get a kick out of you? 
 
Some, they may go for cocaine. 
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff 
It would bore me terrifically, too. 
Yet I get a kick out of you. 
 
I get a kick every time I see 
You standing there before me. 
I get a kick though it's clear to see 
You obviously do not adore me. 
 
I get no kick in a plane. 
Flying too high with some gal in the sky 
Is my idea of nothing to do. 
Yet I get a kick um you give me a boot I get a kick out of you.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I HAD THE CRAZIEST DREAM

 I had the craziest dream, last night yes I did, I never dreamed it could be 
Yet there you were in love with me 
I found (saw) your lips next (close) to mine so I kissed you (them) 
And you didn't mind it at all 
When I'm awake, such a break never happens, how long can a guy go on dreaming 
If there's a chance that you care, then please say that you do 
Say it and make my craziest dream come true

 

FRANK SINATRA
I HADN'T ANYONE TILL YOU

 I hadn't anyone till you, I was a lonely one till you 
I used to lie awake and wonder, if there could be 
A someone in this wide world, just made for me 
And now I see I had to save my love for you 
I never gave my love till you 
And through my lonely heart demanding it, Cupid took a hand in it 
I hadn't anyone till you 
And through my lonely heart demanding it, Cupid took a hand in it 
I hadn't anyone till you

 

FRANK SINATRA
I HAVE DREAMED

 I have dreamed that your arms are lovely 
And I have dreamed what a joy you'll be 
I have dreamed ev'ry word you'll whisper 
When you're close, close to me 
 
How you look in the glow of evening 
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view 
In these dreams I've loved you so 
That by now I think I know 
What it's like to be loved by you 
I will love being loved by you

In these dreams I've loved you so

I will love being loved by you

I HEARD THE BELLS ON CHRSITMAS DAY

 I heard the bells on Christmas day 
Their old familiar carols play, 
And wild and sweet the words repeat 
Of peace on earth, good will to men. 
 
I thought how, as the day had come, 
The belfries of all Christendom 
Had rolled along th' unbroken song 
Of peace on earth, good will to men. 
 
And in despair I bowed my head 
 There is no peace on earth, I said, 
 For hate is strong and mocks the song 
Of peace on earth, good will to men. 
 
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: 
 God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; 
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail 
With peace on earth, good will to men. 
 
Till ringing, singing on its way 
The world revolved from night to day, 
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime 
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO

 The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay, 
The glory that was Rome is just another day, 
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan, 
I'm going home to my city by the bay. 
 
[Chorus:] 
I left my heart in San Francisco, high on a hill it calls to me 
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars. 
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care. 
My love waits there in San Francisco, above the blue and windy sea, 
When I come home to you, San Francisco, your golden sun will shine for me.

I LIKE THE SUNRISE

 I like the sunrise 'cause it brings a new day, 
I like a new day, it brings new hope, they say. 
I like the sunrise blazing in the new start, 
Night time is weary, oh and so am I. 
Every evening I wish upon a star 
That my brand new bright tomorrow isn't very far. 
When that heavy blue curtain of night is raised up high, 
Out of sight, I like the sunrise, oh heavenly day, 
I like the sunrise, I hope it lights for me 
 
[Full musical interlude] 
 
Every evening I wish upon a star 
That my brand new bright tomorrow isn't very far. 
When that heavy blue curtain of night is raised up high, 
Way out of sight, I like the sunrise, so heavenly to see, 
I like the sunrise, I hope it lights for me. 
I hope it lights for me.

I LIKE TO LEAD WHEN I DANCE

 A little voice, keeps talking to me from way down deep inside, 
What does this voice, keep saying to me? It says: pass this affair and pass it wide. 
You may be a puzzle, but I like the way the parts fit. 
Still that little voice says: Go get your track shoes put them on and git. 
We could go the distance, and find us romance, 
I like your persistence, your style and your stance. 
There's only one problem, the tiniest problem, I like to lead when I dance. 
Your eyes do the speaking, they talk with each glance, 
My will power's creaking, I might take a chance. 
And though you're the charmer who could bend my armor 
I like to lead when I dance. 
I like to steer the car whenever I drive, and hold the door ajar when we arrive. 
So if it's decided that this is romance, my sweet, I'll repeat in advance, 
I like to lead when I dance. 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
I like to lead when I dance. 
When Adam bit the fruit, as fashions were then 
He got that fig leaf suit, for which. Amen. 
So if it's decided I'm wearing the pants, then Eve, I'd say we've got romance 
I like to lead, I set the speed, I like to lead when I dance. 
When I dance, when I dance, when I dance.

I LOVE MY WIFE

 My thoughts may stray 
My eyes may roam 
The neighbor's grass may seem much greener 
Than the grass right here at home 
 
If pretty girls excite me 
Well, that's life 
But just in case, you didn't know 
I love my wife 
 
My mind at times 
May dwell on sex 
If someone's rating dreams 
Then most of mine I guess are double X 
 
So dimpled knees delight me 
Well, that's life 
But just in case, you hadn't heard 
I love my wife 
 
Like bait that wriggles 
And it makes catfish bite 
A lady jiggles 
And my eyes gotta light 
Upon so sweet a sight 
 
And if I shake 
Break out in spots 
Don't fret, it's not swine fever dear 
Your swine has merely got the hots 
 
If rosy lips invite me 
Well, that's life 
But just in case, you couldn't guess 
I love my wife 
 
My mind at times 
May dwell on sex 
If someone's rating dreams 
Then most of mine I guess are double X 
 
If rosy lips invite me 
Well, that's life 
But just in case, you couldn't guess 
Or hadn't heard 
Or didn't know 
I love my wife 
I love my wife 
I love my wife 
 
mmm 
I love my wife

 

FRANK SINATRA
I LOVE YOU

 I love you. I love you. 
Is all that I can say. 
I love you. I love you. 
The same old worlds I'm saying in the same old way. 
 
I love you. I love you. 
Three words that are divine. 
And now, my dear, I'm waitin' to hear 
The words that will make you mine. 
 
Little girl, I love you. 
Can't you see I love you. 
I love you. Can't you see I love you. 
 
I love you. I love you. 
Three words that are divine. 
And now, my dear, I'm waitin' to hear 
The words that make you mine.

I LOVED HER

 She was Boston, I was Vegas, 
She was crepe suzette, I was pie, 
She was lectures, I was movies, but I loved her. 
She was Mozart, I was Macy, 
She was afternoon tea, I was saloon, 
She was Junior League, I was Dodgers, 
But I loved her morning, night and noon. 
Opposites attract, the wise men claim, 
Still I wish that we had been a little more the same. 
It might have been a shoot out war, 
If we had know each other more. 
She was polo, I was race track, 
She was museum, I was G.P. 
She did her best to change me 
Though she never never knew quite how, 
But I loved her, almost as much as I do now. 
 
[piano interlude] 
 
She was Wall Street, I was pawn shop, 
She was French champagne, I was beer, 
She knew much more that I did 
But there was one thing she didn't know, 
That I loved her, 'cause I never never told her so

 

FRANK SINATRA
I NEVER KNEW

 I always thought that I'd prefer single blessed ness 
Thought that I'd like to stay free 
I never thought my time would come to marry, 
No wedding bells for me, I've changed my mind after all, 
You are the one made me fall, for... 
I used to smile at all the songs that were popular, 
Nothing but love in each song, 
I used to think those kind of songs were foolish, 
Now I admit I'm wrong. 
Love songs are part of my plan, show me the minister man, for... 
 
I never knew I could love anybody, 
Honey, like I'm loving you; 
I couldn't realize what a pair of eyes and a baby smile could do. 
I can't sleep, I can't eat, 
I never knew a single soul could be so sweet, 
I never knew I could love anybody, 
Honey, like I'm loving you.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU

 My love must be a kind of blind love 
I can't see anyone but you 
And dear, I wonder if you find love 
An optical illusion, too? 
 
Are the stars out tonight? 
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright 
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear 
The moon may be high 
But I can't see a thing in the sky 
'Cause I only have eyes for you. 
 
I don't know if we're in a garden 
Or on a crowded avenue 
You are here, so am I 
Maybe millions of people go by 
But they all disappear from view 
And I only have eyes for you

 

FRANK SINATRA
I SEE IT NOW

 That year in Oakland High when I was seventeen 
The grass from there to San Jose was high and cool and green 
I see it now 
 
Too brash and young was I to know what time could mean 
The old Acacia, long cut down, was felt but never seen 
I see it now 
 
That world I knew is lost to me 
Loves have come and gone 
 
The years go racing by, I live as best I can 
And all at once I know it means the making of a man 
I see it now 
I see it now 
I see it now

 

FRANK SINATRA
I SING THE SONGS (I WRITE THE SONGS)

 I've been alive forever, and I sang the very first song, 
I put the words and the melodies together, I am music and I sing this song: 
I sing the songs that make the whole world sing, 
I sing the songs of love and special things, 
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry, 
I sing the songs, I sing the songs. 
 
My home is deep within you, and I've got my own place in your soul, 
Now when I look out through your eyes, 
 
I am young again even though I'm growing old. 
I sing the songs that make the whole world sing, 
I sing the songs of love and special things, 
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry, 
I sing the songs, I sing the songs. 
 
My music makes you dance, it gets your spirit to take a chance, 
And if the music's from the heart, it's a real fine way to start, 
It's from me, it's to you, it's from you, it's to me, 
It's a world wide symphony. 
 
I sing the songs that make the whole world sing, 
I sing the songs of love and special things, 
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry, 
I sing the songs, I sing the songs. 
I sing and the whole world sings, 
I sing the songs of love and special things, 
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry, 
I sing the songs, I sing the songs. I am music, and I sing the songs.

I WANNA BE AROUND

 I wanna be around to pick up the pieces when somebody breaks your heart, 
Somebody twice as smart as I. 
Somebody who will swear to be true like you used to do with me, 
Who'll leave you to learn that misery loves company, wait and see. 
I wanna be around to see how he does it when he breaks your heart to bits, 
Let's see if the puzzle fits, so fine, 
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet, 
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat, 
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine. 
That's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet, 
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat, 
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine, 
Like you, like you broke mine.

I WILL DRINK THE WINE

 Someone said, drink the water, but I will drink the wine. 
Someone said, take a poor man, rich don't have a dime. 
So fool yourselves if you will, I just haven't got the time. 
If you can drink the water, I will drink the wine. 
Someone gave me some small flowers, I held them in my hand. 
I looked at them for several hours, I didn't understand. 
So fool yourselves if you will, you can hold out your hand, 
I'll give back your flowers, and I will take the land. 
And I will drink the wine. 
Sometimes I'm very very lonely, there's only me to care. 
And when I'm very very lonely, I want someone to share, 
I'm going to drink the wine, I'm gonna take my time, 
And believe in a world that is mine. 
Someone gave me flowers, held them in my hand. 
Looked at them for many hours, didn't understand. 
Go on and fool yourselves if you will, you can hold out your hand, 
I'll give back your flowers, and I will take the land. 
And I will drink the wine, and I will take the land. 
I will drink the wine.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU

 The clock will tick away the hours one by one 
And then the time will come when all the waiting's done 
the time when you return and find me here and run........ 
(Straight to my waiting arms)

 

FRANK SINATRA
I WISH YOU LOVE

 Goodbye, no use leading with our chins, this is where our story ends, 
Never lovers ever friends. 
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day, but before you walk away, 
I sincerely want to say. 
 
I wish you bluebirds in the spring, to give your heart a song to sing, 
And then a kiss, but more than this, I wish you love. 
And if you like lemonade to cool you in some lazy glade, 
I wish you health, and more than wealth, I wish you love. 
My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be, 
So with my best, my very best, I set you free. 
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm, 
Most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love. 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm, 
Most of all, when snowflakes fall, hot time, I wish you love. 
All kinds of love, a whole gang of love.

I WISHED ON THE MOON

 Every night was long and gloomy, shadows gathered in the air 
No one ever listened to me, no one wondered did I care 
None in all the world to love me, none to count that stars that hung 
Then the moon came out above me and I saw that it was young 
 
I wished on the moon for something I never knew 
Wished on the moon for more than I ever knew 
A sweeter rose, a softer sky 
An April day that would not dance away 
 
I begged of a star to throw me a beam or two 
Wished on a star and asked for a dream or two 
I looked for ev'ry loveliness, it all came true 
I wished on the moon for you

I WON'T DANCE

 I won't dance, don't ask me 
I won't dance, don't ask me 
I won't dance, Madame, with you 
My heart won't let my feet do things that they should do 
 
You know what?, you're lovely 
You know what?, you're so lovely 
And, oh, what you do to me 
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore 
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor 
 
When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle 
'specially when you do the Continental 
But this feeling isn't purely mental 
For, heaven rest us, I am not asbestos 
 
and that's why 
I won't dance, why should I? 
I won't dance, how could I? 
I won't dance, merci beaucoup 
I know that music leads the way to romance, 
So if I hold you in arms I won't dance 
 
 
I won't dance, don't ask me, 
I won't dance, don't ask me 
I won't dance, Madame, with you 
My heart won't let me feet do things that they want to do 
 
You know what?, you're lovely, 
Ring a ding ding, you're lovely 
And, oh, what you do to me 
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore 
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor 
 
When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle 
'specially when you do the Continental 
But this feeling isn't purely mental 
For, heaven rest us, I am not asbestos 
 
and that's why 
I won't dance, I won't dance 
I won't dance, merci beaucoup 
I know that music leads the way to romance 
So if I hold you in arms I won't dance!!

I WOULD BE IN LOVE (ANYWAY)

 If I lived the past over, saw today from yesterday 
I would be in love anyway 
If I knew that you'd leave me, if I knew you wouldn't stay 
I would be in love anyway 
Sometimes I think, think about before 
Sometime I think, if I knew then what I know now 
I don't believe I'd ever change somehow 
Though you'll never be with me, and there are no words to say 
I'll still be in love anyway 
If I knew then what I know now, I don't believe I'd ever change 
Somehow if I knew then what I know now 
I don't believe I'd ever change somehow

I WOULDN'T TRADE CHRISTMAS

 I wouldn't trade Christmas, no no, never would I, 
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best, 
I wouldn't trade Christmas, no no, never would I, 
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best. 
It's time for the hollys of fun, and the folly or all of that jolly jazz, 
The people are glowing, the sand is now howing, each window is showing it has 
All the latest in choicing, the daddy invoicing and all that razzle that does, 
But I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for New Year's Day, 
Thanksgiving, Holloween and the rest. Christmas we love you the best. 
I wouldn't trade, no, no. never would I, wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best. 
The traffic gets poky, the turkey gets smoky, and all of that holy stuff, 
The people are shopping for things they'll be swapping like filigree boxes of snuff, 
Though you pour the hot toddy, to force everybody, though half of the toddy's enough, 
I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for Father's Day or Mother's, 
Valentine, and the rest, Christmas we love you the best. 
The jingle fell jingle you feel the old tingle, you buy the first single scene. 
The idea is clever but subways will never quite handle that huge evergreen. 
And the old office party, with Stanley and Molly keep drinking until they turn green. 
But I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for Labor Day, or Easter, Washington and the 
rest, Christmas we love you the best.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'LL BE SEEING YOU

 [opening instrumental] 
 
I'll be seeing you in all the old, familiar places 
That this heart of mine embraces all day through 
In that small caf , the park across the way 
The children's carousel, the chestnut tree, the wishing well 
 
I'll be seeing you in ev'ry lovely summer's day 
In everything that's light and gay 
I'll always think of you that way 
I'll find you in the morning sun and when the night is new 
I'll be looking at the moon but I'll be seeing you 
 
[instrumental to end]

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'LL FOLLOW MY SECRET HEART

 I'll follow my secret heart my whole life through, 
I'll keep all my dreams apart till one comes true. 
No matter what price is paid, what stars may fade above, 
I'll follow my secret heart, till I find love.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'LL NEVER SMILE AGAIN

 (I'll never smile again until I smile at you) 
(I'll never laugh again) What good would it do? 
 
For tears would fill my eyes 
My heart would realize 
That our romance is through 
 
(I'll never love again, I'm so in love with you) 
(I'll never thrill again to somebody new) 
 
Within my heart 
I know I will never start 
(To smile again) 
Until I smile at you

I'LL ONLY MISS HER WHEN I THINK OF HER

 I'll only miss her when I think of her 
And I'll think of her all the time 
Likely I'll spend my days hearing her turn of a phrase 
Things I found hard to praise, right now, would seem sublime 
 
The truth is 
 
I'll only miss her when some stranger laughs 
'cause it's still her laugh my heart hears 
Maybe in time, I guess, the longing will grow the slightest bit less 
And there will be moments, yes, when it disappears 
I'll bet I forget her completely 
In about a hun dred years 
 
Mm, mm, mm, mm

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'M BEGINNING TO SEE THE LIGHT

 I never cared much for moonlight skies, I never wink at fireflies, 
But now that the stars are in your eyes, I'm beginning to see the light. 
I never went for after glow, candle light on the mistletoe, 
But now when you turn the lamp down low, I'm beginning to see the light. 
Used to ramble through the park, shadow boxing in the dark, 
Then you came and caused a spark, that's a four alarm fire now. 
I never made love by lantern shine, I never saw rainbows on my wine, 
But now that your lips are burning mine, I'm beginning to see the light.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'M GETTING SENTIMENTAL OVER YOU

 Never thought I'd fall, but when I hear you call, 
I'm getting sentimental over you. 
Things you say and do just thrill me through and through, 
I'm getting sentimental over you. 
I thought I was happy I could live without love, 
Now I must admit, love is all I'm thinking of. 
Won't ypu please be kind, and just make up your mind 
That you'll be sweet and gentle, be gentle with me 
 Cause I'm getting sentimental over you.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'M GONNA MAKE IT ALL THE WAY

 I cried the day you left me and I still don't know what kept me 
From jumping off the highest bridge I know. 
My poor heart was breaking, I felt lower than a snake in, 
That is just about the lowest you can go. 
I finally stopped my drinking, fell down and started thinking, 
That it's no pay to relive yesterday. 
I tried to hide my sorrow, started living for tomorrow, 
I think I'm gonna make it all the way. 
You hurt me and abused me, took advantage of and used me, 
I swear it almost made a wreck of me. 
When I needed your devotion, you were never in the notion 
You were cold as any iceberg in the sea, 
Love to you had lost its splendor, my pride went out the window, 
When you left me, I kept begging you to stay. 
 
But now my heart is healing, and I got a real good feeling, 
I think I'm gonna make it all the way. 
My troubles came in bunches, I kept rolling with the punches, 
You'd shoot me down and I'd get back again. 
I tried to be your lover, in no time I did discover 
Your loving cup was not for me to win. 
Your kisses weren't the same but I kept kinda fan the flame, 
Till I just couldn't take another day, 
You can't blame me for trying, now I stopped my crying, 
I think I'm gonna make it all the way. 
I tried my best to take it, but my smiling face didn't make it, 
'Cause in my heart, I knew there was no hope, 
Each place reminded me of the memories of your love, 
I've come right to the end of my rope. 
That's when I met my new friend, she's just as much a true friend, 
Treats me like a lover here to stay. 
And it's working out so well now, you can go to hell now. 
This time I'm gonna make it all the way. 
Yes, this time I'll make it all the way. 
Yes. I think I'm gonna make it all the way, 
Baby, get out of my way.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'M GONNA SIT RIGHT DOWN AND WRITE MYSELF A LETTER

 I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter 
And make believe it came from you 
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet 
They're gonna knock me off my feet 
A lotta kisses at the bottom 
I'll be glad I got 'em 
 
I'm gonna smile and say I hope that you're much better 
And then I'll close the way I do 
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter 
And make believe that it came from you 
 
I'm gonna smile and say I hope that you're much better 
The I'll close with love the way you do 
I'm gonna sit right down and knock out a very large letter 
And make believe it came 
Although it's not the same 
I'll make believe it came from you

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'M NOT AFRAID

 One afternoon I came to hear 
You sing a soft song into my ear 
Who would have thought quite by chance 
We might engage in a loving dance? 
 
Coming together, coming apart 
Lost in diversions, dancing stars 
Caught in the quiet, off on our own 
Coming together, standing alone 
 
Are you afraid? 
I'm not afraid 
 
What about you, what about me? 
Two years from now where will we be? 
Each of us gone our separate ways 
Lost in a headlong passage of days 
 
Maybe we might give love a try 
Extending the moment before goodbye 
And for a gentle moment in time 
We'll take what pleasure people can find 
 
Are you afraid? 
I'm not afraid 
 
What is for real, what is false? 
All of us seem to be caught in a waltz 
Turning around, turning again 
When will the dancing ever end? 
 
As for us, you and me 
Our eyes are open, we can see 
Both of us know where we've been 
Why must we both go dancing again? 
 
[brief instrumental] 
 
Come join the dancing, come join the waltz 
Don't look too closely at my faults 
Why can't I die here in your arms? 
Safe from the night and safe from the dawn 
 
Back to the nothing that had no name 
Back to the nowhere from where I came 
Don't worry of me, I know what I am 
Where I'm goin' and where I've been 
 
I'm not afraid! 
I'm not afraid! 
No, I'm not afraid!

I'VE BEEN TO TOWN

 I've been to town, I've walked the highways and in the suburbs too. 
I've done somethings I never thought I'd ever do. 
Now as I stand here looking down at you, you ask me why it is I frown. 
I guess it's 'cause I've been to town. 
I've been to town beyond the boulevard and down the beach, 
I've learned some things that only time can teach, 
For instance, love is more than just a speech, 
It's got to find a common ground, 
I know 'cause I've been to town. 
Don't tell me any more, I can't waste any more years, 
I've seen my image in your eyes, 
Dissolve in disappointed tears. 
I've been to town, you ask me do I know the Milky Way, 
I do, and furthermore I'd like to say 
It isn't milky white, it's dingy gray, 
Especially when your world breaks down, 
I know because I've been to town.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'VE GOT MY LOVE TO KEEP ME WARM

 I've got my love to keep me warm, off with my overcoat, off with my glove, 
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love. 
My heart's on fire, the flame goes higher, but I can weather the storm, 
What do I care how much it may storm, I've got my love to keep me warm.

 

FRANK SINATRA
I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN

 I've got you under my skin. 
I've got you deep in the heart of me. 
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me. 
I've got you under my skin. 
I'd tried so not to give in. 
I said to myself: this affair never will go so well. 
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well 
I've got you under my skin? 
 
I'd sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of havin' you near 
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night 
And repeats, repeats in my ear: 
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win? 
Use your mentality, wake up to reality. 
But each time that I do just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin 
'Cause I've got you under my skin. 
 
[Musical interlude] 
 
I would sacrifice anything come what might 
For the sake of havin' you near 
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night 
And repeats how it yells in my ear: 
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win? 
Why not use your mentality step up, wake up to reality? 
But each time I do just the thought of you 
Makes me stop just before I begin 
'Cause I've got you under my skin. 
Yes, I've got you under my skin.

I'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE

 I've never been in love before, now all at once it's you, it's you forevermore. 
I've never been in love before, I thought my heart was safe, I thought I knew the score. 
But this is wine that's all too strange and strong, I'm full of foolish songs. 
And out my song must pour, so please forgive this helpless haze I'm in, 
I've really never been in love before.

 

FRANK SINATRA
IF

 If they made me a king I'd be but a slave to you 
If I had everything I'd still be a slave to you 
If I ruled the night, stars and moon so bright 
Still I'd turn for light to you 
 
If the world to me bowed yet humbly I'd flee to you 
If my friends were a crowd I'd turn in my need to you 
If I ruled the earth what would life be worth 
If I hadn't the right to you 
 
If I ruled the night, stars and moon so bright 
Still I'd turn for light to you 
 
If the world to me bowed yet humbly I'd flee to you 
If my friends were a crowd I'd turn in my need to you 
If I ruled the earth what would life be worth 
If I hadn't the right to you

 

FRANK SINATRA
IF I HAD YOU

 I could show the world how to smile 
I could be glad all of the while 
I could change the gray skies to blue 
If I had you 
 
I could leave the old days behind 
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind 
I could start my life anew 
If I had you 
 
I could climb a snow capped mountain 
Sail the mighty ocean wide 
I could cross the burning desert 
If I had you by my side 
 
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned 
Humble or poor, rich or renowned 
There is nothin' I couldn't do 
If I had you 
 
[instrumental first two verses] 
 
 
I could climb a snow capped mountain 
Sail the mighty ocean wide 
I could cross the burnin' desert 
If I had you by my side 
 
I could be a king uncrowned 
Humble or poor, rich or renowned 
There is nothin' I couldn't do 
If I had you 
 
Baby, if I had you

 

FRANK SINATRA
IF I SHOULD LOSE YOU

 If I should lose you, the stars would fall from the sky 
If I should lose you, leaves would wither and die 
The birds in May time they'd sing a mournful refrain 
And I would wander around hating the sound of rain 
With you beside me, the rose would bloom in the snow 
With you beside me, no winds of winter would blow 
I gave you my love and I was living a dream 
But living would seem in vain if I 
(Hating the rain if I) 
(All is in vain if I) 
If I ever lost you

 

FRANK SINATRA
IF YOU GO AWAY

 If you go away on this summer day, 
Then you might as well take the sun away; 
All the birds that flew in the summer sky, 
When our love was new and our hearts were high; 
When the day was young and the night was long, 
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song. 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. 
But if you stay, I'll make you a day 
Like no day has been, or will be again; 
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain, 
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind. 
Then if you go, I'll understand, 
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand, 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. 
If you go, as I know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning 
Till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love without loving you, 
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go, I'll be dying slowly till the next hello, 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. 
But if you stay, I'll make you a night 
Like no night has been, or will be again. 
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch, 
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much. 
But if you go, go, I won't cry, 
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye, 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. 
If you go away, as I know you must, 
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust, 
Just an empty room, full of empty space, 
Like the empty look I see on your face. 
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow 
If I thought it might have kept me by your side. 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.

 

FRANK SINATRA
IF YOU NEVER COME TO ME

 There's no use of a moonlight glow or the peaks where winter snows 
What's the use of the waves that break in the cool of the evening 
What is the evening without you, it's nothing 
It may be you will never come, if you never come to me 
What's the use of my wonderful dreams, and why would they need me 
Where would they lead me without you? To nowhere 
What's the use of my wonderful dreams, and why would they need me 
Where would they lead me without you? To nowhere.

 

FRANK SINATRA
IMAGINATION

 Imagination is funny, it makes a cloudy day sunny 
Makes a bee think of honey just as I think of you 
 
Imagination is crazy, your whole perspective gets hazy 
Starts you asking a daisy What to do, what to do? 
 
Have you ever felt a gentle touch and then a kiss 
And then and then, find it's only your imagination again? 
Oh, well 
 
Imagination is silly, you go around willy nilly 
For example I go around wanting you 
And yet I can't imagine that you want me, too 
 
[instrumental 0:32 to end]

IN THE BLUE OF EVENING

 In the blue of evening when you appear close to me, dear one, 
There in the dusk we'll share a dream reverie, 
In the blue of evening while crickets call and stars are falling, 
There 'neath the midnight sky you'll come to me. 
In the shadows of the night we'll stand, I'll touch your hand. 
And then, softly as your lovely eyes entreat, our lips will meet again. 
In the blue of evening, night winds above whisper I love you, 
There will we find romance in the blue of evening.

 

FRANK SINATRA
IN THE COOL, COOL, COOL OF THE EVENING

 Sue wants a barbecue, Sam wants to boil a ham, 
Grace votes for bouillabaisse too 
Jake wants a weinie bake, steak and the layer cake, 
And he'll get a tummy ache too. 
We'll rent a tent or a teepee, let the town crier cry. 
And if it's on a ditty, this is what I'll reply. 
 
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening, tell 'em I'll be there, 
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening, better save a chair. 
Oh, when the party's a getting a glow on, and singing fills the air, 
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right, 
You can tell 'em I'll be there. 
(musical interlude) 
Oh when the party's a getting a glow on, and the singing fills the air, 
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right, 
You can tell them I'll be there. 
In the shank of the night when the doing's all right, 
You can tell them I'll be there.

 

FRANK SINATRA
IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON

 In the shadow of the moon, there's a bright and shining place 
Where two hearts can learn to share love beyond all time and space. 
Though the candle barely glows through the haze, 
Touch my hand, what it plays. 
Till a woman and a man learn to think and feel as one, 
They must journey through the dark, then one day they'll find that sun. 
We can own each silver star up above, simply love me, my love. 
 
[brief instrumental] 
 
We can share the joy we're both dreaming of, if you'll love me, my love.

 

FRANK SINATRA
IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT

 In the still of the night as I gaze out of my window 
At the moon in its flight, my thoughts all stray to you 
In the still of the night while the world lies in slumber 
Oh the times without number when I say to you 
Do you love me, as I love you 
Are you my life to be that dream come true 
Or will this dream of mine will it fade way out of sight 
Just like that moon growing dim, on the rim of the hill 
In the still, still of the night.

 

FRANK SINATRA
IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING

 In the wee small hours of the morning, 
While the whole wide world is fast asleep, 
You lie awake and think about the girl 
And never, ever think of counting sheep. 
 
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson, 
You'd be hers if only she would call, 
In the wee small hours of the morning, 
That's the time you miss her most of all. 
 
[Musical interlude] 
 
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson,

INDIAN SUMMER

 Summer, you old Indian Summer 
You're the tear that comes after June time's laughter 
You see so many dreams that don't come true 
Dreams we fashioned when Summertime was new 
 
You are here to watch over 
Some heart that is broken by a word that somebody left unspoken 
You're the ghost of a romance in June going astray 
Fading too soon, that's why I say 
 Farewell to you, Indian Summer 
 
[extended sax solo] 
 
You are here to watch over

 Farewell to you, Indian Summer

INDISCREET

 Indiscreet it's indiscreet, to gaze at you each time we meet 
I've told my eyes they must disguise this yearning 
Yes it's indiscreet quite indiscreet, to find your touch so bitter sweet 
You're close to me and suddenly I'm burning 
While I ask myself: Where is your pride? irresistibly I'm drawn to your side 
And (Yes) it's indiscreet so indiscreet, but love is swift and time is sweet 
And oh my dear I crave the nearness of you 
To love you is why my heart must be so love me it can't be indiscreet

IT GETS LONELY EARLY

 When you're all alone 
All the children grown 
And, like starlings, flown away 
It gets lonely early, doesn't it? 
Lonely early, doesn't it? 
Ev'ry single endless day 
 
When your twilight nears 
And one face appears 
Turning winter years to May 
It gets lonely early, doesn't it? 
Lonely early, doesn't it? 
Still the old heart's young enough to say 
 
 It was really more than lovely, wasn't it? 
 Truly lovely, wasn't it? 
[strings] 
Ev'ry single lovely day

 

FRANK SINATRA
IT HAD TO BE YOU

 Why do I do, just as you say, why must I just, give you your way 
Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget 
It must have been, that something lovers call fate 
Kept me saying: I have to wait 
I saw them all, just couldn't fall 'til we met 
It had to be you, it had to be you 
I wandered around, and finally found the somebody who 
Could make me be true, and could make me be blue 
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you 
Some others I've seen, might never be mean 
Might never be cross, or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do 
For nobody else, gave me a thrill with all your faults, I love you still 
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you

IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SPRING

 I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm, I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string 
I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring 
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing 
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring 
I keep I were someone else, walking down a strange new street 
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to meet 
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams 
I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing 
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing 
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be spring 
It might as well be spring.

IT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND

 Once I laughed when I heard you saying 
That I'd be playing solitaire 
Uneasy in my easy chair 
It never entered my mind 
 
And once you told me I was mistaken 
That I'd awaken with the sun 
And ordered orange juice for one 
It never entered my mind 
You had what I lack, myself 
Now I even have to scratch my back myself 
 
Once you warned me that if you scorned me 
I'd say a lonely prayer again 
And wish that you were there again 
To get into my hair again 
It never entered my mind 
 
Once you warned me that if you scorned me

IT STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN

 It started all over again the moment I looked in your eyes 
It started all over again, the thrill we can never disguise 
The day that we parted, so broken hearted, will never return again 
Dreams I've delayed, promises made are starting anew just for you 
 
It started all over again the moment I held you so tight 
It started all over again when we kissed away the night till dawn's early light 
Now we're together, sweethearts forever, we'll build our romance anew 
It started all over again the moment I looked at you 
 
[instrumental]

IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR

 [spoken intro:] 
Here's an awfully pretty folk song 
 
When I was seventeen it was a very good year 
It was a very good year for small town girls and soft summer nights 
We'd hide from the lights on the village green 
When I was seventeen 
 
[brief instrumental] 
 
When I was twenty one it was a very good year 
It was a very good year for city girls who lived up the stair 
With all that perfumed hair and it came undone 
When I was twenty one 
 
[brief instrumental] 
 
Then I was thirty five it was a very good year 
It was a very good year for blue blooded girls 
Of independent means, we'd ride in limousines their chauffeurs would drive 
When I was thirty five 
 
[brief instrumental] 
 
But now the days grow short, I'm in the autumn of the year 
And now I think of my life as vintage wine from fine old kegs 
From the brim to the dregs, and it poured sweet and clear 
It was a very good year 
 
[brief instrumental] 
 
It was a mess of good years

IT'S A WONDERFUL WORLD

 [sung by Jo Stafford in one of Frankie's broadcasts] 
 
It's a wonderful world, I'm just walking on air 
Talk of heaven on earth, I've got more than my share 
Haven't got a care, happy all day thru 
It's a wonderful world, loving wonderful you

 

FRANK SINATRA
IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME

 It's the wrong time and the wrong place 
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face 
It's not her face, but such a charming face 
That it's all right with me 
 
It's the wrong song in the wrong style 
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile 
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile 
So it's all right with me 
 
You can't know how happy I am that we've met 
I'm strangely attracted to you 
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget 
Don't you want to forget someone, too? 
 
It's the wrong game with the wrong chips 
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips 
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips 
That if some night you're free 
Dear, it's all right 
Yes, it's all right with me

 

FRANK SINATRA
IT'S ALWAYS YOU

 Whenever it's early twilight, I watch till a star breaks through 
Funny, it's not a star I see, it's always you. 
Whenever I roam through roses, and lately I often do 
Funny, it's not a rose I touch, it's always you 
If a breeze, caresses me, it's really you strolling by 
If I hear a melody, it's merely the way you sigh 
Wherever you are you're near me, you dare me to be untrue 
Funny, each time I fall in love, it's always you

 

FRANK SINATRA
IT'S SUNDAY

 Drowsy morning sunlight, gentle kisses for my love 
It's Sunday, it's Sunday 
 
She needn't waken, I'll fix the eggs and bacon her way 
While she just dozes 
Lately I've taken to bringing her a flower on her tray 
She's fond of roses 
 
We'll talk away the morning, read the papers, misbehave 
Enjoying each other 
The world is ours to play in, we'll take a walk or stay in 
Long and lazy hours to have and hide away in for one day 
Thank goodness, it's Sunday 
 
[brief guitar solo] 
It is Sunday, it's Sunday 
[slightly longer guitar solo] 
 
Lately I've taken to bringing her a flower on her tray 
She's fond of roses 
 
We'll talk away the morning, read the papers, misbehave 
Enjoying each other

Long and lazy hours to have and hide away in for one day 
Thank goodness, it's Sunday

JUST AS THOUGH YOU WERE HERE

 [instrumental strings intro] 
 
I'll wake each morning and I'll promise to laugh 
I'll say Good morning to your old photograph 
Then I'll speak to you, dear, just as though you were here 
 
When purple shadows start to welcome the dark 
I'll take the same old stroll we took through the park 
And I'll cling to you, dear, just as though you were here 
 
But I know so well that distance and time will finally tear us apart 
The farther you go, the longer you stay, the deeper the doubts in my heart 
 
Each night before I wander off into sleep 
I'll bring to light the tears I've buried so deep 
Then I'll kiss you, my dear, just as though you were here 
 
[instrumental break horns, harp, and strings] 
 
And when I hear a lonesome train, I'm afraid 
I'll think of all those trips we never quite made 
Fragile dreams that we planned 
Then I'll reach for your hand 
Just as though, just as though you were here

 

FRANK SINATRA
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE

 [jazz tempo to start] 
 
Don't go changin' just to try to please me 
You never let me down before 
And don't imagine you're too familiar 
And I don't see you anymore 
 
I would not leave you in times of trouble 
We could have never come this far 
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times 
I'll take you any way you are 
 
I need to know that you will always be 
The same old someone that I knew 
What will it take until you believe in me 
The way that I believe in you? 
 
I said I love you , and that's forever 
And this I promise from my heart 
I could not love you, love you any better 
I love you just the way you are 
 
[instrumental] 
 
[slower with lush strings] 
I don't want clever, clever conversation 
I never want to work that hard 
I just want someone that I can talk to 
I want you just the way you are 
 
[instrumental to end]

L.A. IS MY LADY

 The music she moves to, is music that makes me a dancer 
I brought her my wildest of dreams, and she came up with the answer 
I leave behind a part of myself, whenever I leave her 
But oh, when I'm back in her arms 
She smiles and then I am home again 
 
'Cause L.A. is my lady, she's always there for me 
L.A. is my lady, she knows how to care for me 
No lady's sweeter you know it the moment you meet her 
I've been in love more times, than I care to remember 
And love's kept me cool in July and warm in December 
It may not have lasted, but each time I thought it was heaven 
You name it, I've been there and back 
Lookin' for someone who I'd be faithful to 
L.A. is my lady, she's always there for me 
L.A. is my lady, she knows how to care for me 
She's good to me yeah she's good to me, and that's why 
L.A. is my lady L.A. is my lady 
And you're lookin' at a man who doesn't ever plan to kiss his lady bye bye

LADY DAY

 Her day was born in shades of blue 
Her song was sad the words were true 
Her morning came too fast too soon 
And died before the afternoon 
Poor lady day could use some love, some sunshine 
Lady day has too much rain 
Poor lady day could use some spring, some breezes 
Lady day has too much pain 
It's such a lonely face 
Such a cloudy sky 
So many shadows in her eye 
So many empty dreams 
So many bitter times 
Just a handful 
Of broken rhymes 
Poor lady day could use a smile, some kindness 
Lady day has too much rain 
Poor lady day could use some dreams, some flowers 
Lady day has too much pain 
Just too much to say 
Just to much to know 
Too little time to say hello 
And then the evening comes 
And now she doesn't cry 
And it's too late to say 
Good bye

LAST NIGHT WHEN WE WERE YOUNG

 Last night when we were young 
Love was a star, a song unsung 
Life was so new, so real so right 
Ages ago last night 
 
Today the world is old 
You flew away and time grew cold 
Where is that star that shone so bright 
Ages ago last night? 
 
To think that spring had depended 
On merely this: a look, a kiss 
To think that something so splendid 
Could slip away in one little daybreak 
 
So now, let's reminisce 
And recollect the sighs and the kisses 
The arms that clung 
 
When we were young last night

 

FRANK SINATRA
LEARNIN' THE BLUES

 The tables are empty, the dance floor's deserted. 
You play the same love song it's the 10th time you've heard it. 
That's the beginning, just one of the clues. 
You've had your first lesson in learnin' the blues. 
 
The cigarettes you light, one after another, 
Won't help you forget her, and the way that you love her. 
You're only burnin' a torch you can't lose. 
But you're on the right track for learnin' the blues. 
 
When you're at home alone, 
The blues will taunt you constantly. 
When you're out in a crowd, 
The blues will haunt your memory. 
 
The nights when you don't sleep, the whole night you're crying. 
But you can't forget her, soon you even stop trying. 
You'll walk that floor and wear out your shoes. 
When you feel your heart break, you're learnin' the blues. 
 
When you're at home alone, 
The blues will taunt you constantly. 
When you're out in a crowd, 
Those blues will haunt your memory. 
 
The nights when you don't sleep, that whole night you're crying. 
But you can't forget her, soon you even stop trying. 
You'll walk the floor, and you'll wear out your shoes. 
When you feel your heart break, you're learnin' those blues.

LEAVING ON A JET PLANE

 All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go 
I'm standing here outside your door 
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye 
But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn 
The taxi's waitin', he's blowin' his horn 
Already I'm so lonesome. I could cry. 
 
[Chorus:] 
So kiss me and smile for me 
Tell me that you'll wait for me 
Hold me like you'll never let me go. 
I'm leavin' on a jet plane 
I don't know when I'll be back again 
Oh, babe, I hate to go. 
 
There's so many times I've let you down 
So many times I've played around 
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing 
Ev'ry place I go, I'll think of you 
Ev'ry song I sing, I'll sing for you 
When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring. 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Now the time has come to leave you 
One more time, let me kiss you 
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way. 
Dream about the days to come 
When I won't have to leave alone 
About the times, I won't have to say, 
 
[Chorus]

 

FRANK SINATRA
LET ME TRY AGAIN

 I know I said that I was leaving, 
But I just couldn't say good bye. 
It was only self deceiving 
To walk away from someone who 
Means everything in life to you. 
You learn from every lonely day 
I've learned and I've come back to stay. 
 
Let me try again; let me try again. 
Think of all we had before, 
Let me try once more. 
We can have it all, you and I again. 
Just forgive me or I'll die. 
Please let me try again. 
 
I was such a fool to doubt you, 
To try to go it all alone. 
There's no sense to life without you. 
Now all I do is just exist 
And think about the chance I've missed. 
To beg is not an easy task, 
But pride is such a foolish mask. 
 
Let me try again; let me try again. 
Think of all we had before, 
Let me try once more. 
We can have it all, you and I again. 
Just forgive me or I'll die. 
Please let me try again.

Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me.

LET'S FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE

 There may be trouble ahead 
But while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance 
Let's face the music and dance 
Before the fiddlers have fled, 
Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have that chance 
Let's face the music and dance 
Soon, we'll be without the moon, humming a different tune and then... 
There may be teardrops to shed 
So (But) while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance 
(Let's face the music and dance, dance) 
(Let's face the music let's here that music) 
Let's face the music and dance

LET'S FALL IN LOVE

 We might have been meant for each other 
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover 
I have a feelin', it's a feelin' I'm concealin', I don't know why 
It's just a mental, incidental, sentimental, alibi 
But I adore you, so strong for you 
Why go on stallin', I'm fallin', love is callin', why be shy? 
 
 
Let's fall in love 
Why shouldn't we fall in love? 
Our hearts are made of it 
Let's take a chance, why be afraid of it? 
 
Let's close our eyes 
And make our own paradise 
Little we know of it 
Still we can try to make a go of it 
 
Now, we might have been meant for each other 
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover 
 
Let's fall in love 
Why shouldn't we fall in love? 
Now is the time for it, while we are young 
Let's fall in love 
 
Let's fall in love 
Let's fall in love

LIFE'S A TRIPPY THING

 with [Nancy Sinatra], and (chorus) 
 
[Getting stoned on sunshine, getting high on air,] 
Getting to it naturally, really getting there, 
[Getting such a high on, loving what I do,] 
I'm so full of happiness, my hope's on something new, 
 
[Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering] (remembering, remembering). 
 
(ding a ling) 
[My pot is filled with flowers, my grass is bright and green,] 
My tears brewing in my cup, and still I make the scene. 
[But just don't try to change me, I love the world I found,] 
I've got to fly my own sweet way, and don't you shoot me down. [hahaha] 
 
(remembering, remembering). 
 
(a ding a ling, ding a ling, ding a ling). 
Don't pity me, I'm glad to be a ding a ling, [a ding a ling], (ding a ling, ding a ling). 
( ding a ling, ding a ling, ding a ling). 
Ding a ling, ding a ling, (ding a ling, ding a ling, ding a ling). 
Ha ha ha, that's silly.(ding a ling, ding a ling, ding a ling).

LIKE A SAD SONG

 Usually in the morning I'm filled with sweet belonging, 
And everything is beautiful to see. 
Even when it's raining, sounds of heaven singing 
Is simply joyful music to me. 
Sometimes I feel like a sad song, 
Like I'm all alone without you. 
So many different places, a million smiling faces, 
Oh life is so incredible to me. 
Especially to be near you and how it is to touch you, 
Oh paradise was made for you and me. 
Sometimes I feel like a sad song, 
Like I'm all alone without you. 
I know that life goes on just perfectly, 
And everything is just the way that it should be, 
Still there are times when my heart feels like breaking, 
And anywhere is where I'd rather be. 
Oh, and in the nighttime, I know that it's the right time, 
To hold you close and say, I love you so. 
To have someone to care with, someone I could share with, 
And that is why I wanted you to know, 
Sometimes I feel like a sad song, 
Like I'm all alone without you. 
 
[instrumental] 
 
Sometimes I feel like a sad song, 
Like I'm all alone without you.

Like I'm all alone without you, without you.

LINDA

 When I go to sleep, I never count sheep, I count all the charms about Linda. 
And lately it seems in all of my dreams, I walk with my arms about Linda. 
But what good does it do me, for Linda doesn't know I exist, 
Can't help feeling gloomy, think of all the lovin I've missed. 
We pass on the street ,my heart skips a beat, I say to myself, hello, Linda. 
If only she'd smile I'd stop for a while, and then I would get to know Linda. 
But miracles still happen and when my lucky star begins to shine. 
With one little kiss, I'll make Linda mine.

LITTLE GREEN APPLES

 And I wake up in the morning, with my hair down in my eyes, 
And she says hi, and I stumble to the breakfast table, 
While the kids are going off to school goodbye. 
And she reaches out and takes my hand, 
Squeezes it, says, how you feelin' hon? 
And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart and see my morning sun. 
And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say. 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime. 
There's no such thing as Dr. Zeuss, Disneyland, and Mother Goose no nurs'ry rhyme. 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis when the winter comes. 
There's no such thing as make believe, puppy dogs, and autumn leaves and B.B. guns. 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy 
And ask if she could get away and meet me, and grab a bite to eat. 
And she drops what she's doin' and hurries down to meet me, and I'm always late. 
But she sits, waiting patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
Cause she's made that way and if that's not lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say.

LONDON BY NIGHT

 London by night is a wonderful sight 
There is magic abroad in the air 
I'm often told that the streets turn into gold 
When the moon shines on * Circus and Square * 
 
Deep in the dark that envelops the park 
There's romance in each cigarette glow 
Down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems 
Seem to wink at each girl and her beau 
 
Up comes the moon when the city's asleep 
He's not alone, for it seems 
Somewhere up there stands an angel to keep her watch 
While each Londoner dreams 
 
My love and I saw the sun leave the sky 
Then we kissed in the fast fading light 
Most people say they love London by day 
But lovers love London by night

LONESOME CITIES

 There's a few more lonesome cities that I'd like to see, 
While the wine of wondering is still inside of me, 
There's a few more pretty women that I'd like to know, 
Bridge or two I'd like to cross, a few more oats to sow, 
Maybe when I've done it all, seen all there is to see, 
I'll find out I still cannot run away from me. 
But as long as trains keep running, restless man I'll be 
And there's a few more lonesome cities that I've yet to see. 
Maybe when I've done it all, seen all there is to see, 
I'll find out I still cannot run away from me. 
But as long as trains keep running, restless man I'll be

One or two more lonesome cities that I've yet to see.

LOOKING AT THE WORLD THRU ROSE COLORED GLASSES

 Looking at the world through rose colored glasses, 
Everything is rosy now. 
Looking at the world and everything that passes, 
Seems of rosy hue somehow. 
Why do I feel surprise, don't wink your eyes, 
Needn't guess I'll confess, certain someone just said yes. 
In a bungalow all covered with roses, I will settle down I vow, 
That's why I'm looking at the world through rose colored glasses, 
Everything is rosy now. 
 
[full instrumental interlude] 
 
Oh yes, I'm looking at the world through rose colored glasses, 
Everything is rosy now. 
Looking at the world and everything that passes,

LOST IN THE STARS

 Before Lord God made the sea or the land 
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand 
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand 
And one little star fell alone 
 
Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star in the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost no more 
 
Now, a man don't mind if the stars get dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him 
So long as the Lord God's watching over him 
Keeping track how it all goes on 
 
But I've been walking through the night and the day 
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray 
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away 
Forgetting his promise and the word he'd say 
 
And we're lost out here in the stars 
Little stars big stars blowing through the night 
And we're lost out here in the stars 
Little stars big stars blowing through the night 
And we're lost out here in the stars

LOVE AND MARRIAGE

 Love and marriage, love and marriage, 
Go together like a horse and carriage. 
This I tell ya, brother, you can't have one without the other. 
 
Love and marriage, love and marriage, 
It's an institute you can't disparage. 
Ask the local gentry and they will say it's elementary. 
 
Try, try, try to separate them, it's an illusion. 
Try, try, try and you only come to this conclusion: 
 
Love and marriage, love and marriage, 
Go together like a horse and carriage. 
Dad was told by mother you can't have one 
You can't have none. 
You can't have one without the other. 
 
[Musical interlude]

LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING

 Love is a many splendored thing, 
It's the April rose that only grows in the early spring, 
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living, 
The golden crown that makes a man a king. 
Lost on a high and windy hill, 
In the morning mist two lovers kissed and the world stood still, 
When our fingers touch my silent heart has taught us how to sing, 
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing.

LOVE IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER

 Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody, 
But can't you see, you've captured me. 
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me? 
Make it soon, take a look at the moon. 
 
Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner. 
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you. 
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be a loner, 
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you. 
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms, 
But strictly between us, you're outer than Venus, 
And what's more you got arms. 
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner, 
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you

LOVE ISN'T JUST FOR THE YOUNG

 Love isn't just for the young, 
It's for all who may wish upon a star, 
Love isn't just for the young, 
For true love doesn't ask how old you are. 
Doesn't matter if you're twenty or ninety two, 
You only need a heart to share, 
Then of course you need someone who feels like you, 
And who answers every dream and prayer. 
Love isn't just for the young, 
Never fear, let the whole world know it's spring. 
For love isn't just for the young, 
And there's, oh, so much joy that it can bring. 
Yes, the gold may have turned to silver, 
But if you still have songs left unsung, 
Just remember that love is for everyone, 
Love isn't just for the young.

LOVE MAKES US WHATEVER WE WANT TO BE

 Love makes us whatever we want to be, 
You and me the tip of the top of the tree, 
We can hit the target the others aim for, 
Be whatever they put your name in the for a fame for, 
What we are is absolutely unique, 
Looking at the world from the peak of the peak, 
We're about to make us some history 
So don't quiet it, just forget that wild on the story 
Listen to my poor heart imploring, 
I just need to know you're adoring me, 
Cause love makes us whatever we want to be. 
Hail those famous lovers, they've met their match, 
There in kindergarten just starting from scratch, 
We're about to solve the great mystery. 
So don't fight it, only close while heaven's deciding, 
Watching stars and planets colliding 
From this lovely rainbow we're riding free, 
Love makes us whatever we want to be. 
Love makes us whatever we want to be.

LOVE ME TENDER

 Love me tender, love me sweet, never let me go, 
You have made my life complete and I love you so. 
Love me tender, love me sweet, all my dreams fulfilled, 
For my darling, I love you and I always will. 
 
Love me tender, love me long, take me to your heart. 
For it's there that I belong and we'll never part. 
Love me tender, love me sweet, all my dreams fulfilled, 
For my darling, I love you and I always will. 
 
Love me tender, love me dear, tell me you are mine,

For my darling, I love you and I always will.

LOVE WALKED IN

 Love walked right in and drove the shadows away 
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day 
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello 
Though not a word was spoken 
 
One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past 
One look and I had found my future at last 
One look and I had found a world completely new 
When love walked in with you 
 
[instrumental first two lines of first verse] 
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

LOVE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME

 I have been a rover 
I have walked alone 
Hiked a hundred highways 
Never found a home 
Still in all I'm happy 
The reason is, you see 
Once in a while along the way 
Love's been good to me 
 
There was a girl in Denver 
Before the summer storm 
Oh, her eyes were tender 
Oh, her arms were warm 
And she could smile away the thunder 
Kiss away the rain 
Even though she's gone away 
You won't hear me complain 
 
I have been a rover 
I have walked alone 
Hiked a hundred highways 
Never found a home 
Still in all I'm happy 
The reason is, you see 
Once in a while along the way 
Love's been good to me 
 
There was a girl in Portland 
Before the winter chill 
We used to go a courtin' 
Along October hill 
And she could laugh away the dark clouds 
Cry away the snow 
It seems like only yesterday 
As down the road I go 
 
I've been a rover 
I have walked alone 
Hiked a hundred highways 
Never found a home 
Still in all I'm happy 
The reason is, you see 
Once in a while along the way 
Love's been good to me

LUCK BE A LADY

 They call you lady luck 
But there is room for doubt 
At times you have a very un lady like way 
Of running out 
Your on this date with me 
The pickin's have been lush 
And yet before the evening is over 
You might give me the brush 
You might forget your manners 
You might refuse to stay 
And so the best that I can do is pray 
Luck be lady tonight 
Luck be lady tonight 
Luck if you've been a lady to begin with 
Luck be a lady tonight 
Luck let a gentleman see 
Just how nice a dame you can be 
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with 
Luck be a lady with me 
A lady never leaves her escort 
It isn't fair, it isn't nice 
A lady doesn't wander all over the room 
And blow on some other guys dice 
Lets keep this party polite 
Never get out of my sight 
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with 
Luck be lady tonight 
A lady never flirts with strangers 
She'd have a heart, she'd be nice 
A lady doesn't wander all over the room 
And blow on some other guys dice 
Lets keep this party polite 
Never get out of my sight 
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with

MACARTHUR PARK

 Spring was never waiting for us, girl, it ran one step ahead as we followed in the dance, 
Between the parted pages that were pressed, 
A love hot fevered like a striped pair of pants, 
MacArthur Park is melting in the dark, all the sweet, green icing flowing down. 
Someone left the cake out in the rain, 
I don't think I could take it, cause it took so long to bake it, 
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh no! 
I still see the yellow cotton dress foaming like a wave upon the ground. 
Around your knees, and the birds like tender babies in your hands, 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees. 
There will be another song for me, for I will sing it. 
There would be another dream for me, someone will bring it. 
Oh, I will drink the wine while it is warm, 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun. 
But after all the loves of my life, after all the loves, you'll still be the one. 
I would take my life into my hands and I will use it, 
I will win the worship in their eyes, and I will lose it. 
I will have all the things that I desire, and my passions flow like rivers in the sky, 
And after the loves of my life, after all the loves of my life, 
You'll still gonna be the one. 
MacArthur Park is melting in the dark, all the sweet, green icing flowing down,

MACK THE KNIFE

 Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear 
And he shows 'em, pearly white 
Just a jack knife has Macheath, dear 
And he keeps it, keeps it way out of sight 
 
When that shark bites with his teeth, dear 
Scarlet billows, they begin to spread 
Fancy white gloves though has Macheath, dear 
So there's rarely, never one trace of red 
 
On the sidewalk, one Sunday mornin' 
Lies a body oozin' life 
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner 
Could that someone, perhaps, perchance, be Mack the Knife? 
 
From a tugboat on the river goin' slow 
A cement bag, it is dropping down 
Yeah, the cement is just for the weight, dear 
You can make a large bet Macheath is back in town 
 
My man Louie Miller, he split the scene, babe 
After drawin' out all the bread from his stash 
Now Macheath spends just like a pimp, babe 
Do you suppose that our boy, he did something rash? 
 
Ah, old Satchmo, Louis Armstrong, Bobby Darrin 
They did this song nice, Lady Ella too 
They all sang it, with so much feeling 
That Old Blue Eyes, he ain't gonna add nothing new 
 
But with Quincy's big band, right behind me 
Swinging hard, Jack, I know I can't lose 
When I tell you, all about Mack the Knife babe 
It's an offer, you can never refuse 
 
We got George Benson, we got Newman & Foster 
We got the Brecker Brothers, and Hampton's bringing up the rear 
All these bad cats, and more, are in the band now 
They make the greatest sounds, you ever gonna hear 
 
Hey Sookie Taudry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum, Old Miss Lulu Brown 
Oh the line forms, on the right dear 
Now that Macheath, I mean that man Macheath 
Yeah he's bad, mercy mercy 
Yeah he's badder than old Leroy Brown 
You better lock your door, and call the law 
Because Macheath's, that bum, 
He's back in town

ME AND MY SHADOW

 Like the wallpaper sticks to the wall 
Like the seashore clings to the sea 
Like you'll never get rid of your shadow 
Frank, you'll never get rid of me 
 
Let all the others fight and fuss 
Whatever happens, we've got us. 
 
Me and my shadow 
We're closer than pages that stick in a book 
We're closer than ripples that play in a brook 
Strolling down the avenue 
Wherever you find him, you'll find me, just look 
Closer than a miser or the bloodhounds to Liza 
 
Me and my shadow 
We're closer than smog when it clings to L.A. 
We're closer than Bobby is to J.F.K. 
Not a soul can bust this team in two 
We stick together like glue 
 
And when it's sleeping time 
That's when we rise 
We start to swing 
Swing to the skies 
Our clocks don't chime 
What a surprise 
They ring a ding ding! 
Happy New Year! 
 
Me and my shadow 
And now to repeat what I said at the start 
They'll need a large crowbar to break us apart 
We're alone but far from blue 
 
Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar 
We'll make all the late spots, and then a few more 
We'll wind up at Jilly's right after Toot's Shore 
Life is gonna be we wow whee! 
(here comes the party!) 
For my shadow and me! 
 
Say Frank? 
What is it, Sam? 
Do me a favor? 
What do you want, now? 
Would you mind taking it, just one more time? 
From the top? 
No! From the ending! 
Wonderful! 
 
And while we are swinging, to mention a few 
We'll drop in at Danny's, The Little Club too 
But wind up at Jilly's, whatever we do 
Life is gonna be we wow whee! 
(Wow!) 
For my shadow and me! 
 
Frank? 
Oh, forget it Sam.

MEDITATION (MEDITACAO)

 In my loneliness, when you're gone and I'm all by myself and I need your caress 
I just think of you, and the thought of you holding me near 
Makes my loneliness soon disappear. 
Though you're far away, I have only to close my eyes and you are back to stay 
I just close my eyes and the sadness that missing you brings 
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings 
Yes I love you so, and that for me is all I need to know 
I will wait for you till the sun falls from out of the sky, for what else can I do 
I will wait for you, meditating how sweet life will be when you come back to me

MICHAEL AND PETER

 Michael is you, he has your face, he still has your eyes 
Remember, Peter is me, 'cept when he smiles 
And if you look at them both for a while 
You can see they are you, they are me 
This spring we had some heavy rain, my summer it was dry again 
The roses that we planted last fall climb the wall 
I think the house could use some paint, you know your mother's such a saint 
She takes the boys whenever she can, she sure needs a man 
All those years I've worked for Santa Fe, never ever missed a single day 
Just one more without a raise in pay, and I'm leavin' 
And the air still has a country smell, and everyone is looking well 
As far as anyone can tell, the sun will rise tomorrow 
You'll never believe how much they're growin' 
John Henry came to cut the lawn, again he asked me where you'd gone 
Can't tell you all the times he's been told, but he's so old 
Guess that's all the news I've got today, least that's all the news that I can say 
Maybe soon the words will come my way tomorrow 
And the air still has a country smell, and everyone is looking well 
As far as anyone can tell, the sun will rise tomorrow 
You'll never believe how much they're growin' 
You'll never believe how much they're growin'...

(chorus) [the drunks] The rest are solos. 
 
Booze, Mister Booze (Mister Booze), Mister Booze 
Mister B double O, Z Eeee, (that sure spells booze), 
You will wind up wearing tattered shoes if you mess with Mister Booze, 
(Don't mess with Mister Booze, don't mess with Mister Booze.) 
Don't mess with B, double o, Z, E, if you've been so simply occupied. 
You'll feel better once you testify, (testify, testify) 
[I want to testify, I want to testify] 
Well, then cleanse yourself, my child, cleanse yourself. 
Brothers and sisters, I happen to know this poor unfortunate soul, 
And the fight she is waging against sin, 
That old devil Booze has changed her 
Into the unsightly person you see before you. 
Give us your testimony, my child. 
[Well, it all began with Johnny] (Yeah?) 
[He said drink helped him stay alive] (Yeah?) 
[Do you know how old he was when he died?] (No) 
[He was twenty five] (No. no) 
[That's why I gotta come clean] (why?) 
[Because I'm already seventeen] 
Who's to blame? (Who's to blame?) What his name? 
(We know his name, his name is.) 
Mister Booze, Mister Booze, Mister B, double O, Z, E, 
Don't ever choose, any game you play with him, you lose, 
 
If your head feels like it's two miles wide, 
You'll feel better once you testify (testify, testify, testify) 
[I want to testify, I want to testify] 
Well, come forward, dear brother, come forward. 
You see here, ladies and gentlemen, a man who just last year 
Was the United States Olympic heavyweight wrestling champion, 
Here he is, just a shadow of his former self, wasted in health, ravaged by sin. 
Oh give us your testimony, dear brother. 
[I was cruel and I was mean] he was mean! 
[I was a no gooder, pickpocket] (a no good pickpocket) 
[And then you see, sin got me in its clutches now] sin got him in his clutches, 
[No. I said sin was not...] Oh, I didn't hear the first part 
[And that's why I need forgiving] (Why?) 
['Cause my hands shake so much now, I can't even make love] 
That's a shame, (what a shame) who's to blame? (Who's to blame?) 
(Mister Booze, Mister Booze, Mister B, double O, Z., E. what's with you?) 
(You'll make the office dupe a recluse, sister, if you dance with Mister Booze.) 
(If you prince with tiffless, naughty guy,) 
(You'll feel better when you testify, testify, oh yeah, testify, oh yeah, testify) 
[I wanna testify. I wanna testify.] 
Ah but you don't have to. [oh but I wanna] (oh let the bum testify!) 
Okay, then put down that demijohn and come up forward here, 
And let us lead you on the path of righteousness. Not long ago, brothers and sisters, 
This helpless soul was the foremost brain surgeon in this grand and glorious country. 
Success was smiling down upon him. 
Now go ahead and tell us your story. Don't be shy. 
[Let me tell. Let me tell. You see I use spirits for medicinal purposes only] (Yeah) 
[I manufacture it for medicinal purposes only.] (yeah?) 
[Then I started drinking what I manufactured till I drank myself] 
[Out of a hell of a business for medicinal purposes only.] (That's right) 
Now, alcohol makes a big man small and can lead to life of crime. 
Drinking rum makes you skin and bone, and you cash in before your time. 
Bootleg gin for your Mickey Finn till you don't even know your name. 
You're a basket case right on your face, there's only one guy to blame. 
(Oh Mister Booze, Mister Booze, Mister B, double O, Z, E, don't ever queue,) 
(Don't you wind up swearing platitudes if you're mad with Mister Booze) 
(Oh, Mister Booze, Don't mess, mess with Mr. Booze.) 
Don't mess with B, double O. Z, E, cause that spells booze. 
And you gotta lose with Mi ister Booze. (Oh Yeah). 
Don't mess around with Mister Booze. 
(Don't with Mister Booze, Don't with Mister Booze.) 
(What's his name now, Oh Mister Booze), 
(Don't mess with Mister Booze), Oh Mister Booze, (Don't mess with Mister Booze.)

MISTY

 Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree 
And I feel like I'm hanging from a cloud, I can't understand 
I get misty, just holding your hand, walk my way 
And a thousand violins begin to play 
Or it might be the sound of your hello 
This magic I hear, I get misty the moment you're near 
You could say that you're leading me on, but it's just what I want you to do 
Can't you see just how hopelessly I'm drawn, that's why I'm following you 
On my own, would I wander through this wonderland alone 
Never knowing my right foot from my left, my hat from my glove 
I get misty, and too much in love on my own 
Would I wander through this wonderland alone 
Never knowing my right foot from my left 
My hat and my glove, I get misty and too much in love 
Look at me

 

FRANK SINATRA
MOMENT TO MOMENT

 From moment to moment every moment that I live 
I live for every moment with you 
To see you, to touch you, to imagine this will be 
The moment when a dream comes true 
 
Just an ordinary day becomes adventure 
Such sweet adventure I never knew 
And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of 
The miracle that love can do 
From moment to moment with you 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of 
The miracle that love can do 
From moment to moment with you

MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK

 I know there were a hundred ways to tell her I loved her 
It's funny how they're all so clear today 
And when her face was burning with sadness and yearning 
I don't know why I turned my eyes away 
 
But it's so easy looking at the game the morning after 
Adding up the kisses and the laughter 
Knowing how you'd play it if the chance to play it over ever came 
But then, a Monday morning quarterback never lost a game 
 
The room was so alive with all her feelings and longings 
I saw the spark of danger in her eyes 
Well, how would it have hurt me if I'd turned back and held her? 
A moment passes, something lovely dies 
 
But it's so easy looking at the game the morning after 
Adding up the kisses and the laughter 
Knowing how you'd play it if the chance to play it over ever came 
But then, a Monday morning quarterback never lost a game 
 
[instrumental French horns first two lines of chorus] 
 
Yes, it's easier to win it when you know you'd never play it quite the same 
But then, this Monday morning quarterback never lost a game

 

FRANK SINATRA
MOODY RIVER

 [Chorus:] 
Moody river, more deadly than the vainest knife 
Moody river, your muddy water took my baby's life 
 
Last Saturday evenin' came to the old oak tree 
It stands beside the river where you were to meet me 
On the ground your glove I found with a note addressed to me 
It read Dear love, I've done you wrong, now I must set you free 
No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin. 
I just couldn't tell you that guy was just a friend 
 
[Chorus] 
 
I looked into the muddy water and what could I see? 
I saw a lonely, lonely face just lookin' back at me 
Tears in his eyes and a prayer on his lips 
And the glove of his lost love at his fingertips 
 
[Chorus]

 

FRANK SINATRA
MOON LOVE

 Will this be moon love, nothing but moon love, 
Will you be gone when the dawn comes stealing through? 
Are these just moon dreams, grand while the moon beams? 
But when the moon fades away, will my dreams come true? 
Much as I love you, don't let me love you. 
If I must pay for your kiss with lonely tears, say it's not moon love. 
Tell me it's true, say you'll be mine when the moon disappears.

 

FRANK SINATRA
MOON RIVER

 Moon river, wider than a mile 
I'm crossin' you in style some day 
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker 
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way 
 
Two drifters, off to see the world 
There's such a lot of world to see 
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend 
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me 
 
[instrumental first verse] 
 
Two drifters, off to see the world 
There's such a lot of world to see 
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend 
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me

 

FRANK SINATRA
MOON SONG

 Once I tried to capture the rapture of the night, 
Silly dreams I knew would disappear, 
But it seems they left a souvenir, 
One refrain eternally will haunt me, taunt me. 
It came from nowhere the night that we met, 
T'was like a melodious plea, wee moon song that wasn't meant for me. 
Why is it always reminding me of a love dream that never could be. 
Wee moon song that wasn't meant for me. 
It came gliding into my heart, riding on a moonbeam from above. 
Sorrow and this and the whole world blended in a rhapsody of love. 
There I heard her singing to somebody else, 
What I thought was my melody, 
Wee moon song that wasn't meant for me.

 

FRANK SINATRA
MOONLIGHT BECOMES YOU

 You're all dressed up to go dreaming, now don't tell me I'm wrong 
And what a night to go dreaming, mind if I tag along 
Moonlight becomes it goes with your hair 
You certainly know the right thing to wear 
Moonlight becomes you I'm thrilled at the sight 
And I could get so romantic tonight 
You're all dressed up to go dreaming, now don't you tell me I'm wrong 
What a night to go dreaming, mind if I tag along 
And if I say: I love you I want you to know 
It's not just because there's moonlight although 
Moonlight becomes you so

 

FRANK SINATRA
MOONLIGHT MOOD

 Moonlight mood when twilight is ending 
You're in my moonlight mood and our hearts are blending 
There on the same old wall that we used to know long ago 
You walked there in a ribbon of moonlight 
There you are as lovely as ever 
You vowed by every star to love me forever 
Although you're far away we meet in my solitude 
You are mine when I'm in my moonlight mood... 
Then in the moonlight you are mine 
When I'm in my moonlight mood...

 

FRANK SINATRA
MOONLIGHT ON THE GANGES

 Moonlight on the Ganges, my little Hindu, 
When I whisper love's sweet melody, 
All our dreams and our schemes came true. 
Someday on the Ganges, I'll need you once more, 
And I'll kiss you and caress you 
Where the waters kiss the silent shore. 
(musical interlude) 
Moonlight on the Ganges, my little Hindu, 
When I whispeedr love's sweet melody, 
All our dreams and our schemes came true. 
Someday on the Ganges, I'll need you once more, 
And I'll kiss you and caress you 
Where the waters kiss, kiss the silent shore.

 

FRANK SINATRA
MOONLIGHT SERENADE

 I stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight 
I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night 
The roses are sighing a Moonlight Serenade. 
 
The stars are aglow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming. 
My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming? 
I bring you and I sing you a Moonlight Serenade 
 
Let us stray till break of day in love's valley of dreams. 
Just you and I, a summer sky, a heavenly breeze kissin' the trees. 
 
So don't let me wait, come to me tenderly in the June night. 
I stand at your gate and I sing you a song in the moonlight 
A love song, my darling, a Moonlight Serenade.

 

FRANK SINATRA
MORE (THEME FROM MONDO CANE)

 More than the greatest love the world has known, 
This is the love I give to you alone, 
More than the simple words I try to say, 
I only live to love you more each day. 
More than you'll ever know, my arms long to hold you so, 
My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping, 
Longer than always is a long long time, but far beyond forever you're gonna be mine. 
I know I've never lived before and my heart is very sure, 
No one else could love you more. 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
More than you'll ever know , my arms they long to hold you so, 
My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping, 
Longer than always is a long long time, but far beyond forever you'll be mine, 
I know that I've never lived before and my heart is very sure, 
No one else could love you more, no one else could love you more.

MORE THAN YOU KNOW

 [Intro] 
Whether you are here or yonder, whether you are false or true 
Whether you remain or wander, I'm growing fonder of you 
Even though your friends forsake you, even though you don't succeed 
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, give you the break you need 
 
More than you know, more than you know 
Girl of my heart, I love you so 
Lately I find you're on my mind 
More than you know 
 
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong 
Girl of my heart, I'll string along 
You need me so 
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know) 
 
Loving you the way that I do 
There's nothing I can do about it 
Loving may be all you can give 
But baby I can't live without it 
 
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry 
If you got tired and said Good bye 
More than I'd show 
More than you'd ever know

MRS. ROBINSON

 And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson, 
Jilly loves you more than you will know, whoa, whoa, whoa 
Oh bless you please, Mrs. Robinson, heaven holds a place for those who pray 
Hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey; hey, hey, hey) 
 
We'd like to know a little bit about you for our file 
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself 
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes 
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home 
 
The PTA, Mrs. Robinson, won't OK the way you do your thing, ding, ding, ding 
And you'll get yours, Mrs. Robinson, foolin' with that young stuff like you do 
Boo, hoo, hoo; woo, woo, woo 
So how's your bird, Mrs. Robinson, Dandy , Mrs. Robinson you'd say 
Hey, hey, hey 
Well have you heard, Mrs. Robinson, mine is fine as wine, and I should know 
Ho, ho, ho

MY BABY JUST CARES FOR ME

 My baby don't care for shows, my baby don't care for clothes, 
My baby just cares for me. 
My baby don't care for furs and laces, 
My baby don't care for high toned places. 
My baby don't care for rings, or other expensive things. 
She's sensible as can be. 
My baby don't care who knows it, my baby just cares for me

 

FRANK SINATRA
MY FOOLISH HEART

 The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart! 
How white the ever constant moon, take care, my foolish heart! 
There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this, 
For they give the very same sensation. 
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss. 
Your lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart! 
But should our eager lips combine, then let the fire start. 
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart!

MY HEART STOOD STILL

 [Version 1] 
 
[Frank and chorus] (chorus only) 
 
[Frank speaks] 
When most us saddle up for the old trail for our last ride, we leave little 
enough behind to show that once we have camped here. Some leave more than 
others, some a memory and some a fortune, some a song. And a song can be as 
fine a memorial to a man as anything that can be left behind, 'cause you see 
it's gold, and it's gold that all can share. We have a great song to 
remember Lorenz Hart by, that wonderful melody that he and Dick Rodgers 
wrote for the Connecticut Yankee, of course you know, My Heart Stood Still 
[sings] 
I took one look at you, that's all I meant to do 
And then my heart stood still, 
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk 
And yet my heart stood still. 
Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew 
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew 
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment 
When my heart stood still. 
(That unfelt clasp of hands told me how well you knew, hmmmm) 
I laughed at sweethearts I met at schools 
All indiscreet hearts seemed romantic fools 
(A house in Iceland was my heart's domain) 
(I saw your eyes, now castles rise in Spain!) 
[a brief interlude through the first verse] 
Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew 
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well that you knew 
I never lived at all [until the thrill of that moment] 
[When my heart stood still.] 
 
 
[Version 2] 
 
I took one look at you, 
That's all I meant to do 
And then my heart stood still 
My feet could step and walk 
My lips could move and talk 
And yet my heart stood still 
 
Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew 
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew 
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when 
My heart stood still 
 
Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew 
That unfelt clasp of hands told me very well you knew 
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when 
My heart stood still

MY KIND OF GIRL

 She walks like an angel walks, she talks like an angel talks, 
And her hair has a kind of curl, to my mind, she's my kind of girl. 
She's wise like an angel's wise, with eyes like an angel's eyes, 
And a smile like a kind of pearl, to my mind, she's my kind of girl. 
A pretty little face, that face just knocks me off my feet, 
A pretty little feet, she's really sweet enough to eat. 
She looks like an angel looks, she cooks like an angel cooks, 
And my mind in a kind of whirl, to my mind, she's my kind of girl. 
 
[full instrumental interlude] 
 
Hmmm, pretty little face, that face just knocks me off my feet, 
Pretty little feet, she's really sweet enough to eat. 
She looks like an angel looks, and she cooks like an angel cooks, 
And my mind in a kind of whirl, to my mind, she's my kind of girl. 
Yes, my poor heart's in a whirl, she's just my kind, she's a girl. 
And I'm glad.

MY KIND OF TOWN

 Now this could only happen to a guy like me 
And only happen in a town like this 
So may I say to each of you most gratef'lly 
As I throw each one of you a kiss 
 
This is my kind of town, Chicago is 
My kind of town, Chicago is 
My kind of people, too 
People who smile at you 
 
And each time I roam, Chicago is 
Calling me home, Chicago is 
Why I just grin like a clown 
It's my kind of town 
 
[brief instrumental] 
 
My kind of town, Chicago is 
My kind of town, Chicago is 
My kind of razzmatazz 
And it has all that jazz 
 
And each time I leave, Chicago is 
Tuggin' my sleeve, Chicago is 
The Wrigley Building, Chicago is 
The Union Stockyard, Chicago is 
One town that won't let you down 
It's my kind of town

MY SHINING HOUR

 This moment, this minute 
And each second in it 
Will leave a glow upon the sky 
And as time goes by, it will never die 
 
This will be my shining hour 
Calm and happy and bright 
And in my dreams, your face will flower 
Through the darkness of the night 
 
Like the lights of home before me 
Or an angel, who's watching o'er me 
This will be my shining hour 
'til I'm with you again

MY SWEET LADY

 Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me 
Did you think our time together was all gone 
Lady, you've been dreaming, I'm as close as I can be 
And I swear to you our time has just begun 
 
Close your eyes and rest your weary mind 
I promise I will stay right here beside you 
Today our lives were joined, became entwined 
I wish that you could know how much I love you 
 
Lady, are you happy, do you feel the way I do 
Are there meanings that you've never seen before 
Lady, my sweet lady, I just can't believe it's true 
And it's like I've never, ever loved before 
 
Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me 
Did you think our time together was all gone 
Lady, my sweet lady, I'm as close as I can be 
And I swear to you our time has just begun

 

FRANK SINATRA
MY WAY

 And now, the end is here 
And so I face the final curtain 
My friend, I'll say it clear 
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain 
I've lived a life that's full 
I traveled each and ev'ry highway 
And more, much more than this, I did it my way 
 
Regrets, I've had a few 
But then again, too few to mention 
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption 
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway 
And more, much more than this, I did it my way 
 
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew 
When I bit off more than I could chew 
But through it all, when there was doubt 
I ate it up and spit it out 
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way 
 
I've loved, I've laughed and cried 
I've had my fill, my share of losing 
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing 
To think I did all that 
And may I say, not in a shy way, 
 Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way 
 
For what is a man, what has he got? 
If not himself, then he has naught 
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels 
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way! 
 
[instrumental] 
 
Yes, it was my way

 

FRANK SINATRA
MY WAY OF LIFE

 Gotta have you near all the time, with your dreams wrapped up in mine. 
Gotta be a part of your soul and your heart all the time. 
Nothing in the world that I do means a thing without you. 
I'm just half alive in my struggle to survive without you. 
You are my way of life, the only way I know, you are my way of life. 
I'll never let you go, never let you out of my sight, be it day, be it night, 
You belong to me, that's the way it will, be wrong or right, 
I don't need crowds at my door, the applause from the floor, 
All I need is you and the love we once knew, nothing more. 
You are my way of life, the only way I know, make me your way of life.

 

FRANK SINATRA
NAME IT AND IT'S YOURS

 How would you like Aladdin's Lamp to call your own? 
The wells that once was Singapore, fast Italian cars, 
Diamonds big as stars, just name it and it's yours. 
How would you like the finest laces from Cologne, 
And pearls that come from coral shores, 
And to match your eyes, blue Venetian skies, 
Just name it and it's yours. 
I know all this may sound extreme, and quite impossible to do. 
But when we kiss, the wildest dreams could very possibly come true. 
Until you have Aladdin's Lamp to call your own, 
Let's window shop the local stores, 
And for just a start, if you want a heart, 
I have one that worships and adores, 
Just name it, and it's yours. 
(musical interlude) 
Until we have a dozen oil wells in the yard, 
Let's window shop the local stores, 
And for just a start, if you want a heart, 
I have one that worships and adores, 
Just name it, and it's yours.

 

FRANK SINATRA
NANCY

 If I don't see her each day, I miss her 
Gee what a thrill, each time I kiss her 
Believe me, I've got a case 
On nancy, with the laughing face 
 
She takes the winter and makes it summer 
And summer could take some lessons from her 
Picture a tomboy in lace 
That's nancy with the laughing face 
 
Have you ever heard mission bells ringing 
Well she'll give you the very same glow 
When she speaks you would think it was singing 
Just hear her say hello 
 
I swear to goodness, you can't resist her 
She's mighty sweet, and wait till you see her sister 
No angel could replace 
Nancy, with the laughing face

NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT

 Holdin' hands at midnight 
'neath a starry sky 
Nice work if you can get it 
And you can get it if you try 
 
Strollin' with the one girl 
Sighin' sigh after sigh 
Nice work if you can get it 
And you can get it if you try 
 
Just imagine someone 
Waiting at the cottage door 
Where two hearts become one 
Who could ask for anything more? 
 
Loving one who loves you 
And then takin' that vow 
Nice work if you can get it 
And if you get it won't you tell me how? 
 
[very brief instrumental] 
 
Holdin' hands at midnight 
'neath a starry sky 
[last two lines are instrumental] 
 
And strollin' with the one girl 
Sighing sigh after sigh 
[last two lines are instrumental] 
 
Just imagine someone 
Waiting at the cottage door 
Where two hearts become one 
Who could ask for anything more? 
 
Loving one who loves you 
And then takin' that vow 
Nice work if you can get it 
And if you get it won't you tell me how?

NIGHT

 I can just about get through the day, 
But the night makes me nervous 
Not for any reason. 
Except maybe that it catches you unaware, 
And follows you the way a woman follows 
When she wants something.. 
 
[music interlude] 
 
I've been in every kind of night, 
Why, I shouldn't be afraid of darkness, 
But for some reason, the night makes me nervous.

FRANK SINATRA
NIGHT AND DAY

 Night and day, you are the one 
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun 
Whether near to me or far 
It's no matter, darling, where you are 
I think of you day and night 
 
Night and day, why is it so 
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go ? 
In the roarin' traffic's boom 
In the silence of my lonely room 
I think of you day and night 
 
Night and day, under the hide of me 
There's an oh, such a hungry yearnin' burnin' inside of me 
And its torment won't be through 
Till you let me spend my life makin' love to you 
Day and night, night and day 
 
[Instrumental] 
 
Night and day, you are the one 
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun 
Whether near to me or far 
It's no matter, baby, where you are 
I think of you day and night 
 
Night and day, why is it so 
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go ? 
In the roarin' traffic's boom 
Silence of my lonely room 
I think of you day and night 
 
Night and day, under the hide of me 
There's an oh, such a hungry burning inside of me 
And its torment won't be through 
Till you let me spend life makin' love to you 
Day and night, night and day

NIGHT AND DAY

 Night and day, you are the one 
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun 
Whether near to me or far 
It's no matter, darling, where you are 
I think of you day and night 
 
Night and day, why is it so 
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go ? 
In the roarin' traffic's boom 
In the silence of my lonely room 
I think of you day and night 
 
Night and day, under the hide of me 
There's an oh, such a hungry yearnin' burnin' inside of me 
And its torment won't be through 
Till you let me spend my life makin' love to you 
Day and night, night and day

NOAH

 The world's a tiny blue green ark 
Afloat in darkest space. 
And every creature lives his time 
And knows his special place 
And each of us is Noah 
With a life all in our care 
To keep against the darkness 
That's flooding everywhere 
 
We've got to walk with the lion, 
Soar with the eagle, 
Sing with the nightingale 
And live in love and peace. 
 
The times have made us fearful 
And our fears have brought the tears 
The loneliness and darkness 
Have grown bitter with the years 
But a light is just beyond us 
and the children almost see 
A world that we've forgotten 
And the world they want to be 
 
When we walk with the lion, 
Soar with the eagle, 
Sing with the nightingale 
And live in love and peace. 
 
The ark is getting crowded now 
And each of us must know 
When everything is finished here 
There's no where else to go. 
The beasts are here to bless us 
And the faith is in their eyes 
That we can find the garden 
And see that sweet dawn rise 
 
And we can walk with the lion, 
Soar with the eagle, 
Sing with the nightingale 
and live in love and peace. 
 
We've got to walk with the lion, 
Soar with the eagle, 
Sing with the nightingale 
And live in love and peace.

NOBODY WINS

 Anymore it doesn't matter who's right or wrong. 
We've been injurin' each other much too long. 
And it's too late to try to save what might have been. 
It's over; nobody wins. 
 
Make believin' in forever is just a lie. 
And it seems a little sadder each time we try. 
'Cause it's a shame to make the same mistake again and again. 
It's over; nobody wins. 
 
We've gone too far, too long, too far apart. 
The lovin' was easy; it's the livin' that's hard. 
For there's no need to stay to see the way it ends. 
It's over; nobody wins. 
 
We've gone too far, too long, too far apart.

It's over; nobody wins.

NOTHING BUT THE BEST

 I like a new Lincoln with all of its class, 
I like a martini, and third on the glass, 
I'm gonna start living, you wait and see, 
Nothing but the best is good enough for me. 
I like to eat lobster directly from Maine, 
I like to see bullfights in sunny old Spain, 
I'm gonna start living, you wait and see, 
Nothing but the best is good enough for me. 
Talley ho, off we go, who can wait another day, 
You and me, out on a spree, let's get started right away. 
We're gonna go charlin', and have us a fling, 
We'll visit a palace, and dine with the king, 
We're gonna start living, you wait and see, 
Nothing but the best is good enough for me.

NOW IS THE HOUR

 Now is the hour when we must say goodbye. 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea. 
While you're away, oh, then, remember me. 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here. 
Sunset glow fades in the west. Night o'er the valley is creeping. 
Birds cuddle down in their nest, soon all the world will be sleeping. 
Now is the hour when we must goodbye. 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea. 
While you're away, oh, then, remember me. 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here.

OH! WHAT IT SEEMED TO BE

 It was just a neighborhood dance 
That's all that it was 
But, oh, what it seemed to be 
It was like a masquerade ball 
With costumes and all 
'Cause you were at the dance with me 
It was just a ride on a train 
That's all that it was 
But, oh, what it seemed to be 
It was like a trip to the stars 
To Venus and Mars 
'Cause you were on the train with me 
And when I kissed you, darling 
It was more than just a thrill for me 
It was the promise, darling 
Of the things that fate had willed for me 
It was just a wedding in June 
That's all that it was 
But, oh, what it seemed to be 
It was like a royal affair 
With everyone there 
'Cause you said Yes, I do to me

OH, HOW I MISS YOU TONIGHT

 Oh, how I miss you tonight, miss you while lights are low, 
Oh, how I need you tonight, more than you'll ever know. 
Each moment, though we're apart, you're never out of my heart. 
But I'd rather be lonely, and wait for you only, 
My dear, how I miss you tonight.

OH, YOU CRAZY MOON

 When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through 
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do? 
And when they kissed, they tried to say that it was just in fun 
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done 
 
Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end 
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend 
 
There they are, they fell in love, I guess you think that you're smart 
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

OL' MAN RIVER

 [Elongated Intro] 
Here we all work 'long the Mississippi 
Here we all work while the white folk play 
Pullin' them boats from the dawn till sunset 
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day 
 
Don't look up and don't look down 
Ya don't dast make the white boss frown 
Bend your knees and bow your head 
And pull that rope until you're dead 
 
Let me go 'way from the Mississippi 
Let me go 'way from the white man boss 
Show me that stream called the River Jordan 
That's the old stream that I long to cross 
[End Of Intro] 
 
Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River 
He must know somepin', but he don't say nothin' 
 
He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' along 
 
He don't plant taters, and he don't plant cotton 
And them what plants 'em is soon forgotten 
But Ol' Man River, jest keeps rollin' along 
 
You and me, we sweat and strain 
Bodies all achin' and wracked with pain 
Tote that barge and lift that bale 
Ya get a little drunk and ya lands in ja ail 
 
I gets weary and so sick of tryin' 
I'm tired of livin', but I'm feared of dyin' 
And Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along

OLD DEVIL MOON

 I look at you and suddenly, something in your eyes I see; 
Soon begins bewitching me. 
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies. 
It's that old devil moon in your eyes. 
You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle. 
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle; 
To your razzle dazzle. 
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride; 
Full of butterflies inside. 
Wanna cry, wanna croon, wanna laugh like a loon. 
It's that old devil moon in your eyes. 
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove. 
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love

 

FRANK SINATRA
ON A CLEAR DAY (YOU CAN SEE FOREVER)

 On a clear day, rise and look around you, and you'll see who you are. 
On a clear day, how it will astound you 
That the glow of your feelings outshines every star. 
You will follow every mountain, sea and shore, 
You will see from far and near a world you've never seen before. 
On a clear day, on a clear day, you can see forever, and ever, and ever more.

 

FRANK SINATRA
ONCE I LOVED (O AMOR EN PAZ)

 Once, once I loved 
And I gave so much love to this love you were the world to me 
Once I cried 
At the thought I was foolish and proud and let you say goodbye 
 
And then one day 
From my infinite sadness you came and brought me love again 
Now I know 
That no matter what ever befalls I'll never let you go 
I will hold you close, make you stay 
Because love is the saddest thing when it goes away 
Love is the saddest thing when it goes away

 

FRANK SINATRA
ONCE UPON A TIME

 Once upon a time a girl with moonlight in her eyes 
Put her hand in mine and said she loved me so 
But that was once upon a time very long ago 
 
Once upon a hill we sat beneath a willow tree 
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn 
But that was once upon a time, now the tree is gone 
 
How the breeze ruffled through her hair 
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there 
We were young and didn't have a care 
Where did it go? 
 
Once upon a time the world was sweeter than we knew 
Everything was ours, how happy we were then 
But somehow once upon a time never comes again 
 
[brief string interlude] 
 
Once upon a time never comes again

ONE NOTE SAMBA (SAMBA DE UMA NOTA SO)

 This is just a little samba, built upon a single note 
Other notes are sure to follow but the root is still that note 
Now this new note is the consequence of the one we've just been through 
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you 
There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk 
And just say nothing or nearly nothing 
I have used up all the scale I know and at the end I've come 
To nothing I mean nothing 
So I come back to my first note as I must come back to you 
I will pour into that one note all the love I feel for you 
Any one who wants the whole show show do re mi fa so la ci do 
He will find himself with no show better play the note you know

 

FRANK SINATRA
ONLY ONE TO A CUSTOMER

 Only one to a customer, only one, 
One crack at paradise, next to none, 
Here am I riding high on a miracle come full blown, 
Hold him tight through a night like I've never known. 
Because there's only one kind of wonderful, 
I still try it, you and that smile I see in your eyes, 
You'll never know the feeling until you spent your life in line, 
Only one to your customer, and this time, I got mine. 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
Only one to a customer, rarely two, 
But when you got that dream, one will do, 
Why despair at the fair possibility luck has flown, 
Stick around, fend your ground, till the cards are shown. 
Because there's only one way they won't come up all aces high, 
That's it, you've let the deal pass you by, 
Somebody up there bottle the thrill, and like the rarest wine, 
If it's one to a customer, I say, just fine, 
Only one to a customer, and this one, this little bird is mine

OUT BEYOND THE WINDOW

 My window looks out over the park, 
And every year I move another story up. 
So now I'm almost close enough 
To the roof of the sky to touch it. 
I could even move the clouds aside, 
But no clouds come, if they did, I'd welcome them. 
'Cause I have very few visitors here any more. 
There must be a highway somewhere, roads I've missed, 
Something more than sky out beyond the window.

PASS ME BY

 (Pass me by, pass me by, if you don't happen to like it, pass me by) 
I got me ten fine toes to wiggle in the sand, 
Lots of idle fingers snap to my command, 
A loverly pair of heels that kick to beat the band, 
Contemplating nature can be fascinating, 
Add to these a nose that I can thumb, and a mouth by gum have I 
So tell the whole wide world, if you don't happen to like it, 
Deal me out, thank you kindly, pass me by.

Behold me two great shoes that never saw a shine, 
Houses I could hold up with a laundry line. 
A loverly patch that hide an awful lot of spine. 
Shirtails flying, I'm a blooming dandelion. 
Add to these, a grin from ear to ear, all the proper gear have I, 
So tell the whole wide world, if you don't like the thought of it, 
Bail me out, thank you kindly, pass me by.

PENNIES FROM HEAVEN

 Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven 
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven? 
You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town 
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down 
 
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers 
If you want the things you love, you must have showers 
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree 
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me 
 
[lengthy instrumental sax solo and then brass] 
 
Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven 
Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven 
You'll find your fortune's fallin', baby, all over the town 
Be sure, be sure that your umbrella is upside down 
 
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers 
If you want the things you love, you've got to have showers 
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree 
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

PICK YOURSELF UP

 Now nothing's impossible, I've found for when my chin is on the ground, 
I pick myself up, dust myself off, and start all over again. 
Don't lose your confidence if you slip, be grateful for a pleasant trip, 
And pick yourself up, dust off, start over again. 
Work like a soul inspired until the battle of the day is won. 
You may be sick and tired, but you be a man, my son. 
Will you remember the famous men who have to fall to rise again, 
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, start all over again. 
[musical interlude] 
You gotta work like a soul inspired until the battle of the day is won. 
You may be sick and tired, but you be a man, my son. 
Will you remember the famous men who have to fall and then to rise again, 
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again. 
[musical interlude] 
Once again now: 
Will you remember the famous men who have to fall and then rise again, 
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again.

PLEASE BE KIND

 Well, this is my first affair, please be kind 
Handle my heart with care, please be kind 
This is all so grand, my dreams are on parade 
If you'll just understand, they'll never, never fade 
 
So tell me your love's sincere, please be kind 
Tell me I needn't fear, please be kind 
'cause if you leave me, dear, I know my heart will lose its mind 
If you love me, please be kind 
 
This is my first affair, so [trumpet blast] a please be kind 
Handle my heart with care, oh [two trumpet blasts] a please be kind

PLEASE DON'T TALK ABOUT ME WHEN I'M GONE

 Please don't talk about me when I'm gone, 
Oh, honey though our friendship ceases, from now on; 
And, listen, if you can't say anything real nice, 
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice. 
 
We're parting, you go your way I'll go mine, 
It's best that we do; 
Here's a kiss! I hope that this brings lots of luck to you. 
 
Makes no difference how I carry on, 
Remember, please don't talk about me when I'm gone.

POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES

 Pee rac ti cal I ty de us n't int'rest me, love the life that I lead. 
I've got a pocketful of miracles, and with a pocketful of miracles, 
One miracle a day is all I need! 
Tree rou bles, more or less, bee ah ther me, I guess when the sun doesn't shine. 
But there's a pocketful of miracles, 
The world's a bright and shiny apple that's mine, all mine. 
I hear sleigh bells ringing, smack! I go around like there's a snow around, 
I feel so good, it's Christmas every day! Lee ife's a carousel, fee ar as I can tell 
And I'm riding for free. 
I've got a pocketful of miracles, but if I had to pick a miracle, 
My favorite miracle of all is you love me.

POLKA DOTS AND MOONBEAMS

 [instrumental intro 1:43] 
 
A country dance was being held in a garden 
I felt a bump and heard an Oh, beg your pardon 
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams 
All around a pug nosed dream 
 
The music started and was I the perplexed one 
I held my breath and said May I have the next one? 
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams 
Sparkled on a pug nosed dream 
 
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers 
As we floated over the floor 
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers 
And perhaps a few things more 
 
Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter 
I know the meaning of the words Ever after 
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams 
When I kiss the pug nosed dream

 

FRANK SINATRA
POOR BUTTERFLY

 Poor Butterfly, 'neath the blossoms waiting 
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so 
The moments pass into hours 
The hours pass into years, and as she smiles through her tears 
She murmurs low, the moon and I know that he'll be faithful 
I'm sure he'll come back by and by 
But if he don't come back, I just must die, poor Butterfly 
 
[Repeat, then modulate and repeat again]

PRETTY COLORS

 I close my eyes and just see pretty colors, 
They're dancing just for me, pretty colors (pretty colors) 
Locked in my mind they'll always be, 
You'll never give your love to me, 
So I'll just close my eyes and just see pretty colors (pretty colors). 
Locked in my mind they'll always be, 
You'll never give your love to me, 
So I'll just close my eyes and just see pretty colors (pretty colors) 
Pretty colors (pretty colors), pretty colors

PRISONER OF LOVE

 Alone from night to night you'll find me too weak to break the chains that bind me. 
I need no shackles to remind me, I'm just a prisoner of love. 
For one command, I stand and wait now from one who's master of my fate now. 
I can't escape for it's too late now, I'm just a prisoner of love. 
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing those arms with me. 
Although she has another, I can't find another for I'm not free. 
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping, upon my knees to her I'm creeping, 
My very life is in her keeping, I'm just a prisoner of love

 

FRANK SINATRA
PUT YOUR DREAMS AWAY

 Put your dreams away for another day 
And I will take their place in your heart 
Wishing on a star never got you far 
And so it's time to make a new start 
 
When your dreams at night 
Fade before you 
Then I'll have the right 
To adore you 
 
Let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling 
And put all your dreams away 
 
[Musical Interlude] 
 
When your dreams at night

QUIET NIGHTS OF QUIET STARS (CORCOVADO)

 Quiet nights of quiet stars quiet chords from my guitar 
Floating on the silence that surrounds us. 
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams quiet walks by quiet streams 
And a window looking on the mountains and the sea, how lovely 
This is where I want to be here with you so close to me 
Until the final flicker of life's ember. 
I who was lost and lonely believing love was only 
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you, the meaning of existence, oh my love.

 

FRANK SINATRA
RAIN IN MY HEART

 My eyes are dry, my love, since you've been gone, I haven't shed a tear, 
I'll never cry, my love, though every day seems like a hundred years, 
For I'm just a fool who clings to his pride but when I'm alone, 
I can hear the sound of rain in my heart, of the tears that I hide, 
And it tears me apart, 'cause I keep them inside, 
I can't get away from the sound of the rain in my heart. 
How could I know, my love, I was a toy, only a game to you? 
How could you go, my love, without a thought of what I'm going through? 
How can I forget I still love you so, it echoes each time that I hear 
The sound of rain in my heart from the tears that I hide, 
So it tears me apart, I still keep them inside, 
But I can't escape from the sound of the rain in my heart. 
I hear that rain in my heart of the tears that I hide 
And it tears me apart, 'cause I keep them inside...

REACHING FOR THE MOON

 The moon and you appear to be so near and yet so far from me, 
And here am I, on a night in June, reaching for the moon and you. 
I wonder if we'll ever meet, my song of love is incomplete, 
I'm just the words, looking for the tune, reaching for the moon and you.

REMEMBER

 One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret 
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget 
One little heartache left as a token 
One little plaything carelessly broken 
 
Remember the night 
The night you said, I love you 
Remember? 
 
Remember you vowed 
By all the stars above you 
Remember? 
 
Remember we found a lonely spot 
And after I learned to care a lot 
 
You promised that you'd forget me not 
But you forgot 
To remember 
 
 
[2] 
Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day 
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was 
May 
But soon the Maytime turned to December 
You had forgotten, do you remember?

 

FRANK SINATRA
RING A DING DING

 Life is dull, it's nothing but one big lull, then presto you do a skull 
And find that you're reeling, she sighs and you're feeling like a toy on a string 
And your heart goes: Ring a ding ding, ring a ding ding, ring a ding ding 
How could that funny face that seemed to be common place 
Project you right in to space. without any warning 
Don't know if its morning, night time, winter or spring 
What's the difference: Ring a ding ding, ring a ding ding, ring a ding ding 
She takes (grabs) your hand this captivating creature 
And like its planned you're in the phone book looking (hunting) for the nearest preacher 
Life is swell, you're off to that small hotel, and somewhere a village bell 
Will sound in the steeple, announcing to people, Love's the loveliest thing 
And the bell goes: Ring a ding ding, ring a ding ding, ring a ding ding

ROSES OF PICARDY

 13, 1962, Los Angeles] 
 
She is watching by the poplars, 
Colinette with the sea blue eyes, 
She is watching and longing, and waiting 
Where the long white roadway lies, 
And a song stirs in the silence, 
As the wind in the boughs above, 
She listens and starts and trembles, 
'Tis the first little song of love. 
 
Roses are shining in Picardy, 
In the hush of the silver dew, 
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy, 
But there's never a rose like you! 
And the roses will die with the summertime, 
And our roads may be far apart, 
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy, 
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart 
 
And the years fly on forever, 
Till the shadows veil their skies, 
But he loves to hold her little hands, 
And look into her sea blue eyes, 
And she sees the road by the poplars, 
Where they met in the bygone years, 
For the first little song of the roses, 
Is the last little song she hears: 
 
Roses are shining in Picardy, 
In the hush of the silver dew, 
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy, 
But there's never a rose like you! 
And the roses will die with the summertime, 
And our roads may be far apart, 
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy, 
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart

SAND AND SEA

 Sand and sea, sea and sand 
And the warm bright sun up there above 
Summer days, happy days 
With my love 
 
Sand and sea, sea and sand 
Hear the wings in flight of the lovely dove 
Summer nights, happy nights 
We were makin' love 
 
The blinking stars are dancing on the whitecaps 
Crazy stars, they've had too many nightcaps 
I touch your hand, the hand that lies beside me 
Paradise can't be far if you'll guide me 
 
Sand and sea, sea and sand 
And the angels sing from above 
Happy days, hey, happy nights 
Makin' love 
 
Sand and sea, sea and sand 
And the angels sing from above 
Happy days, happy nights 
Makin' love 
 
We're in love 
Oooh oooh makin' love

Sand and sea

SATISFY ME ONE MORE TIME

 Don't deny me, satisfy me one more time, 
Barricade me and invade me, just one more time. 
Sacrifice me, don't be nice, be wild and free. 
Make a sex pot symbol out of little old me, 
Caress me, molest me, one more time, 
Excuse me and abuse me one more time. 
Excite me and ignite me with your sweet torso. 
Use your muscles, my corpuscles, wanna go. 
Assault me, attack me, lose control. 
Let's smother each other in a good old strangle hold. 
There's nothing but loving on my mind. 
Don't deny me, satisfy me one more time. 
Compromise me, vandalize me, have a ball, 
Destroy me and restore me through it all. 
Demolish, disassemble and dismantle all my doubts, 
It's confusing, I don't know my whereabouts. 
Bite my ears, baby, nibble on my nose 
Let your dimples put those pimples on my toes. 
There's sugar oozing over from my elbows to my knees, 
So cover me with kisses, get yourself some calories, 
If you don't want me climbing up the wall, 
Don't fool around my fertile ground at all. 
While the cold is getting colder, just be sure, 
Everything's up in my body's temperature, jack it up. 
They're still a lot of groovy good things on the shelf, 
When you reach the cookie jar, just help yourself, 
Saying nothing, but the loving on my mind. 
Don't deny me, satisfy me one more time. 
Encore, encore, encore.

SAY HELLO

 Just say hello to a brand new world, the world outside your door, 
Say hello to a singing bird, like no bird you heard before, 
It's all there, go and grab your share, life is a great big show, 
So go and introduce yourself, say hello, say hello. 
Say howdy do to a brand new man who's just begun to live. 
Howdy do to a brand new man with lots of love to give. 
Shake my hand, watch my chest expand, 
You, you wanna see me close and simply introduce yourself, 
Say hello, say hello. 
Let me repeat, from a front row seat, your eyes can see it all, 
Yea I repeat, there's lots of hight to beat, and as a slice a very small, 
Life, I mean, can be seen seeking you, you are in charge, you know, 
So introduce yourself to life, say hello, just just say hello.

SEARCHING

 All our days, we searched for just one love, wait for that one kiss, 
In a word, we spend our life just waiting to give our hearts away, 
Searching all our lives for that special day, 
And then one day you come upon a smile, unlike, unlike any smile. 
In a word, the searching is done, you come upon the only one, 
She stands there looking at you, simply says, how do you do, 
And all the searching is through. 
 
[musical interlude]

SECRET LOVE

 Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me, 
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free. 
So I asked a friendly star the way that lovers often do 
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you. 
Now I shout it from the highest hill, even told the golden daffodils, 
And now my heart's an open door, and my secret love's no secret any more.

SEND IN THE CLOWNS

 [Spoken intro] 
This is a song about a couple of adult people who have spent, oh, quite a long time 
together, till one day 
one of 'em gets restless and decides to leave. Whether it's the man or woman who left is unimportant. 
It's a breakup. 
It's a lovely marriage of words and music, written by Stephen Sondheim. 
 
 
Isn't it rich? Are we a pair? 
Me here at last on the ground and you in mid air 
Send in the clowns 
 
Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve? 
One who keeps tearing around and one who can't move 
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns 
 
Just when I stopped opening doors 
Finally finding the one that I wanted was yours 
Making my entrance again with my usual flair 
 
Sure of my lines 
Nobody's there 
 
Don't you love a farce? My fault, I fear 
I thought that you'd want what I want, sorry my dear 
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns 
Don't bother they're here 
 
Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer? 
Losing my timing this late in my career 
But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns 
Well, maybe next year

SEPTEMBER SONG

 [Lengthy Intro:] 
When I was a young man courting the girls 
I played me a waiting game 
If a maid refused me with tossing curls 
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls 
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls 
And as time came around she came my way 
As time came around, she came 
 
When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring 
You court them in song and rhyme 
They answer with words and a clover ring 
But if you could examine the goods they bring 
They have little to offer but the songs they sing 
And the plentiful waste of time of day 
A plentiful waste of time 
 
 
Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December 
But the days grow short when you reach September 
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame 
One hasn't got time for the waiting game 
 
Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few 
September, November 
And these few precious days I'll spend with you 
These precious days I'll spend with you

 

FRANK SINATRA
SERENADE IN BLUE

 When I hear that serenade in blue 
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you 
Sharing all the joys we used to know, many moons ago. 
Once again your face comes back to me 
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody 
In the album of my memory, serenade in blue 
It seems like only yesterday, the small cafe, a crowded floor 
And as we danced the night away, I hear you say forever more 
And then the song became a sigh 
Forever more became goodbye 
Cause you remained in my heart, but 
Tell me darling in there still a spark? 
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew 
Should I go on whistling in the dark, serenade in blue.

 

FRANK SINATRA
SHE SAYS

 She says she's sleeping well, she says she's lost some weight 
She says she's seen some shows, she says the city's strange 
(So she says) She says the weather's cold, she says there's been some rain 
She says there's lots to see, she says she hopes we're fine (So she says) 
(So she says) The price is high, high as the sky 
And she says, she says, she's comin' home

 

FRANK SINATRA
SINCE MARIE HAS LEFT PAREE

 There's no guy in France, for in France there's no romance, 
Since Marie has left Paree. 
Every ship that sails took the cargo full of mail, 
'Cause Marie has left Paree. 
No amour, no more like they used to have before, 
There's no Marie, she moved to gay Napoli. 
Say bon voyage, I got to go, 
Where's my corsage? Where's my chapeau? 
Bye bye Paree, I'm off to Napoli. 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
There's no Marie, she flew off to Napoli. 
Say bon voyage, I got to go 
Where's my corsage? Where's my chapeau? 
Bye bye, 'cause Marie has left Paree, 
Bye bye Paree, I'm jumping off to Napoli.

SO IN LOVE (REPRISE)

 Strange dear, but true, dear, when I'm close to you, dear 
The stars fill the sky, so in love with you am I. 
Even without you, my arms fold about you, 
You know darling why, so in love with you am I. 
In love with the night mysterious, the night when you first were there. 
In love with my joy delirious, when I knew that you could care. 
So taunt me, and hurt me, deceive me, desert me, 
I'm yours till I die, so in love, so in love so in love with you, my love, am I.

 

FRANK SINATRA
SOFTLY, AS I LEAVE YOU

 Softly, I will leave you softly 
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go 
So I leave you softly, long before you miss me 
Long before your arms can beg me stay 
For one more hour or one more day 
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall 
So, softly as I leave you there 
 
(Softly, long before you kiss me) 
(Long before your arms can beg me stay) 
(For one more hour) or one more day 
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall 
So, softly as I leave you there 
As I leave I you there 
As I leave I you there

SOLILOQUY

 I wonder what he'll think of me 
I guess he'll call me the old man 
I guess he'll think I can lick 
Ev'ry other fella's father 
Well, I can! 
 
I bet that he turns out to be 
The spittin' image of his dad 
But he'll have more common sense 
Than his puddin' headed father ever had 
 
I'll teach him to wrassle and dive through a wave 
When we go in the morning for our swim 
His mother can teach him the way to behave 
But she won't make a sissy out o' him 
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill! 
 
Bill. I will see that he is named after me, I will. 
My boy, Bill, he'll be tall and tough as a tree, will Bill! 
Like a tree he'll grow with his head held high 
And his feet planted firm on the ground 
And you won't see nobody dare to try to boss or toss him around! 
No pot bellied, baggy eyed bully'll boss him around 
 
I don't give a damn what he does as long as he does what he likes! 
He can sit on his tail or work on a rail with a hammer and hammer in spikes! 
He can ferry a boat on a river or peddle a pack on his back 
Or work up and down the streets of a town with a whip and a horse and a hack 
 
He can haul a scow along a canal, run a cow around a corral 
Or maybe bark for a carousel 
Of course, it takes talent to do that well 
 
 
He might be a champ of the heavyweights or a fella that sells you glue 
Or President of the United States, that'd be all right, too 
 
[Spoken:] 
His mother would like that, but he wouldn't be President unless he wanted to be 
 
Not Bill! 
 
My boy, Bill he'll be tall and as tough as a tree, will Bill 
Like a tree he'll grow with his head held high 
And his feet planted firm on the ground 
And you won't see nobody dare to try to boss or toss him around! 
No fat bottomed, flabby faced, pot bellied, baggy eyed bully'll boss him around 
 
And I'll be damned if he'll marry his boss's daughter 
A skinny lipped virgin with blood like water 
Who'll give him a peck and call it a kiss 
And look in his eyes through a *lorgnette* 
Hey, why am I takin' on like this? 
My kid ain't even been born yet! 
 
I can see him when he's seventeen or so and startin' in to go with a girl 
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound, on the way to get 'round any girl 
I can tell him 
Wait a minute! 
Could it be? 
What the hell! 
What if he is a girl? 
You can have fun with a son 
But you got to be a father to a girl 
 
She mighn't be so bad,at that 
A kid with ribbons in her hair! 
A kind of neat and petite little tin type of her mother! 
What a pair! 
 
My little girl, pink and white as peaches and cream is she 
My little girl is half again as bright as girls were meant to be! 
Dozens of boys pursue her, many a likely lad 
Does what he can to woo her from her faithful dad 
 
She has a few pink and white young fellas of two and three 
But my little girl gets hungry ev'ry night and she comes home to me! 
 
I gotta get ready before she comes 
Gotta make certain that she won't be dragged up in slums with a lot o' bums like me 
She's gotta be sheltered and fed and dressed in the best that money can buy! 
I never knew how to get money but, I'll try, by God! I'll try! 
I'll go out and make it or steal it 
Or take it or die!

SOME ENCHANTED EVENING

 Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger, 
You may see a stranger across a crowded room, 
And somehow you know, you know even then, 
That somehow you'll see here again and again. 
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing, 
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room, 
And night after night, as strange as it seems, 
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams. 
Who can explain it, who can tell you why? 
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try. 
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love, 
When you hear her call you across a crowded room, 
Then fly to her side and make her your own, 
Or all through your life you may dream all alone. 
Once you have found her, never let her go, 
Once you have found her, never let her go.

SOME TRAVELING MUSIC

 [music intro] 
 
How can you say something new about being alone, 
Tell somebody you're a loner? 
Right away they think you're lonely, 
It's not the same thing, you know. 
It's not wanting to put all your marbles in one pocket. 
And that's caring enough not to care too much. 
Mostly, I guess it's letting yourself come first for a while. 
 
[music interlude] 
 
One day, I'm gonna find me an island, a think place, 
Go there with a mess of records and a ukalele, 
Just sit strumming, I might even do some thinking, 
About the women and the towns that I left behind.

SOMEONE TO LIGHT UP MY LIFE

 Go on your way with the cloudless blue sky above 
May all your days be a wonderful song of love 
Open your arms and sing of all the hidden hopes you'll ever treasure 
And live out your life in peace 
Where shall I look for the love to replace you, someone to light up my life 
Someone with strange little ways, eyes like a blue autumn haze 
Someone with your laughing style, 
And a smile that I know will keep haunting me endlessly 
Sometimes in stars or the swift flight of seabirds, I catch a moment of you 
Thats why I walk all alone. searching for something unknown 
Searching for something or someone to light up my life

 

FRANK SINATRA
SOMETHIN' STUPID

 I know I stand in line until you think you have the time 
To spend an evening with me 
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance 
You won't be leaving with me 
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two 
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I love you 
 
I can see it in your eyes 
That you despise the same old lies you heard the night before 
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true 
And never seemed so right before 
 
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say 
To make the meaning come through 
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late and I'm alone with you 
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red and, oh, the night's so blue 
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I love you 
 
[instrumental]

 Somewhere in your heart, try to find a place for me 
Somewhere in your heart, I won't care where it might be 
One little corner may not mean so much to you 
But one little corner would be enough to see me through 
 
Somewhere in your dreams, let my lips come close to you 
Though they're only dreams, someday they may all come true 
Is it so much to ask for such a tiny part? 
Won't you find a place for me, somewhere in your heart?

SOMEWHERE MY LOVE

 Somewhere, my love, there will be songs to sing 
Although the snow covers the hopes of Spring 
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold 
And there are dreams, all that your heart can hold 
Someday we'll meet again, my love 
Someday whenever the Spring breaks through 
 
You'll come to me out of the long ago 
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow 
Till then, my sweet, think of me now and then 
Godspeed, my love, till you are mine again

Someday we'll meet again, my love

Godspeed, my love, till you are mine again!

But when ya take the blues and make a song 
Ya sing 'em out again 
 
Song sung blue, weepin' like a willow 
Song sung blue, sleepin' on my pillow 
Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice 
And before you know, it starts to feelin' good 
Ya simply got no choice

SOUTH TO A WARMER PLACE

 I'd be glad to stay right here with you 
Fact is, that is what I'd planned to 
But from that fool look on your face 
I think I'll head South to a warmer place 
 
Thought I'd given you the best of me 
I'd be glad to share the rest of me 
But there's a chill in your embrace 
So, I'd better head South to a warmer place 
 
Seems like yesterday we could kiss and build a fire 
But now it's ten below 
Seems like yesterday nights were warm with love's desire 
But now it feels like snow 
 
I don't mind a cold day now and then 
But this long deep freeze has done me in 
And it's too late to plead your case 
So I'm goin' South to a warmer place

STAR!

 If the lady's naughty but proper 
If the lady's chic er than chic 
If her escorts must wear a topper 
And each man's the man of the week 
If she rides around in a brand new foreign car 
The chances are the lady's a star 
 
If the lady's utterly charming 
If the lady's chummy with kings 
If her whims are close to alarming 
And it's known she's thrown a few things 
If they've got a drink with her name in Jilly's bar 
The chances are the lady's a star 
 
If her smallest party is really expensive with tons of expensive caviar 
If the lady is someone with the same credentials 
Someone with the same essentials 
Someone who is worshipped from afar 
She's a genuine, positive, totally, marvelous, perfectly, wonderful 
She's a great big, great big star!

(When our love was new) and each kiss an inspiration 
Oh, but that was long ago, and now my consolation is in the 
stardust of a song 
 
(And beside a garden wall, when the stars were bright) 
You were in my arms, the nightingale told its fairy tale of paradise where roses grew. 
Though I dream in vain, in my heart it always will remain 
My stardust melody (the memory of love's refrain)

STARGAZER

 Stargazer! You with your head in the heavens, 
You'll never get by, walking that high off the ground. 
Hey, moon dreamer, I've been around and I see it, 
That higher you get, the harder they let you down. 
You pay your dues, it seems forever, 
And if you're clever, you may be in for a while, then you're out of style. 
Hey, stargazer, probably think I'm crazy, and you haven't heard one single word I said. 
No I don't want to burst your bubble, but you got trouble, 
Don't you know the higher the top, the longer the drop, 
Hey, stargazer (jump on it, Sam, get all over that thing!). 
No I don't want to burst your bubble, but you got trouble, 
Don't you know the higher the top, the longer the drop, 
Hey, stargazer! Stargazer, stargazer, stargazer! You moon dreamer, you moon dreamer!

STAY WITH ME (MAIN THEME FROM THE CARDINAL)

 Should my heart not be humble, should my eyes fail to see, 
Should my feet sometimes stumble on the way, stay with me. 
Like the lamb that in springtime wanders far from fold, 
Comes the darkness and the frost, I get lost, I grow cold. 
I grow cold, I grow weary, and I know I have sinned, 
And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind, 
And though I grope and I blunder and I kneel and I'm wrong, 
Though the rose buckles under where I walk, walk along 
Till I find to my wonder every task least to see, 
Or that I can do it, pray, stay with me. 
Stay with me.

STORMY WEATHER

 Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky 
Stormy weather 
Since my gal and I ain't together 
Keeps rainin' all the time 
 
Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere 
Stormy weather 
Just can't get my poor old self together 
I'm weary all the time, the time 
So weary all the time 
 
When she went away, the blues walked in and they met me 
If she stays away, that old rockin' chair's gonna get me 
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me 
Walk in the sun once more 
 
Can't go on, everything I had is gone 
Stormy weather 
Since my gal and I ain't together 
Keeps rainin' all the time 
Keeps rainin' all the time

STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT

 Strangers in the night exchanging glances 
Wond'ring in the night what were the chances 
We'd be sharing love before the night was through 
 
Something in your eyes was so inviting 
Something in you smile was so exciting 
Something in my heart told me I must have you 
 
Strangers in the night 
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night 
Up to the moment when we said our first hello little did we know 
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away 
 
and 
 
Ever since that night we've been together 
Lovers at first sight, in love forever 
It turned out so right for strangers in the night 
 
[instrumental first three lines of chorus] 
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away 
 
Ever since that night we've been together 
Lovers at first sight, in love forever 
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

STREET OF DREAMS

 Love laughs at a king, kings don't mean a thing on the street of dreams 
Dreams broken in two can be made like new on the street of dreams 
 
Gold, silver and gold 
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam 
Poor, there ain't nobody poor 
Long as love is sure on the street of dreams 
 
[instrumental] 
 
All the gold, silver and gold 
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam 
Poor, nobody's poor 
Long as love is sure on the street of dreams

STYLE

 (Bing Crosby) [Dean Martin] 
 
Some people dress 'cause they dress when they dress, 
But he gets dressed to get dressed. 
(It's only a hunch but I bet you a bunch) 
(He wears suspenders, a belt and a vest,) 
[From the tip of his toes to his head,] 
[He looks like an unmade bed.] 
 
You've either got or you haven't got style. 
(If you got it, you stand out a mile.) 
A flower's not a flower if it's wilted, 
(A hat's not a hat till it's tilted.) 
[You either got or you haven't got class.] 
[How it draws the applause of the masses.] 
 
 
(You either got, or you haven't got,) 
[Got or you haven't got,] , 
 
You've either got or you haven't got style, (got or you haven't got style). 
[If you got it, it stands out a mile,] (if you got it, it stands out a mile.). 
With mother of pearl kind of buttons, 
(You look like the Astors and Huttons.) 
[You either got or you haven't got class,] (got or you haven't got class.) 
How it draws the applause of the masses. 
 
 
(You've either got, or you haven't style) [got or you haven't got style

SUMMER ME, WINTER ME

 Summer me, winter me 
And with your kisses, morning me, evening me 
And as the world slips far away, a star away 
Forever me with love 
 
Wonder me, wander me 
Then by a fire pleasure me, peaceful me 
And in the silence quietly, whisper me 
Forever me with love 
 
And ev'ry day I'll gentle you, tender you 
And oh, the way I'll velvet you, clover you 
I'll wrap you up and ribbon you, rainbow you 
And shower you with shine! 
 
Suddenly, magically, we found each other 
There we were, here we are 
I plan to let you happy me, summer me, winter me, always

SUMMER WIND

 The summer wind, came blowin' in from across the sea 
It lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me 
All summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand 
Two sweethearts and the summer wind 
 
Like painted kites, those days and nights, they went flyin' by 
The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky 
Then softer than a piper man one day it called to you 
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind 
 
The autumn wind and the winter winds, they have come and gone 
And still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on 
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end 
My fickle friend, the summer wind 
 
The summer wind 
Warm summer wind 
Mmm, the summer wind

SUNNY

 Never comb your hair, sun ny! 
Leave the breez es there, sun ny! 
Let your stock ing fall down, 
For shock ing the town is all that you do. 
Smil ing all the while, tom boy 
Where'd you get your smile from boy? 
Lit tle sun ny girl, 
Be my hon ey girl, I'm for you!

SUNRISE IN THE MORNING

 And on that dawn just when the day was breaking, 
I saw your face everywhere. 
And on that morning, love was in the making, 
I heard your voice, I hear music, I've no care. 
Sunrise in the morning, stay awhile, you know that I'll 
Be thinking of you now and everyday. 
Make it worth my while, I'll see that you will always smile. 
And never stray, you stay baby, I'll pray. 
On that sweet night I looked at moonbeams clearly, 
Moonbeams dancing in your eyes. 
And it was right I know I loved you dearly, 
I saw your face, I hear music, I've no care. 
Sunset in the evening, stay awhile, you know that I'll 
Be thinking of you now and everyday. 
Make it worth my while, I'll see that you will always smile. 
And never stray, you stay, baby, I'll pray. 
Stay awhile, you know that I'll 
Be thinking of you now and everyday. 
Make it worth my while, I'll see that you will always smile. 
And never stray, you stay, baby, I'll pray. 
Please stay, baby, I'll pray. Oh, you stay, baby, I'll pray. 
Please stay, baby I'll pray..

SWEET CAROLINE

 Where it began, I can't begin to knowing 
But then I know it's growing strong 
Was in the spring, then spring became the summer 
Who'd have believed you'd come along. 
Hands, touching hands, reaching out, touching me, touching you 
 
[Chorus:] 
Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good 
I'd be inclined to believe they never would, so good, so good 
 
Look at the night and it don't seem so lonely 
We filled it up with only two, and when I hurt 
Hurting runs off my shoulder 
How can I hurt when I'm holding you 
One, touching one, reaching out, touching me, touching you 
 
[Chorus]

SWEET LORRAINE

 I just found joy 
I'm as happy as a baby boy 
With another brand new choo choo toy 
When I'm with my sweet Lorraine 
 
She got a pair of eyes 
That are bluer than the summer skies 
When you see them you will realize 
Why I love my sweet Lorraine 
 
When it's rainin' I don't miss the sun 
'cause it's in my sweetie's smile 
Just to think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lead her down the aisle 
 
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away 
I can't wait until that happy day 
When I marry sweet Lorraine 
 
[instrumental] 
 
When it's rainin' I never miss the sun 
'cause it's in my sweetie's smile 
Just to think that I'm the lucky one 
Who's gonna lead her down the aisle 
 
Every night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away 
I can't wait until that lucky day 
When I marry Lorraine

SWINGING ON A STAR

 Would you like to swing on a star? 
Carry moonbeams home in a jar? 
And be better off than you are? 
Or would you rather be a mule? 
 
A mule is an animal with long, funny ears 
He kicks up at anything he hears 
His back is brawny and his brain is weak 
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak 
And, by the way, if you hate to go to school 
You may grow up to be a mule 
 
Or would you like to swing on a star? 
Carry moonbeams home in a jar? 
And be better off than you are? 
Or would you rather be a pig? 
 
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face 
His shoes are a terrible disgrace 
He's got no manners when he eats his food 
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude 
But if you don't care a feather or a fig 
You may grow up to be a pig 
 
[instrumental first 3 lines of chorus] 
Or would you rather be a fish? 
 
A fish won't do anything but swim in a brook 
He can't write his name or read a book 
To fool all the people is his only thought 
Though he's slippery, he still gets caught 
But then if that sort of life is what you wish 
You may grow up to be a fish 
 
And all the monkeys aren't in a zoo 
Every day you meet quite a few 
So you see, it's all up to you 
You can be better than you are 
 
You could be swingin' on a star

TAKE ME

 Take me, I'm yours if you'll take me, I want you to make me a part of your heart. 
And hold me, I dreamed you would hold me, now really enfold me, say we'll never part. 
All the love I have to give, I want to give to you, 
And as long as I shall live, I'll only live for you, 
Take me, and never forsake me, 
My darling, please take me and make your own, and make me your own.

 

FRANK SINATRA
TALK TO ME BABY

 If you cannot toss your heart gaily in the ring, 
Love me while the moment lingers, 
If you cannot cross your heart that I'm everything, 
Try at least to cross your fingers. 
Talk to me, baby, tell me lies, 
Tell me lies as sweet as apple pie. 
Whisper you tremble with a wild desire 
To light the fire in my eyes. 
Tell me I'm marvelous, exaggerate! 
Prevaricate if you must. 
Just talk to me, baby, soft and low, 
Then if you decide it's really so, 
Swear you be mine forever, otherwise just talk to me, 
And tell me lies, lies, lies, lies, 
Great, big, great big lies.

TANGERINE

 He: Tangerine, she is all they claim 
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame 
Tangerine, when she dances by, senoritas stare and caballeros sigh 
And I've seen toasts to Tangerine 
Raised in every bar across the Argentine 
Yes, she has them all on the run, but her heart belongs to just one 
Her heart belongs to Tangerine 
She: Tangerine, she is all they say 
With mascara'd eye and chapeaux by Dache. 
Tangerine, with her lips of flame 
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame. 
And I've seen clothes on Tangerine 
Where the label says From Macy's Mezzanine . 
Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl, but she's only fooling one girl 
She's only fooling Tangerine!

TEACH ME TONIGHT

 Did you say (that) I've got a lot to learn, well don't think I'm trying not to learn 
Since this is the perfect spot to learn, teach me tonight 
Starting with the ABC of it, getting right down to the XYZ of it 
Help me solve the mystery of it, teach me tonight 
The sky's a blackboard high above you, a nd if a shooting star goes by 
I'll use that star to write I love you , a thousand times across the sky 
One thing isn't very clear my love, teachers shouldn't stand so near my love 
Graduation's almost here my love, you'd better teach me tonight 
I've played loves scenes in a flick or two, and I've also met a chick or two 
But I still can learn a trick or two, hey teach me tonight 
I who thought I knew the score of it, kind of think I should know much more of it 
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it, hey teach me tonight 
The midnight hours come slowly creeping when there's no one there but you 
There must be more to life than sleeping single in a bed for two 
What I need most is post graduate, what I feel is hard to articulate 
If you want me to matriculate, you'd better teach me tonight 
What do you get for lessons, teach me come on and teach me teach me tonight

TELL HER (YOU LOVE HER EACH DAY)

 (Tell her you love her) each day 
You'll make her happy that way 
A simple I love you means more than money 
And, with a kiss or two her life is sunny 
 
Give her a reason to live 
She needs the love that you give 
Always remember that is what she lives for 
She hopes you love her 
Tell her you love her 
Tell her you love her today 
 
(Give her a reason to live) 
(She needs the love that you give) 
Always remember that is what she lives for 
She hopes you love her 
Tell her you love her 
Tell her you love her today

THANKS FOR THE MEMORY

 Thanks for the memory 
Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet 
Our wond'rous week in Martinique and Vegas and roulette 
How lucky I was 
 
And thanks for the memory 
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki 
We had a pad in London but we didn't stop for tea 
How cozy it was 
 
Now since our breakup I wake up 
Alone on a gray morning after 
I long for the sound of your laughter 
And then I see the laugh's on me 
 
But, thanks for the memory 
Of every touch a thrill, I've been through the mill 
I've lived a lot and learned a lot, you loved me not and still 
I miss you so much 
 
Thanks for the memory 
Of how we used to jog even in a fog 
That barbecue in Malibu, away from all the smog 
How rainy it was 
 
Thanks for the memory 
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed 
Tonight the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud 
How brainy he was 
 
Gone are those evenings on Broadway 
Together we'd go to a great show 
But now I begin with the Late Show 
And wish that you were watching, too 
 
I know it's a fallacy 
That grown men never cry, baby, that's a lie 
We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die 
And thank you so much

 

FRANK SINATRA
THAT'S ALL

 I can only give you love that lasts forever, 
And the promise to be near each time you call, 
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all. 
I can only give you country walks in springtime, 
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall, 
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all. 
There are those I am sure who have told you, 
They will give you the world for a toy. 
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy. 
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear, 
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small. 
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.

THAT'S LIFE

 That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say 
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May 
But I know I'm gonna change that tune 
When I'm back on top, back on top in June 
 
I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem 
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream 
But I don't let it, let it get me down 
'cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around 
 
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king 
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing 
Each time I find myself flat on my face 
I pick myself up and get back in the race 
 
That's life (that's life), I tell you I can't deny it 
I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it 
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try 
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly 
 
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king 
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing 
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face 
I just pick myself up and get back in the race 
 
That's life (that's life), that's life and I can't deny it 
Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it 
But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July 
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball a and die 
 
My, my!

THAT'S WHAT GOD LOOKS LIKE TO ME

 One day as I walked with my son hand in hand, 
He said, there are things that I don't understand, 
How high is the sky? what makes it so blue? 
And tell me, dad, what does God look like to you? 
I said, He looks like a rainbow, just after the rain, 
He's as golden as wheat dancing over the plain. 
He looks like the star when the night's crystal clear, 
He looks like a baby when mother is near. 
His face is the moonlight reflected on snow, 
His hair like garden where all flowers grow, 
He's heavenly eyes are as true as the sea, 
My son, that's what God really looks like. 
His heart like a mountain so vast and so strong, 
That's why all his children have room to belong. 
His smile is the morning we waken to see, 
But you, my son, you are what God really looks like to me.

THE BEAUTIFUL STRANGERS

 All the beautiful strangers who held me for a night, 
And fell down in the darkness on pillows soft and white, 
All the beautiful strangers, all in the afternoon, 
Who praised my flat little summer, and came back to my room, 
All the beautiful strangers, they spoiled me for a time, 
And they taught me neon's just as nice as afternoon sunshine.

THE BEST IS YET TO COME

 Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum 
You came along and everything's startin' to hum 
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come 
 
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine? 
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine 
 
a Wait till the warm up's underway 
Wait till our lips have met 
And wait till you see that sunshine day 
You ain't seen nothin' yet 
 
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine? 
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine 
 
Come the day you're mine 
I'm gonna teach you to fly 
We've only tasted the wine 
We're gonna drain the cup dry 
 
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround 
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground 
 
a Wait till you're locked in my embrace 
Wait till I draw you near 
a Wait till you see that sunshine place 
Ain't nothin' like it here 
 
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine? 
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine 
 
Come the day you're mine 
And you're gonna be mine

THE BEST OF EVERYTHING

 The best of everything that's (that is) what I wish you all 
The best of everything a Rembrandt (hanging) on your (the) wall 
A yacht that wins you cups, skateboards with style and speed 
Show dogs or loving pups, the pride of the pound or the pedigreed 
I hope you win that prize pass that blue ribbon test 
I hope your good keeps getting better 'til your better's best 
With every wine you taste, with every song you sing 
By now you may have guest, I hope you get the best of everything

Hey there, buster, it's the indians after custer, it's the. 
The boys' night out.

The night they lost the titanic and the wall street panic. 
What they're seeking is a little chickie chicking, it's the.. 
The boys' night out,

THE CHRISTMAS WALTZ

 Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside 
Painted candy canes on the tree 
Santa's on his way, he's filled his sleigh with things 
Things for you and for me 
 
It's that time of year when the world falls in love 
Ev'ry song you hear seems to say Merry Christmas, 
 May your New Year dreams come true 
And this song of mine in three quarter time 
Wishes you and yours the same thing, too

THE COFFEE SONG

 Way down among Brazilians 
Coffee beans grow by the billions 
So they've got to find those extra cups to fill 
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil 
 
You can't get cherry soda 
'cause they've got to fill that quota 
And the way things are I'll bet they never will 
They've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil 
 
No tea or tomato juice 
You'll see no potato juice 
'cause the planters down in Santos all say No, no, no 
 
The politician's daughter 
Was accused of drinkin' water 
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill 
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil 
 
[instrumental break] 
 
You date a girl and find out later 
She smells just like a percolator 
Her perfume was made right on the grill 
Why, they could percolate the ocean in Brazil 
 
And when their ham and eggs need savor 
Coffee ketchup gives 'em flavor 
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill 
Why, they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil 
 
No tea, no tomato juice 
You'll see no potato juice 
The planters down in Santos all say No, no, no < 
 
So you'll add to the local color 
Serving coffee with a cruller 
Dunkin' doesn't take a lot of skill 
They've got an awful lot of coffee 
An awful lot of coffee 
Man, they got a gang of coffee in Brazil!!

THE CONTINENTAL

 Beautiful music 
Dangerous rhythm 
 
It's something daring, the Continental 
A way of dancing that's really ultra new 
It's very subtle, the Continental 
Because it does what you want it to do 
 
It has a passion, the Continental 
An invitation to moonlight and romance 
It's quite the fashion, the Continental 
Because you tell of your love while you dance 
 
You kiss while you're dancing 
It's continental, ooh, it's continental 
You sing while you're dancing 
Your voice is gentle and so sentimental 
 
You'll know before the dance is through 
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you 
You'll find while you're dancin' 
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul 
A certain rhythm that you can't control 
And you will do the Continental all the time 
 
[brief instrumental] 
 
You'll find while you're dancin' 
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul 
A certain rhythm that you can't control 
And you will do the Continental all the time 
 
Beautiful music 
Dangerous rhythm 
 
The Continental!

THE CURSE OF AN ACHING HEART

 You made me what I am today, I hope you're satisfied, 
You dragged and dragged me down until the soul within me died. 
You've shattered each and every dream, fooled me right from the start. 
And though you're not true, may God bless you, 
That's the curse of an aching heart. 
(musical interlude) 
You made me what I am today, I should hope you're satisfied, 
You dragged, you dragged me down until the soul within me died. 
You've shattered each and every dream, you fooled me right from the start. 
And although you're not true, may God bless you, 
That's the curse of an aching heart.

THE FUTURE

 (feat. Beverly Jenkins) 
 
[Alto solo by Beverly Jenkins] (chorus) 
 
[Gonna find me a gypsy and get my fortune told,] 
[I'm gonna find me a gypsy and get my fortune told.] 
[I'm gonna say please, missus gypsy, tell me what the future will hold.] 
(Hurry your deck of cards and your crystal ball) 
(For there you will see that you will pray for light) 
(The future will almost certainly be whatever you want it to be,) 
(But with rockets and picks, from music and jetsam) 
(There's no butt that you can push, and push,) 
(Let your imagination burst into flame) 
(And it will let you do whatever you damn well to do, do,do). 
 
Given a choice I would choose to have a magic wand that I could use, 
To draw a melody, from that enchanted blade of grass 
And cheese and wood and wind and sea. 
I would stand there, dig a grave, and quietly say, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, play for me, play for me. 
(and the orchestra plays a beautiful melody)

THE FUTURE (CONCLUSION) SONG WITHOUT WORDS

 (feat. Loulie Jean Norman, Beverly Jenkins) 
 
[Alto solo by Beverly Jenkins] (chorus) 
 
(Your imagination has an awful lot to give) 
(If our right to live were yours hauntingly) 
 
 
(full musical interlude with chorus) 
 
(brief transition) 
If a man has a story that he badly needs to tell, 
A man's imagination makes a lovely wishing well, 
(make a wish, make a wish) 
I wish I could write a song everyone alive could understand, 
(A song that a Frenchman could sing to a Spaniard) 
(A song that a German could sing to a Russian) 
(A song that if ever you'd sing, you are king) 
(Wouldn't it be wonderful, won't it be grand) 
To write a song that the whole wide world could understand. 
(lala , lalala, lala, lala, lalala, lala) 
(lalalala, lalalala, lala, lalala, lalala) 
lalala, lalalala, lala, lalala, lalalala, lala) 
lalala, lalalala, lala, lalala. lalala) 
(music and repeat) 
[Gonna find me a gypsy and get my fortune told,] 
[I'm gonna say, please missus gypsy, tell me what the future will hold] 
(Tell us what the future will hold.)

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE FUTURE (CONTINUED) I'VE BEEN THERE!

 Frank with (chorus) 
 
(If the future proves sweet, would it tell us to leap before we move,) 
(Would it care for us to live with danger or face the final foe,) 
(If tomorrow brings us love, you can bet,) 
(We will need all the help we can get.) 
(And to tell me how this moves everyone of us to you.) 
(How you're glad its winter, how you're glad to say it's true.) 
 
When I see a young couple walking slowly through the trees, 
I don't have to follow them to know how far they'll go, 
I've been there. 
If the boy is sulking and the girl is close to tears, 
I know it doesn't matter, who is right or who started the fight, 
I've been there. 
I've been there when the music played old songs, 
Young songs, good songs, bad songs, sweet songs, sad songs. 
I've been there when a pretty smile made it difficult to breathe, 
But so easy to fly and a pleasure to cry, 
So to all of you in the throes of early love, 
Where delightful confusion reigns supreme, 
Let me try to help you rearrange your dream, 
Let yourself live, let yourself love, let yourself go. 
I've been there, and I know.

THE GAL THAT GOT AWAY

 The night is bitter, the stars have lost their glitter 
The winds grow colder, suddenly you're a lot older 
And all because of a gal who got away 
No more her eager call, the writing is on the wall 
All those dreams you dreamed, they have all gone astray 
 
The gal who won you, she's run off and undone you 
That great beginning has seen the final inning 
I don't know what happened, its all a crazy game 
No more no more that all time thrill because you have been put though the mill 
And never a new love will ever be the same 
 
Good riddance, good bye 
Every trick of hers you are on to 
But fools will be fools and where's she gone? 
Where has she gone? 
 
The road gets rougher, it's lonelier and it's tougher 
With hope ya burn up, tomorrow maybe she'll turn up 
There ain't no let up, live long night, night and day 
 
Ever since, since this world began 
There ain't nothin' sadder than 
A long lost loser 
Lookin' for his gal who got away 
 
Please come back 
Won't ya come back? 
 
Mm, mm, mm 
Mm mmmm

THE GAME IS OVER

 Time, there was a time you could talk to me without speaking, 
You would look at me, and I'd know all there is to know. 
Days I think of you, and remember the lies we told in the night, 
The love we knew, the things we shared, when our hearts were fitting together. 
Days that were so few, full of love and you. 
Gone,. the days are gone now, days that seem so wrong now. 
Life won't be the same without you, to hold again in my arms, 
To ease the pain and remember when our love was the reason for living. 
(instrumental) 
Days that were so few, full of love and you. 
The game is over.

THE GIRL FROM IPANEMA

 Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking 
And when she passes, each one she passes goes ah 
When she walks, she's like a samba that swings so cool and sways so gentle 
That when she passes, each one she passes goes ooh 
(Ooh) But I watch her so sadly, how can I tell her I love her 
Yes I would give my heart gladly, 
But each day, when she walks to the sea 
She looks straight ahead, not at me 
Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking 
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see (doesn't see) 
(She just doesn't see, she never sees me,...)

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE GIRL NEXT DOOR

 The moment I saw her face, I knew she was just my style. 
My only regret is we've never met for I dream of her all the while, 
But she doesn't know I exist, no matter how I persist. 
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me, 
Though I live at fifty one thirty five Kensngton Avenue, 
And she lives at fifty one thirty three. 
 
How can I ignore the girl next door, I love her more than I can say. 
Doesn't try to please me, doesn't even tease me, 
And she never sees me glance her way. 
And I thought I'm heartsore, the girl next door 
Affection for me won't display. 
I just adore her so I can't ignore her, the girl next door.

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE GIRLS I NEVER KISSED

 The old wolf sniffs the summer breeze, and dreams about his youth, 
For the sight of skirts above the knees turns his hardboiled brain to tears. 
And the scent of honey in the tree whets an old sweet tooth. 
The pretty girls go strolling by, I smile at them, and heave a sigh. 
And think of all the things I've missed, and all the pretty girls I've never kissed. 
They smile from field of daffodils, they wave from high and windy hills, 
In secret places by the sea, the girls I've never kissed still wait for me. 
All the girls whose names I can't recall, their faces haunt me still, 
All the pretty girls I've never kissed and never will. 
The girls of spring, the girls of fall, the girls of summer most of all, 
If only time did not exist, if only I could catch that boat I always missed, 
I'd go back and kiss all the pretty girls I've never kissed.

THE GOOD LIFE

 It's the good life, full of fun, seems to be the ideal, 
Yes, the good life, lest you hide all the sadness you feel, 
You won't really fall in love 'cause you can't take the chance, 
So be honest with yourself, don't try to fake romance. 
Yes, the good life, to be free and explore the unknown, 
Like the heartache when you learn you must face them alone, 
Please remember I still want you and in case you wonder why, 
Well, just wake up, kiss that good life goodbye. 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
Please remember I still want you and in case you wonder why, 
Well, just wake up, kiss that good life goodbye.

THE GYPSY

 In a quaint caravan there's a lady they call The Gypsy, 
She can look at the future and drive away all your fears, 
Everything will come out right if you only believe The Gypsy, 
She can tell at a glance that my heart was full of tears. 
She looked at my hand and told me my lover was always true, 
But deep in my heart I knew dear, somebody else was kissing you. 
I will go there again 'cause I want to believe The Gypsy, 
That my lover is true and she'll come back to me someday.

THE HOUSE I LIVE IN

 [Intro:] 
What is America to me? 
A name, a map, or a flag I see? 
A certain word, democracy ? 
What is America to me? 
 
The house I live in, a plot of earth, a street 
The grocer and the butcher, and the people that I meet 
The children in the playground, the faces that I see 
All races and religions, that's America to me 
 
The place I work in, the worker by my side 
The little town or city where my people lived and died 
The howdy and the handshake, the air of feeling free 
And the right to speak my mind out, that's America to me 
 
The things I see about me, the big things and the small 
The little corner newsstand and the house a mile tall 
The wedding in the churchyard, the laughter and the tears 
The dream that's been a growin' for a hundred and fifty years 
 
The town I live in, the street, the house, the room 
The pavement of the city, or a garden all in bloom 
The church, the school, the clubhouse, the millions lights I see 
But especially the people 
That's America to me

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE HURT DOESN'T GO AWAY

 The hurt doesn't go away, the tears never cease to fall, 
You cover them over with people and places, 
Hoping you'll want to break away. 
Oh my darling, the pain doesn't go away, 
When love doesn't want to stay. 
And inside your laughter, the world's laughing too, 
Saying you'll never make one more day. 
All the nonsense of it and oh, the pain doesn't go away. 
The tears never cease to fall, the hurt doesn't go away. 
The pain doesn't go away.

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM

 To dream the impossible dream 
To fight the unbeatable foe 
To bear with unbearable sorrow 
To run where the brave dare not go 
 
To right the unrightable wrong 
(1)To be better far than you are(1) 
To try when your arms are too weary 
To reach the unreachable star 
 
This is my quest, to follow that star 
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far 
(2)To be willing to give when there's no more to give (2) 
(3)To be willing to die so that honor and justice may live (3) 
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest 
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest 
 
And the world will be better for this 
That one man, scorned and covered with scars, 
Still strove with his last ounce of courage 
To reach the unreachable star 
 
[Notes:] 
The Broadway cast's version is quite similar with a few exceptions: 
(1)To love pure and chaste from afar 
(2)To fight for the right without question or pause 
(3)To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause

THE LAST DANCE

 It's the last dance, we've come to the last dance 
They're dimming the lights down, they're hoping we'll go 
It's obvious they're aware of us, the pair of us, alone on the floor 
Still I want to hold you like this forever and more 
 
It the last song, they're playing the last song 
The orchestra's yawning, they're sleepy I know 
They're wondering just when will we leave, but till we leave, keep holding me tight 
Through the last dance, each beat of the last dance 
Save me the first dance in your dreams tonight 
 
 
[instrumental strings and clarinet]

THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY

 Come they told me (pa rum pum pum pum) 
A newborn King to see (pa rum pum pum pum) 
Our finest gifts we bring pa rum pum pum pum 
To lay before the King 
So to honor Him (pa rum pum pum pum) 
when we come 
 
Little Baby (pa rum pum pum pum) 
I am a poor boy too (pa rum pum pum pum) 
I have no gift to bring (pa rum pum pum pum) 
that's fit to give our King 
Shall I play for You? (pa rum pum pum pum) 
On my drum 
 
Mary nodded (pa rum pum pum pum) 
The ox and lamb kept time (pa rum pum pum pum) 
I played my drum for Him (pa rum pum pum pum) 
I played my best for Him 
Then He smiled at me (pa rum pum pum pum) 
Me and my drum

THE LOOK OF LOVE

 I've seen the look of a baby with a rattle 
I've seen the look of a hero in a battle 
I've seen the look of a heartsick turtle dove 
But the look that leaves ya real shook is the look of love 
 
I've seen the look of a jockey on a winner 
I've seen the look of a fat man havin' dinner 
I've seen the look of those spacemen up above 
But the look that closes the book is the look of love 
 
It's thunder, it's lightning, the gentlest breeze 
It's friendly, it's frightening 
And more surprising than an elephant's sneeze 
 
I've seen the look every single blushing bride has 
I've seen the look that the fellow by her side has 
But there's one look that I'd give my life to see 
We are locked in a wondrous embrace 
And there on that fabulous face 
Is that fabulous look of love for me 
 
[instrumental first two lines of last verse] 
 
But there's one look that I'd give my life to see 
We are locked in a wondrous embrace 
And there on that fabulous face 
Is that fabulous look of love for me 
 
That's what I wanna see 
That look of love for me

THE MAN IN THE LOOKING GLASS

 [Intro:] 
I've seen that face before, that face that I see in the mirror 
I know that face, I've seen that face before 
I knew that dopey guy when he didn't know how to tie his tie 
He stood right there and he had hair galore 
 
The man in the looking glass, who can he be? 
The man in the looking glass, can he possibly be me? 
Where's our young Romeo, the lad who used to sigh? 
Who's the middle aged lothario with a twinkle in his eye? 
He seem so much wiser now, less lonely but then 
Could be he's only pretending again 
Man in the looking glass, smiling away, how's your sacroiliac today? 
 
Where's your first love affair, that tragedy d'amour? 
The true love you thought would be the end of you for sure 
Man in the looking glass, have no regrets 
The man who's wise never forgets 
That life is worth living if once in a while 
You can look in that looking glass and smile

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE MOON GOT IN MY EYES

 Out of the darkness you suddenly appeared 
You smiled and I was taken by surprise 
I guess I should have seen right through you 
But the moon got in my eyes. 
I was so thrilled by the love you volunteered, 
I gave my heart without a compromise 
I guess you don't remember, do you? 
When the moon got in my eyes 
I thought a kingdom was in sight 
That I would have the right to claim 
But with the morning's early light 
I didn't have a dream to my name 
You know the saying that all who love are blind; 
It seems that ancient adage still applies. 
I guess I should have seen right through you, 
But the moon got in my eyes

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE MOON WAS YELLOW (AND THE NIGHT WAS YOUNG)

 The moon was yellow, and the night was young. 
A smile brought us together, and I was wond'ring whether 
We'd meet again someday. 
The moon was yellow, and a song was sung. 
That vocal inspiration gave me the inclination 
To give my heart away. 
Here we are! Is our romance to continue? 
Will it be my luck to win you. 
May I look that far? Ah! My love is 
Ah, my love is yellow and the night is young.

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD

 The most beautiful girl in the world picks my ties out 
She eats my candy, she drinks my brandy 
The most beautiful girl in the world 
The most beautiful star in the world, 'tisn't Garbo 
T'sn't Dietrich, but a sweet trick 
Who can make me believe it's a beautiful world 
Social ? Not a bit! Natural kind of wit 
She'd shine anywhere, and she hasn't got platinum hair 
The most beautiful house in the world has a mortgage 
What do I care ? It's Good bye, care 
When my slippers are next to the ones that belong 
To the one and only beautiful girl in the world 
 
[lengthy instrumental break]

THE OLDEST ESTABLISHED (PERMANENT FLOATING CRAP GAME IN NEW YORK)

 Nathan, you must concentrate on the game. The town is up to here with high players. The Greek's in 
town. Freddie Bottle Bates, Scranton Slim. 
Nathan: I know, I know, I could make a fortune, but to make a fortune, I need a fortune. A thousand 
bucks, where do I get it? 
 
The Biltmore Garage wants a grand, but we ain't got a grand on hand. 
And they now got a lock on the door to the gym at Public School 84. 
There's a stock room behind McKlosky's Bar, but Mrs. McKlosky ain't a good scout. 
And things being how they are, the back of the police station is out! 
So the Biltmore Garage is the spot, but the one thousand bucks we ain't got. 
 
Why, it's good old reliable Nathan, Nathan, Nathan, Nathan Detroit, 
If you're looking for action, he'll turn it to spot, 
Even when the heat is on, it's never too hot. 
But for the good old reliable Nathan, oh it's only just a short walk, 
To the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New Yawk. 
There are well heeled shooters everywhere, everywhere, 
There are well heeled shooters everywhere, 
And awful lot of lettuce for the fella who can get us to play. 
If we only had a lousy little crap, we could be a millionaire. 
Oh the good old reliable Nathan, Nathan, Nathan, Nathan Detroit, 
If the size of your bundle you want to increase, 
I'll arrange that you go broke in quiet and peace, 
In a hideout provided by Nathan, where there are no neighbors to squawk, 
It's the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New Yawk. 
Where's the action? Where's the game? 
Gotta have the game or we'll die from shame. 
It's the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York.

THE ONE I LOVE BELONGS TO SOMEBODY ELSE

 The one I love belongs to somebody else 
She means her tender songs for somebody else 
And even when I have my arms around her 
I know her thoughts are strong for somebody else 
The hands I held belong to somebody else 
I'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else 
It's tough to be alone on the shelf 
It's worse to fall in love by yourself 
The one I love belongs to somebody else 
The one I love belongs to somebody else

THE ONLY COUPLE ON THE FLOOR

 The band played songs from years ago, 
There wasn't one we didn't know, 
The singer's voice was soft and low, 
The lights came on, we didn't know 
 
 
I held your body close to mine, 
Your eyes were closed and so were mine. 
I fell in love with you once more, 
Just like a million times before. 
 
 
Then I awoke, I was alone, my dreams like you have come and gone. 
Tonight I'll hold you one more time, and dream your eyes are closed like mine.

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE SADDEST THING OF ALL

 Through a blurry window out above the rooftop, 
I keep looking at the rain swept sky 
In this small apartment where she used to love me, 
I just sit here as my life goes by. 
There's no doorbell ringing, no sweet sounds of singing, 
Just a silent room where tears won't dry. 
Life is sad when people hurt you, sad when friends desert you, 
Sad when dreams get lost beyond recall, 
But remembering that love stopped blossoming, 
And that's the saddest thing of all. 
Once we had it made, our days one grand parade 
Of thrills and laughter, only lovers know, 
She was proud of me and we were young and free 
One touch was all it took, and off we go, 
Now above the rain, I hear a passing plane, 
And all my loneliness begins to show. 
Life is sad when people hurt you, sad when friends desert you, 
Sad when dreams get lost beyond recall, 
But remembering from spring to lonely spring, 
Well, that's the saddest thing of all.

THE SECOND TIME AROUND

 Love is lovelier the second time around 
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground 
It's that second time you hear your love song sung 
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young 
 
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall 
Like a friendly home the second time you call 
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found? 
There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet 
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

THE SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS

 One day you turn around and it's summer 
Next day you turn around and it's fall 
And the springs and the winters of a lifetime 
Whatever happened to them all? 
 
As a man who has always had the wand'ring ways 
Now I'm reaching back for yesterdays 
'Til a long forgotten love appears 
And I find that I'm sighing softly as I near 
September, the warm September of my years 
 
As I man who has never paused at wishing wells 
Now I'm watching children's carousels 
And their laughter's music to my ears 
And I find that I'm smiling gently as I near 
September, the warm September of my years 
 
The golden warm September of my years

THE SINGLE MAN

 I live alone, that hasn't always been easy to do for just a single man 
Sometimes it's nice the walls talk back to me, 
They seem to say, wasn't yesterday a better day? 
Always alone, at home or in a crowd, 
A single man off on his private cloud, 
'Cause in a world that few men understand, 
I am what I am, the single man. 
Once was a time, I can't remember when, 
The house was filled with love, but then again, 
It might have been imagination's plan 
To help along a single man.

THE SONG IS ENDED

 My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance 
A moment of bliss we spent 
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance 
As into the night we went 
And sang to our hearts' content 
 
The song is ended 
But the melody lingers on 
You and the song are gone 
But the melody lingers on 
 
The night was splendid 
And the melody seemed to say 
 Summer will pass away 
Take your happiness while you may 
 
There 'neath the light of the moon 
We sang a love song that ended too soon 
 
The moon descended 
And I found with the break of dawn 
You and the song had gone 
But the melody lingers on

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE SONG IS YOU

 I hear music when I look at you 
A beautiful theme of every dream I ever knew 
Down deep in my heart I hear it play 
I can feel it start, then it melts away 
 
I hear music when I touch your hand 
A beautiful melody from some enchanted land 
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say 
 Is this the day? 
 
I alone have heard this lovely strain 
I alone have heard this glad refrain 
Must it be forever inside of me? 
Why can't I let it go? Why can't I let you know? 
 
Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing? 
Beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring 
The music is sweet, and the words are true 
The song is you 
 
[instrumental] 
 
Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing? 
That beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring 
The music is sweet, and the words are true 
The song is you

THE SONG OF THE SABIA

 I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, that my place is there, 
And there it will always be, there where I can hear the Song of the Sabia. 
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, I will lie in the shadow of 
A palm that's no longer there, and pick a flower that doesn't grow. 
And maybe someone's love will speak the night. 
The lonely unwanted light that may bring me through the new day. 
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, they won't be in vain, 
All the plans I made to deceive myself, all the rose I made just to lose myself, 
All the love I made to forget myself, those mistakes I made just to find myself. 
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, that my place is there, 
And there it will always be, there where I can hear the Song of the Sabia. 
Of the Sabia.

THE SUMMER KNOWS

 The summer smiles, the summer knows, and unashamed, she sheds her clothes. 
The summer smoothes the restless sky, 
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie. 
The summer knows, the summer's wise, she sees the doubts within your eyes, 
And so she takes her summertime, tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger, 
Twist the world around her summer finger. 
Lets you see the wonder of it all, 
And if you learned your lesson well, 
There's little more for her to tell, 
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall.

 

FRANK SINATRA
THE TRAIN

 And now the sun has broken through, it looks like it will stay 
Just can't have you comin' home on such a rainy day 
The train is leaving Ellensville, unless my watch is fast 
The kids are comin' home from school, must be quarter past 
So many changes since you've been away, and there's so many things to say 
This time around you'll want to stay, 'cuz I've had so many nights to find the way 
Even bought that summer cottage yesterday, pretty soon I'll be close to you 
And it will be so good, we'll talk about the part of you I never understood, 
And I will take good care of you, and never let you cry 
We will look so much in love to people passing by 
So many changes since you've been away, and there's so many things to say 
I wrote so many times and more, but the letters still are lying in my drawer 
'Cuz the morning mail had left some time before 
All the passengers for Allentown wait closer to the track 
It's hard for me to realize you're really coming back 
The crossing gate is coming down I think I see the train 
The sun has gone and now my face is wet with heavy rain 
The passengers for Allentown are gone, the train is slowly moving on 
But I can't see you any place, and I know for sure I'd recognize your face 
And I know for sure I'd recognize your face.

THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS

 [Traditional version] 
On the (first) day of Christmas my true love sent to me 
Twelve lords leaping, Eleven ladies dancing, Ten pipers piping 
Nine drummers drumming, Eight maids milking, Seven swans swimming 
Six geese laying, Five gold rings 
Four calling birds, Three french hens, Two turtle doves, 
And a partridge in a pear tree 
 
 
[Frank's version] 
On the (first) day of Christmas, we gave our loving dad (my children gave to me) 
Twelve dozen kisses, Eleven jars of jelly, Ten silken hankies, 
Nine games of scrabble, Eight pairs of cufflinks, Seven books of fiction, 
Six golden lighters, Five ivory combs, 
Four mission lights, Three golf clubs, Two silken scarfs, 
And a most lovely lavender tie.

THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU

 The very thought of you and I forget to do 
The ordinary things that everyone ought to do. 
I'm living in a kind of daydream, I'm happy as a king, 
Foolish though it may seem, to me that's everything. 
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you, 
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you. 
I see you face in every flower, your eyes in stars above, 
It's just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love.

THE WORLD WE KNEW (OVER AND OVER)

 Over and over I keep going over the world we knew 
Once when you walked beside me 
That inconceivable, that unbelievable world we knew 
When we two were in love 
 
And every bright neon sign turned into stars 
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours 
Each road that we took turned into gold 
But the dream was too much for you to hold 
 
Now over and over I keep going over the world we knew 
Days when you used to love me 
 
[instrumental last two lines of first verse] 
 
And every bright neon sign turned into stars 
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours 
Each road that we took, it turned into gold 
But the dream was too much for you to hold 
 
Now over and over I keep going over the world we knew 
Days when you used to love me 
 
Over and over I keep going over the world we knew

THEME FROM NEW YORK, NEW YORK

 Start spreadin' the news, I'm leavin' today 
I want to be a part of it 
New York, New York 
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray 
Right through the very heart of it 
New York, New York 
 
I want to wake up, in a city that never sleeps 
And find I'm king of the hill 
Top of the heap 
 
These little town blues, are melting away 
I'll make a brand new start of it 
In old New York 
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere 
It's up to you, New York..New York 
 
New York...New York 
I want to wake up, in a city that never sleeps 
And find I'm A number one, top of the list 
King of the hill, A number one.... 
 
These little town blues, are melting away 
I'll make a brand new start of it 
In old New York 
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere 
It's up to you, New York..New York New York!!!

THEN SUDDENLY LOVE

 I never caught stardust that fell from the skies. 
I never saw moonlight in anyone's eyes, 
Then suddenly love kicks in the window, 
Love knocks down the door. 
Love, it sat down and told me, 
Lover, what are you waiting for? 
I never heard bluebirds, the songs that they sing, 
I never get crazy, not even in spring, 
Then suddenly love struck me like lightning, 
Love it blew up a storm, 
Love suddenly grabbed me, and ooh, was it cozy and warm 
'Cause I found you, now I no longer just exist, 
Ooh, what a change, it started from the time we kissed, 
(And now we hear bluebirds), they hear bluebirds, 
(We're learning that tune) they like that tune, 
(And even yon moonlight) all that pretty moonlight 
 
(Comes down about you) Hotdog, them love, it's still on a heaven, 
Love, it gave me a shove, 
[Ding dong Ding], I'm a hearing those [church bells ring] 
'Cause suddenly [love, love, love, love, love. love, love]

 

FRANK SINATRA
THERE ARE SUCH THINGS

 A heart that's true, there are such things 
A dream for two, there are such things 
Someone to whisper Darling you're my guiding star 
Not caring what you own but just what you are 
 
A peaceful sky, there are such things 
A rainbow high where heaven sings 
So have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings 
You'll reach a star because there are such things 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
So have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings 
You'lll reach a star because there are such things

THERE USED TO BE A BALLPARK

 And there used to be a ballpark where the field was warm and green 
And the people played their crazy game with a joy I'd never seen 
And the air was such a wonder from the hot dogs and the beer 
Yes, there used a ballpark right here 
 
And there used to be rock candy and a great big Fourth of July 
With the fireworks exploding all across the summer sky 
And the people watched in wonder, how they'd laugh and how they'd cheer 
And there used to be a ballpark right here 
 
Now the children try to find it 
And they can't believe their eyes 
 cause the old team just isn't playing 
And the new team hardly tries 
 
And the sky has got so cloudy 
When it used to be so clear 
And the summer went so quickly this year 
 
Yes, there used to be a ballpark right here

 

FRANK SINATRA
THEY ALL LAUGHED

 The odds were a hundred to one against me 
The world thought the heights were too high to climb 
But people from Missouri never incensed me 
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned 
For from hist'ry I had learned 
How many, many times the worm had turned 
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said the world was round 
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound 
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother when they said that man could fly 
They told Marconi wireless was a phony, it's the same old cry 
They laughed at me wanting you, said I was reaching for the moon 
But oh, you came through, now they'll have to change their tune 
They all said we never could be happy, they laughed at us and how! 
But ho, ho, ho! Who's got the last laugh now? 
They all laughed at Rockefeller Center, now they're fighting to get in 
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin 
They all laughed Fulton and his steamboat, Hershey and his chocolate bar 
Ford and his Lizzie, kept the laughers busy, that's how people are 
They laughed at me wanting you, said it would be, Hello, Goodbye. 
But oh, you came through, now they're eating humble pie 
They all said we'd never get together, darling, let's take a bow 
For ho, ho, ho! Who's got the last laugh? 
Hee, hee, hee! Let's at the past laugh, Ha, ha, ha! Who's got the last laugh now?

THEY CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME

 There are many, many crazy things 
That will keep me loving you, 
And with your permission 
May I list a few? 
 
The way you wear your hat. 
The way you sip your tea. 
The memory of all that 
No, no they can't take that away from me. 
 
The way your smile just beams. 
The way you sing off key. 
The way you haunt my dreams. 
No, no they can't take that away from me. 
 
We may never, never meet again 
On that bumpy road to love 
Still I'll always, 
Always keep the memory of: 
 
The way you hold your knife (do do do do do do). 
The way we danced until three. 
The way you've changed my life. 
No, no they can't take that away from me. 
No, they can't take that away from me.

THIS HAPPY MADNESS (ESTRADA BRANCA)

 What should I call this happy madness that I feel inside of me 
Sometime of wild October gladness that I never thought I'd see 
What has become of all my sadness all my endless lonely sighs 
Where are my sorrows now 
What happened to the frown and is that self contented clown 
Standing grinning in the mirror really me 
I'd like to run through Central Park carve your initials in the bark 
Of every tree I pass for every one to see 
I feel that I've gone back to childhood and I'm skipping through the wildwood 
So excited that I don't know what to do 
What do I care if I'm a juvenile I smile my secret little smile 
Because I know the change in me is you 
What should I call this happy madness all this unexpected joy 
That turned the world into a baby's bouncing toy 
The god's are laughing far above one of them gave a little shove 
And I fell gaily gladly madly into love

 

FRANK SINATRA
THIS IS ALL I ASK

 As I approach the prime of my life, I find I have the time of my life 
Learning to enjoy at my leisure all the simple pleasures 
And so I happily concede 
That this is all I ask, this is all I need 
 
Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me 
Lingering sunsets, stay a little longer with the lonely sea 
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me 
Take me to that strange, enchanted land grown ups seldom understand 
 
Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own 
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true before the night has flown 
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing 
Then I will stay younger than Spring

 

FRANK SINATRA
THIS IS MY LOVE

 Soft as a raindrop 
Fresh as the sea 
Warm as the sunshine 
Shining on me 
This is my love 
This is my love 
Light was her laughter 
Few were her tears 
Gentle her beauty 
Tender her years 
This is my love 
This is my love 
So young 
So fair 
Such bright golden hair 
A smile always on her face 
No other love 
Can ever compare 
No other can take her place 
Others may cherish 
Fortune or fame 
I will forever 
Cherish her name 
For this is my love 
This is my love

 

FRANK SINATRA
THIS IS MY SONG

 Love, this is my song, this is my song, my serenade to you 
The world cannot be wrong, if in this world there is you 
I care not what the world may say, without your love there is no day 
So love, this is my song, this is my song, my serenade to you 
I care not what the world may say, without your love there is no day 
So love, this is my song, this is my song, my serenade to you

 

FRANK SINATRA
THIS NEARLY WAS MINE

 One dream in my heart, one love to be living for, 
One love to be living for, this nearly was mine. 
One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise, 
This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine. 
Close to my heart she came, only to fly away, 
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight. 
Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise, 
Still saying that paradise once nearly was mine.

THIS TOWN

 This town is a lonely town 
Not the only town like a this town 
This town is a make you town 
Or a break you town and bring you down town 
 
This town is a quiet town 
Or a riot town like this town 
This town is a love you town 
And a shove you down and push you 'round town 
 
[instrumental] 
 
This town is an all right town 
For an uptight town like a this town 
This town, it's a use you town 
An abuse you town until you're down town 
 
This town is a losin' town 
It's a miserable town 
It's a nowhere town 
And I am leavin' this town 
You better believe that I'm leavin' this town 
Man, it could never be uptown 
It's bound to be downtown 
 
[Fade] 
 
This town, bye bye 
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye bye

THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN

 Three coins in the fountain, 
Each one seeking happiness. 
Thrown by three hopeful lovers, 
Which one will the fountain bless? 
 
Three hearts in the fountain, 
Each heart longing for its home. 
There they lie in the fountain 
Somewhere in the heart of Rome. 
 
Which one will the fountain bless? 
Which one will the fountain bless? 
 
Three coins in the fountain, 
Through the ripples how they shine. 
Just one wish will be granted, 
One heart will wear a valentine. 
 
Make it mine! 
Make it mine! 
Make it mine! 
 
[Musical interlude]

TIE A YELLOW RIBBON AROUND THE OLE OAK TREE

 I'm coming home I've done my time, 
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine, 
If you receive my letter tellin' you I'd soon be free, 
Then you'll know just what to do, if you still want me, if you still want me. 
Tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree, 
It's been three long years, do ya still want me? 
If I don't see a ribbon ,round the ole oak tree, 
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me 
If I don't see a ribbon round the ole oak tree. 
Bus driver, please look for me cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see, 
I'm really still in prison, and my love, she holds the key, 
Simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free. 
I wrote and told her please tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree, 
It's been three long years, do ya still want me? 
If I don't see a ribbon round the ole oak tree, 
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me, 
If I don't see a ribbon round the ole oak tree. 
Now the whole damn bus is cheering and I can't believe I see 
A hundred yellow ribbons round the ole oak tree.

TINA

 You simply can't forget her 
The moment you have met her, your heart will never ever be the same 
Tina, Tina, nobody else but Tina, that's the little lady's name 
 
And once you've gone and kissed her 
Give up, you can't resist her, your thoughts will wear her picture like a frame 
Tina, Tina, nobody quite like Tina, that's the little lady's name 
 
She'll merely smile, and in a twinkling 
You'll swear that smile contains a star 
Before that smile, you had no inkling 
How much in love you really are 
 
Let others look for angels 
I have no time for angels, I've found someone more than just divine 
Tina, Tina, no sir, you can't have Tina 
Tina is mine, all mine 
Tina is mine, all mine

TO LOVE A CHILD

 (feat. Nikki Costa) 
 
(chorus only) [Nikki Costa] 
 
(Lala lalalala, lala lalalala, lala lalalala, lalala.) 
 
 
 
 
As one human to another, I'd like to question you (what's the question?) 
If it takes the sun and the rain to make a tree grow, (that's a hard one) 
If it takes the moon and the tide to make the sea flow, 
What does it take to love a child? (to love a child) 
To love a child (to love a child) 
 
 
To love a child (to love a child), hmm, hmm, hmm (hmm, hmm, hmm) 
[Said the bigger to the smaller raccoon, do you need someone to move you,] 
[Said the smaller to the bigger raccoon, if you move I will follow.] 
(Up they went to climb a tree, they end the day most happily.) 
(Anything that they can do, humans can do too.) 
As one human to another, I'd like to question you. 
If it takes the sun and the rain to make the tree grow, (to make the tree grow) 
If it takes the moon and the tide to make the sea flow, (to make the sea flow) 
What does it take to love a child? (to love a child) 
To love a child (to love a child) 
 
 
To love a child (to love a child), to love a child (hmm, hmm, hmm) 
To love a child (lala, lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala, lala lalala)

TOGETHER

 She: We strolled the lane together, last out the rain together 
Sang love's refrain together, and we both pretend it would never end, 
One day we cry together, that's why we sigh together, 
You're gone from me but in my memory, we'll always be together. 
He: We strolled the lane together, baby, we last out that rain together, 
Sang love's refrain together, we knew long ago that our love would grow, 
She: Through sun and storm together, 
He: Our hearts as one together, 
You're gone from me, but in my memory, 
Both: We'll always be together.

TRISTE

 Sad is to live in solitude far from your tranquil altitude 
Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream 
That never can be, will never be dreamer awake, wake up and see. 
Your beauty is an aeroplane so high my heart can't bear the strain 
A heart that stops when you pass by, only to cause me pain 
Sad is to live in solitude

TWIN SOLILOQUIES (WONDER HOW IT FEELS)

 Frank duets with the girl [Girl singer] 
 
[Wonder how I feel living on a hill top,] 
[Looking on an ocean, beautiful and still,] 
This is what I need, this is what I've longed for, 
Someone young and smiling, climbing up my hill. 
[We are not alike, probably I'd bore him] 
[He's a cautious Frenchman, I'm a little hick] 
Younger men than I, officers and doctors, 
Probably pursue her, she could have her pick. 
[Wonder why I feel jittery and jumpy,] 
[I'm like a schoolgirl waiting before a dance] 
Can I ask her now, I am like a schoolboy, 
What will be her answer, do I have a chance?

UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG

 Don't you know I'd work for you, I'd slave for you, be a beggar or a knave for you 
If that isn't love it will have to do until the real thing comes along 
Gladly move the earth for you, prove my love dear, and it's worth for you 
If that isn't love it'll have to do, until the real thing comes along 
With all the words dear at my command, I just can't make you understand 
I'll always love you baby come what may, my heart is yours what more can I say 
I would cry for you, even sigh for you, tear those stars down from the sky for you 
If that isn't love it'll have to do, until the real thing comes along 
Walk on burning coals for you, I would drive the Chrysler, leave the Rolls for you 
If that ain't love it will have to do, until the real thing comes along 
I would try to hit high C for you, I'd even punch out Mr. T for you 
If that ain't love it will have to do, until the real thing comes along 
There's not a thing that you can't ask of me, go on, demand any task of me 
If you want the moon or a lavaliere, all you got to do is nibble on my ear 
I would rob, steal, beg, borrow, and lie for you, lay my little body down and die for you 
(If that ain't love if that isn't love), If that ain't love it will have to do 
Until the real thing comes along

WALK AWAY

 Walk away, please go before you throw your life away, 
A life I could share for just a day. 
We could have met some years ago. For your sake I'll say, 
Walk away, just go, walk away and live a life that's full with no regret. 
Don't look back to me, just try to forget. 
Why build a dream that cannot come true, so be strong, 
Reach the stars now, walk away, walk on. 
If I heard your voice, I'll beg you to stay, 
So don't say a word, just run away. 
Goodbye, my love, my tears will fall now that you're gone, 
I can't help but cry but I must go on. 
I'm sad that after searching so long, 
Knew I love you but told you, walk away, walk on.

 

FRANK SINATRA
WANDERING

 Sometimes I think that I'm on the right track, 
But I keep coming back to the same place, 
The same place where I sought it. 
Sometimes you'll think there's a smile on my face, 
But it can't take the place of a free heart, a me heart that I've read of. 
I can hear mem'ries singing through night and through day, 
What good are mem'ries, they just seem to get in the way. 
They get in the way. 
When it's November, I'll think of July, 
Where the sunshine will fly through a warm sky, 
A warm sky where I'll wander. 
When it's November, I'll think of July, 
Where the sunshine will fly through a warm sky, 
A warm sky where I'll wander.

WATCH WHAT HAPPENS

 Let someone start believing in you, let him hold out his hand 
Let him touch you and watch what happens 
One someone who can look in your eyes, and see into your heart 
Let him find you and watch what happens 
Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold 
Maybe just afraid to be broken again 
Let someone with a deep love to give 
Give that deep love to you, and what magic you'll see 
Let someone with a deep love to give 
Give that deep love to you. and what magic you'll see 
Let someone give his heart, someone who cares like me 
Let someone give his heart who cares like me

WATERTOWN

 Old Watertown, nothing much happenin', down on Main, 'cept a little rain 
Old Watertown, everyone knows, the perfect crime, killin' time 
And no one's goin' anywhere, livin's much too easy there 
It can never be a lonely place when there's the shelter of familiar faces 
Who can say it's not that way, Old Watertown, so much excitement 
To be found hangin' round, there's someone standing in the rain 
Waiting for the morning train, it's gonna be a lonely place 
Without the look of familiar faces, but who can say it's not that way

WAVE

 So close your eyes, for thats a lovely way to be 
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see 
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together 
You can't deny, don't try to fight the rising sea 
Don't fight the moon, the stars above and don't fight me 
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together 
When I saw you first the time was half past three, 
When your eyes met mine it was eternity 
By now we know the wave is on its way to be 
Just catch that wave don't be afraid of loving me 
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together 
When I saw you first the time was half past three 
When your eyes met mine it was eternity 
By now we know the wave is on its way to be 
Just catch that wave, don't be afraid of loving me 
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together

 A troupe of strolling players are we, not stars like L. B. Mayer's are we, 
But just a simple band who roams about the land, 
Dispensing plentyof frivolity. 
Mere folks who give distraction are we, yes, and give attraction are we, oh shut up, man 
But just a crazy group, that never seeks to sosoup, 
Around a pack of little on a leash. 
Well,. here we go, back to the home country again. 
We open in Venice, we next play Verona, then on to Cremona, 
Lots of laughs in Cremona, eh boys, our next jump in Parma, that dopy mopie menace, 
And Mantua and Padua, and then we open again. where? 
We open in Venice, we next play Verona, then on to Cremona, 
Lots of bars in Cremona, our next jump is Parma, that tearless fearless menace, 
And Mantua, and Padua, then we open again. Where? 
We open in Venice, we next play Verona, then on to Cremona, 
Lots of money in Cremona, our next jump in Parma, that's ingie pingie menace, 
Then Mantua, then Padua, and then we open again, where? 
We open in Venice, we next play Verona, then on to Cremona, 
Lots of players in Cremona, our next jump in Parma, that heartless artless menace, 
Then Mantua, then Padua, the we open again. Where? 
Oh, let me see now, I got a map, let's pick out someplace. 
Well just don't dicado back on the line now, oh let's take the first canyon out of here. 
As a matter fact if we hurry we can beat the sack, for the chef's out there waiting for us. 
Goodbye boys, gida, gida, gida.

And the happiest New Year. 
The happiest and the friendliest, and the merriest, the cheerfullest, 
And the happiest New Year.

WE'LL GATHER LILACS IN THE SPRING

 We'll gather lilacs in the spring again, 
And walk together down an endless lane, 
Until our hearts have learned to sing again, 
When you come home once more. 
And in the evening by the firelight glow, 
You'll hold me close and never let me go, 
Your eyes will tell me all I want to know, 
When you come home once more. 
[musical interlude] 
And in the evening by the firelight glow, 
You'll hold me close and never let me go, 
Your eyes will tell me all I want to know,

WE'LL MEET AGAIN

 We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when, 
Bit I know we'll meet again some sunny day. 
Keep smiling through just like you always do, 
Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away. 
So will you please say hello to the folks that I know, tell them I won't be long. 
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go, I was singing this song. 
We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when, 
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.

WHAT A FUNNY GIRL (YOU USED TO BE)

 You always looked a little out of place, all grown up with freckles on your face 
We'd spend each night with company, just you, the teddy bear, the dolls and me 
What a funny girl you used to be, you always had a thousand things to do 
Getting all involved with something new, always some new recipe the kitchen 
Always looked like World War Three, what a funny girl you used to be 
It was so good with you around, you always found a smile 
Where smiles could not be found, I never ever met a person more sincere 
You'd always listen with an open ear, you'd fall for lines so easily 
Whatever they were selling you'd buy three 
What a funny girl you used to be, what a funny girl you used to be...

 

FRANK SINATRA
WHAT NOW MY LOVE

 What now my love, now that you've left me, how can I live through another day 
Watching my dreams turn to ashes, and my hopes turn to bits of clay 
Once I could see, once I could feel, now I am numb, I've become unreal 
I walk the night, without a goal, stripped of my heart and my soul 
What now my love, now that it's over, I feel the world falling all around me 
Here come the stars, tumbling around me, there's the sky, where that sea should be 
What now my love, now that you're gone, I'd be a fool to go on and on 
No one would care, no one would cry, if I should live if I should live or die 
What now my love, now there is nothing, only my last, my last good bye

 

FRANK SINATRA
WHAT'S NOW IS NOW

 You should've told me when it all began 
You should've told me long ago 
Someday I know you're gonna find 
Just one mistake is not enough to change my mind 
 
What's now is now and I'll forget what happened then 
I know it all and we can still begin again 
 
And if the doubting faces made you go 
It's only mine that matters now 
Those looks will soon begin to fade 
If you come back and show them all you're not afraid 
 
What's now is now and I'll forget what happened then 
I know it all and we can still begin again 
 
Now that you know how much I understand 
You have no reason to be gone 
And if you feel at all like me 
Just let me know, I'll make it like it used to be 
 
What's now is now and I'll forget what happened then 
I know it all and we can still begin again 
 
What's now is now and I'll forget what happened then 
I know it all

WHEN I LOST YOU

 [musical intro] 
I lost the sunshine and roses, I lost the heavens of blue, 
I lost the beautiful rainbow, I lost the morning dew. 
I lost the angel who gave me summer, the whole winter too. 
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness, 
When I lost you. 
 
[musical interlude] 
 
And I lost the angel who gave me summer, the whole winter too. 
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness, 
When I lost you.

WHEN I TAKE MY SUGAR TO TEA

 When I take my sugar to tea, all the boys are jealous of me, 
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes, 
When I take my sugar to tea. 
I'm a rowdy dowdy, that's me, she's a high hat baby, that's she, 
So I never take her where the gang goes, 
When I take my sugar to tea. 
Every Sunday afternoon, we forget about our cares, 
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz, with those millionaires. 
When I take my sugar to tea, I'm as ritzy as I can be, 
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes, 
When I take my sugar to tea. 
(musical interlude) 
 
Every Sunday afternoon, we forget about those cares, 
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz, with those zillionaires. 
When I take my sugar to tea, I'm as ritzy as I can be, 
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes, 
When I take, take my sugar to tea.

 

FRANK SINATRA
WHEN I'M NOT NEAR THE GIRL I LOVE

 Oh my heart is beating wildly and it's all because you're here. 
When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near. 
Every femme that flutters by me is a flame that must be fanned, 
When I can't fondle the hand I'm fond of, I fondle the hand at hand 
My heart's in a pickle, it's constantly fickle and not too partic'lar I fear, 
When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near. 
I'm confessing a confession and I hope I'm not verbose when I am not close 
To the kiss I cling to, I cling to the kiss that's close. 
As I'm more and more a mortal, I am more and more a case 
When I'm not facing the face I fancy, I fancy the face I face. 
For Sharon I'm caring but Susan I'm choosing, I'm faithful to those whos'n is here. 
When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near.

 

FRANK SINATRA
WHEN SOMEBODY LOVES YOU

 When somebody loves you, you feel it in your heart 
When somebody loves you, you know it from the start 
Every kiss becomes more than a kiss 
Each look, each touch they mean so much 
And that's when you discover how it feels to be a lover 
 
When somebody loves you, it shows in every smile 
When somebody loves you, your life becomes worthwhile 
Always caring, always sharing everything you do 
When somebody loves you like I love you 
 
(When somebody loves you, it shows in every smile) 
(When somebody loves you, your life becomes worthwhile) 
Always caring, always sharing everything you do 
When somebody loves you like I love you

WHEN THE WIND WAS GREEN

 When the wind was green at the start of the spring 
When the wind was green like a living thing 
It was on my lips and its kiss was fair 
You were there 
 
When the wind was red like a summer wine 
When the wind was red like your lips on mine 
It caressed my face and it tossed my hair 
You were there 
 
Then came the fall and all of love came tumbling, stumbling down 
Like leaves that lost to frost and found 
They were flying, crying 
In a brown wind dying 
 
But the winter's come and we both should know 
That the wind is white like the swirling snow 
And we'll never see all the wonderful things to be seen 
When the wind is green

WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL

 Oooh, Winchester Cathedral, you're bringin' me down 
You stood and you watched as my baby left town 
You coulda done somethin', hey, you didn't try 
You didn't do nothin', you just let her walk by 
 
Now everyone knows just how much I needed that girl 
She wouldn't have gone far away if only you'd started ringin' your bell 
 
Winchester Cathedral, you're bringin' me down 
You stood and you watched as my baby left town 
 
Hey, Winchester Cathedral, you are bringin' me down 
You stood and you watched as, you watched her go by, my baby left town 
You coulda done somethin', but you didn't even try 
You didn't do nothin', you didn't ding dong, you let her get by 
 
Now everyone knows just how much I needed that girl 
She wouldn't have gone far away, if only you'd started ringin' your bell 
 
Now, Winchester Cathedral, man, you've brought me down 
You just stood there and watched as my baby left town!

WINNERS

 Here's to the winners lift up the glasses . 
Here's to the glory still to be. 
Here's to the battle, whatever it's for, 
To ask the best of ourselves, then give much more. 
 
Here's to the heroes those who move mountains. 
Here's to the miracles they make us see. 
Here's to all brothers here's to all people 
Here's to the winners all of us can be.

WITCHCRAFT

 Those fingers in my hair 
That sly come hither stare 
That strips my conscience bare 
It's witchcraft 
 
And I've got no defense for it 
The heat is too intense for it 
What good would common sense for it do? 
 
'cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft 
And although I know it's strictly taboo 
When you arouse the need in me 
My heart says Yes, indeed in me 
 Proceed with what you're leadin' me to 
 
It's such an ancient pitch 
But one I wouldn't switch 
'cause there's no nicer witch than you 
[instrumental] 
 
 
'cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft 
And although I know it's strictly taboo 
When you arouse the need in me 
My heart says Yes, indeed in me 
 Proceed with what you're leadin' me to 
 
It's such an ancient pitch 
But one I'd never switch 
'cause there's no nicer witch than you

WITHOUT A SONG

 Without a song the day would never end 
Without a song the road would never bend 
When things go wrong a man ain't got a friend 
Without a song 
 
That field of corn would never see a plow 
That field of corn would be deserted now 
A man is born but he's no good no how 
Without a song 
 
I got my trouble and woe but, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll 
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul 
 
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall 
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall 
I only know there ain't no love at all 
Without a song 
 
[instrumental] 
 
I've a got my trouble and woe and, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll

WIVES AND LOVERS

 Hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your make up, soon he will open the door, 
Don't think because there's a ring on your finger, you needn't try any more. 
For wives should always be lovers too, 
Run to his arms the moment that he comes home to you. 
I'm warning you, 
Day after day, there are girls at the office and the men will always be men, 
Don't stand him up, with your hair still in curlers, you may not see him again. 
Wives should always be lovers too, 
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you. 
He's almost here, hey, little girl, better wear something pretty, 
Something you wear to go to the city, 
Dim all the lights, pour the wine, start the music, time to get ready for love. 
Time to get ready for love, yes it's time to get ready for love, 
It's time to get ready, kick your shoes off, baby....,

 

FRANK SINATRA
WORLD WAR NONE!

 Where I live in the desert, it's so peaceful and warm. 
And the cares of the world drift by, like clouds reflected in a quiet pool 
But there always comes a time, when a man has to think of the future, 
(War, war, war!) Has to think of his children, (war, war, war!) 
And the world they will live in (war, war, war, war!), 
I'm not sure if I can do anything to help them, but I can try, I can try. 
Time to build us a fire, seven hundred feet high, 
We can fashion a fire (fire) that will reach the sky (reach the sky) 
We can feed the flames with the unkind deeds we've done (with the fire), 
'Cause we've got to get ready, for World War None. 
(What we want is to burn our sins in a sort of furnace,) 
(We'll be stoking the fire with the lies we know) 
All our false suspicions we can burn them one by one 
That will help us get ready for World War None. 
(A little love is more effective than a rifle,) 
(A little faith will take you farther than it can) 
(The rule we follow is the one forever spoken) 
(They haven't got the truth on their lips). 
Keep on feeding the fire, till the fire is hot, 
With those un neighborly feelings we deny we've got. 
Keep on trying for peace, until that peace is won. 
Then you're practically ready for World War None. 
(A whispered word or touch is louder than a bugle) 
(A silent prayer is so much stronger than a sword,) 
(And the bombs that can't replace the stained glass window) 
For which we should thank the good Lord, thank the good Lord) 
(Thank you, thank you, thank you) 
If we cherish our fire (if we cherish our fire) 
It could possibly be (it could possibly be), 
Bright enough to be seen, (bright enough to be seen) 
Far across the sea (far across the sea), 
When those other countries (when those other countries) 
what we have done (what we've done) 
Maybe they'll help us get ready (get ready, get ready) 
 
(World War None!)

YELLOW DAYS

 I remember when the sunlight had a special kind of brightness 
And laughter held a lover's kind of lightness, Yellow days, yellow days. 
She would hold me and the smile would spread around us so completely 
And the softness of a kiss would linger sweetly, Yellow days, yellow days. 
But then came thunder and I heard her say goodbye 
Through tears of wonder, Now I'm alone and my heart wants to know 
Yellow days, where'd you go? 
Life is empty and the sunlight seems so harsh instead of tender 
And the laughter's just an echo I'll remember Yellow days, yellow days. 
Now I'm alone and my heart wants to know 
Yellow days, where'd you go? 
Life is empty and the sunlight seems so harsh instead of tender 
And the laughter's just an echo I'll remember Yellow days, yellow days

YES SIR, THAT'S MY BABY

 [first words replaced by trumpet notes], ***, that's my baby 
No sir, I don't mean maybe, yes sir, that's my baby now 
Yes, ma'm, we've decided, no ma'm, we ain't gonna hide it, yes, ma'm, you're invited now 
By the way, by the way, when we walk up to the preacher I'll say 
Yes sir, that's my baby, no sir, I don't mean maybe 
Yes sir, that's my baby now, [instrumental interlude] 
By the way, by the way, when we run into the preacher I'll say 
I'll say yes sir, that's my baby, no sir, I don't mean maybe 
Yes sir, that's my baby now, Mmm

YESTERDAY

 Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away 
Now they look as though they're here to stay, 
Oh I believe in yesterday, oh I believe in yesterday. 
 
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be. 
There's a shadow hanging over me, oh yesterday came suddenly. 
Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say. 
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday. 
 
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play, 
Now I need a place to hide away, oh I believe in yesterday. 
Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say. 
I said something wrong , now I long for yesterday. 
 
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play, 
Now I need a place to hide away, oh I believe in yesterday

YESTERDAYS

 Yesterdays, Yesterdays, days I knew as happy sweet sequestered days 
Olden days, golden days, days of mad romance and love 
Then gay youth was mine, and truth was mine 
Joyous free and flaming life forsooth was mine 
Sad am I, glad am I, for today I'm dreaming of, of yesterdays 
Then gay youth was mine, the truth was mine 
Sad am I, glad am I, for today I'm dreaming of, of yesterdays

YOU AND ME (WE WANTED IT ALL)

 [intro strings] 
 
You and me, we wanted it all we wanted it all 
Passion without pain, sunshine without rainy days 
We wanted it always 
 
You and me, we reached for the sky, the limit was high 
Never giving in, certain we could win that prize 
I should have seen it in your eyes 
 
Look how all our dreams came true 
See how I've got me and, baby, you've got you 
Through it all, just one thing died 
A little thing called love, something deep inside 
 
You and me, we're not like the rest, we once were the best 
Back when we were dumb, how did we become so smart 
And learn to break each other's heart? 
 
Look how all our dreams came true 
See how I've got me, baby, you've got you 
Through it all, just one thing died 
A little thing called love, something deep inside 
 
You and me, we're not like the rest, we once were the best 
But look what we became, isn't it a cryin' shame 
That we almost made it? 
 
But we wanted it all 
Baby, you and me 
We wanted it all 
 
Mm., mm , mm

YOU AND THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC

 You and the night and the music fill me with flaming desire, 
Setting my being completely on fire! 
You and the night and the music thrill me but will we be one 
After the night and the music are done? 
Until the pale light of dawning and daylight, our hearts will be throbbing guitars, 
Morning may come without warning, and take away the stars. 
If we must live for the moment, love till the moment is through! 
After the night and the music die, will I have you?

 

FRANK SINATRA
YOU ARE THE SUNSHINE OF MY LIFE

 You are the sunshine of my life, that's why I'll always be around 
You are the apple of my eye, forever you'll stay (be) in my heart 
I know that this is the beginning, Though I loved you for one million years 
But if I thought our love was ending, I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 
You are the sunshine of my life 
That's why I'll always be around, you are the apple of my eye 
Forever you'll stay (be) in my heart 
You must have known that I was lonely, because you came to my rescue 
And though I know that this is heaven, how could so much love be inside of you 
You are the sunshine of my life, that's why I'll always be around 
You are the apple of my eye, forever you'll stay (be) in my heart 
('Cause you are) You are the sunshine of my life 
(Of my life, of my life) (Light my fire baby, light my fire,...)

 

FRANK SINATRA
YOU ARE THERE

 You are there, in autumn gold or summer green, 
You are there, to lend enchantment to the scene. 
I hear music, and all because you are there. 
In a mist, behind a window in the dawn, 
We have kissed, but when I reached for you, you'd gone... 
You come and you go, like April snow, 
Until I wonder, darling, are you real, or an illusion I embrace 
Half a dream, the other half that laughing face 
Although, in my heart, I know that you are there 
You are there, You are there!

 

FRANK SINATRA
YOU BROUGHT A NEW KIND OF LOVE TO ME

 If the nightingales could sing like you 
They'd sing much sweeter than they do 
For you brought a new kind of love to me 
 
And if the sandman brought me dreams of you 
I'd want to sleep my whole life through 
You brought a new love to me 
 
I know that I'm the slave, you're the queen 
Still you can understand that underneath it all 
You're a maid and I am only a man 
 
I would work and slave the whole day through 
If I could hurry home to you 
You brought a new kind of love to me

 

FRANK SINATRA
YOU NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD

 The life and land around you is good, so good, so good. 
You never had it so good, you never had it so good, 
You never had it so good, you never had it so good, 
You never had it so good, sister, 
Smiles of happy faces, different styles and races, 
Still we're one big neighborhood. 
You never, I mean never, ever had it so good, so good, so good, so good. 
Ice cream on your apple pie, that's good, that's good. 
Mountain streams of fish fry, yum yum, that's good. 
Flag that you can wave about, that's good, that's good. 
A wide spread you can see right outside good, that's good. 
What our forefathers said still goes, any American knows, 
You never had it so good, you never had it so good, 
You never had it so good, you never had it so good, 
You never had it so good, sister, 
Smiles of happy faces, different styles and races, 
Still we're one big neighborhood. 
You never, I mean never, ever had it so good, so good, so good, so good. 
The corn upon the splendid plain, that's good, that's good. 
And frozen foods in cellophane, that's good, that's good, 
A hot dog in a bleacher's seat, that's good, that's good, 
A town hall where the people meet, that's good, that's good. 
Old John Hancock, he said it fine, he put it right on the line, 
You never had it so good, you never had it so good, 
You never had it so good, you never had it so good, 
You never had it so good, sister, 
Smiles of happy faces, different styles and races, 
Still we're one big neighborhood. 
You never, I mean never, ever had it so good, so good, so good, so good. 
Not ever!

YOU TURNED MY WORLD AROUND

 Walkin' lonely streets, lookin' for a sign 
Livin' lonely dreams, life with no design 
Like lonely people do, livin' in the past 
Only findin' love that didn't last 
Then the shadows of my life felt the sun and saw your face 
As your love fell all around me making perfect time and space 
 
Then you turned my world around 
When you held out your hand 
You turned my world around 
Bringin' love to a lonely man 
 
Now I walk with you, Spring has come at last 
No more lonely dreams, they're all in the past 
And each day knows the joy that sharing love can give 
Love's the only life that we can li ive 
Now the shadows of my life feel the sun, I see your face 
As your love falls all around me making perfect time and space 
 
And you turned my world around 
When you held out your hand 
You turned my world around 
Bringing love to a lonely man

YOU WILL BE MY MUSIC

 When all the songs are out of tune, 
And all the rhymes ring so untrue; 
When I don't find the words to say 
The thoughts I long to bring to you; 
When I hear lonely singers 
Who are just as lost as me 
Making noise, not melody: 
 
You will be my music. 
You will be song. 
You will be my music. 
I can't wait any longer if I'm wrong. 
 
I'll never find the song to tell me 
All the things I need to say. 
And I'm afraid as time goes by 
That someday soon you'll go away. 
And I'll be lost in trying 
For songs I'll never sing. 
Wanting you is everything: 
 
You will be my music. 
You will be song. 
You will be my music. 
I can't wait any longer if I'm wrong. 
I can't wait any longer for my song.

YOU'D BE SO EASY TO LOVE

 You'd be so easy to love 
So easy to idolize all others above 
So worth the yearning for 
So swell to keep every home fire burning for 
 
And we would be so grand at the game 
Carefree together that it does seem a shame 
That you can't see your future with me 
'cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love 
 
You'd be so easy to love 
Easy to idolize all others above 
So worth the yearning for 
So swell to keep all the home fires burning for 
 
We'd be so grand at the game 
So carefree together that it does seem a shame 
That you can't see your future with me 
'cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love 
 
Easy to love

YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE

 When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high, and don't be afraid of the dark. 
At the end of the storm, is the golden sky, and the sweet silver song of the lark. 
Walk on through the wind, walk on through the rain, 
Though your dreams be tossed and blown, 
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart, 
And you'll never walk alone, you'll never walk alone.

YOU'RE A LUCKY FELLOW, MR. SMITH

 (Now, see here, Mr. Smith or whatever your name may be.) 
(You seem like a pretty nice guy, so I would like you to listen to me,) 
(I don't want to butt into your business but I heard you complaining a lot,) 
(Of a louse of a luck you have, and the good luck that others have got,) 
(I say you're a little bit crazy, you have plenty of luck, my friend,) 
(I think you should open your eyes, and discover your country again.) 
 
Hey, you're a lucky fellow, Mr. Smith (Mr. Smith) to be able to live as you do, 
And to have that swell Miss Liberty gal carrying the torch for you. 
(You're a lucky fellow. Mr. Smith), look around you if you want to brag, 
You should thank your lucky stars and I mean, thank all 50 in your flag. 
(And you really got a family tree) with Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Lee, 
(You're lucky to have ancestors like that), 
you were born with a feather in your hat. 
(You're a very very wealthy gent), I don't care if you haven't cent. 
You can still have things your own way, on each election day. 
If some poor suckers could choose, they like to be in your shoes, 
, 
 
 
You are a lucky fellow, Mr. Smith (Mr.Smith), to be able to swing like you do, 
And to have that swell Miss Liberty gal carrying the torch for you 
(You're a lucky fellow, Mr. Smith), look around you if you like to brag 
You should thank your lucky stars and I mean, there are 50 in your flag. 
(For you're rolling in a lot of wealth), your speech is free, yes siree, you got your health. 
(So we got our health and tell me, why not?), 
You should look at the great constitution that we got. 
(You're a very very wealthy gent), I don't care if you haven't a cent. 
You can still have things your own way, on each election day. 
You're blushing red, white and blue, but buddy, that's alright too, 
 
You're a fortunate fellow, (yes, a fortunate fellow), 
And a privileged person (and a privileged person),

YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY!

 You, you're driving me crazy! What did I do? What did I do? 
My tears for you make everything hazy, clouding the skies of blue 
How true, were the friends who were near me to cheer me 
Believe, me they knew, but you 
Were the kind who would hurt me, desert me 
When I needed you 
Yes you, you're driving me crazy! What did I do to you?

 

FRANK SINATRA
YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM ME

 Move over, sun, and give me some sky 
I got me some wings I'm eager to try 
I may be unknown but wait till I've flown 
You're gonna hear from me 
 
Make me some room, you people up there 
On top of the world, I'll meet you, I swear 
I'm stakin' my claim, so remember my name 
You're gonna hear from me 
 
BRIDGE: 
Fortune, smile on the road before me 
I am fortune's child 
Listen, world, you can't ignore me 
 
I've got a song that longs to be played 
Raise up my flag, begin my parade 
Then watch the world over start comin' up Clover 
That's how it's gonna be 
 
[Instrumental bridge]

YOU'RE NOBODY 'TIL SOMEBODY LOVES YOU

 You're a nobody till somebody loves you 
You're nobody till somebody cares 
You may be king, you may possess the world and its gold 
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growin' old 
 
The world still is the same, you'll never change it 
As sure as the stars shine above 
You're nobody till somebody loves you 
Find yourself somebody to love 
 
[very brief instrumental] 
 
You're a nobody till somebody loves you 
You're nobody till somebody cares 
You may be a king, you may possess the whole world and its gold 
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're gettin' old 
 
The world still is the same, you'll never change it 
As sure as the stars shine above 
You're nobody, nobody till somebody loves you 
So find yourself somebody 
 
[bridge] 
Gotta get yourself somebody 
 
Because you're nobody till somebody loves you 
You're nobody till somebody cares 
You may a king, you might possess the big fat world and its gold 
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growin' old 
 
The world, the whole world's the same, you'll never change it change it 
As sure as the stars shine above 
You're a nobody till somebody loves you 
So find yourself somebody somebody to love

YOU'RE SO RIGHT (FOR WHAT'S WRONG IN MY LIFE)

 You're so right for what's wrong in my life. 
You're as right as rain; how can I explain? 
You just fill every void in my life. 
Oh, so right for what's wrong. 
 
Fingers reaching; searching for the touch 
Of love's first meeting. Something tells me that 
You're right for what's wrong in my life. 
You're as right as rain; how can I explain? 
You just fill all the need in my heart. 
Oh, so right for what's wrong. 
 
You've changed my world into a Shangri La. 
Without a single word, I knew that you 
Would right every wrong in my life. 
Through the darkness of night, 
You're my one shining light. 
You're so right for what's wrong.

YOUNG AT HEART

 Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you 
If you're young at heart. 
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind 
If you're young at heart. 
 
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes. 
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams. 
And life gets more exciting with each passing day. 
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way. 
 
Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth 
To be young at heart. 
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far 
To be young at heart. 
 
And if you should survive to 105, 
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive! 
And here is the best part, you have a head start 
If you are among the very young at heart. 
 
[Musical interlude] 
 
And if you should survive to 105, 
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive! 
And here is the best part, you have a head start 
If you are among the very young at heart.

YOUNGER THAN SPRINGTIME

 Younger than springtime are you, softer than starlight are you, 
Warmer than winds of June are the gentle lips you gave me. 
Gayer than laughter are you, sweeter than music are you, 
Angel and lover, heaven and earth are you to give me. 
And when your youth and joy invade my soul, 
And fill my heart as now they do, then 
Younger than springtime am I, gayer than laughter am I, 
Angel and lover, heaven and earth am I with you.

ZING! WENT THE STRINGS OF MY HEART

 [Intro] 
Never could carry a tune, never knew where to start 
You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart 
 
 
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody 
It haunted me from the start 
Something inside of me started a symphony 
Zing! Went the strings of my heart 
 
'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing 
About a nest set apart 
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony 
Zing! Went the strings of my heart 
 
Your eyes made skies blue again 
What else could I do again 
Keep repeating through again 
 I love you, love you 
 
I still recall the thrill, guess I always will 
I hope 'twill never depart 
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony 
Zing! Went the strings of my heart 
 
[instrumental] 
 
Your eyes made skies blue again 
What else could I do again? 
Keep repeating through again 
 I love you, I do love you 
 
I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will 
I hope 'twill never depart 
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony 
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
