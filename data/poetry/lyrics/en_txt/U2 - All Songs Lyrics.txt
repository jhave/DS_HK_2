11 O'CLOCK TICK TOCK

 It's cold outside 
It gets so hot in here 
And the boys and girls collide 
To The music in my ear 
 
Hear the children crying 
And I know it's time to go 
I hear the children crying 
Take me home 
 
A painted face 
And I know we haven't long 
We thought that we had the answers 
It was the questions we had wrong 
 
Hear the children crying 
And I know it's time to go 
I hear the children crying 
Take me home 
 
Say so, say so 
Say so, say so 
 
La lah la lah...La lah la lah...La lah lah... 
[Repeat four times] 
 
Say so, say so 
Say so, say so 
 
Call out your name 
Call out each name 
Call out your name 
Call out 
You better call out 
Call, call, call out

  (From Psalm 40)
  
  I waited patiently for the Lord
  He inclined and heard my cry
  He brought me up out of the pit
  Out of the miry clay
  
  I will sing, sing a new song
  I will sing, sing a new song
  
  How long to sing this song?
  How long to sing this song?
  How long...how long...how long...
  How long...to sing this song
  
  He set my feet upon a rock
  And made my footsteps firm
  Many will see
  Many will see and fear
  
  I will sing, sing a new song
  I will sing, sing a new song
  I will sing, sing a new song
  I will sing, sing a new song
  
  How long to sing this song?

  I will sing a new song,
  How long to sing this song?
  He set my feet upon a rock,
  and made my footsteps heard.
  Many will see,
  Many will see and fear.
  I will sing, sing a new song.
  How long to sing this song?

A CELEBRATION

 Shake! Shake! 
 
 
Don't go 
I believe in a celebration 
I believe you set me free 
I believe you can loose this chains 
I believe you can dance with me 
Dance with me 
 
 
Shake! Shake! 
Shake! Shake! 
 
 
I believe in the third world war 
I believe in the atomic bomb 
I believe in the powers that be 
But they won't overpower me 
 
 
And, and you can go there too 
And, and you can go go go go 
 
 
Shake! Shake! 
Shake! Shake! 
 
 
And we dance out of time 
And everything goes 'round and 'round 
And we don't have the time 
To watch the world go tumbling down 
 
 
Go! Go! 
 
 
I believe in the bells of Christchurch 
Ringing for this land 
I believe in the cells of Mountjoy 
There's an honest man 
 
 
And, and you can go there too 
And, and you can go go go go 
 
 
I believe in the walls of Jericho 
I believe they're coming down 
I belive in this city's children 
I believe the trumpet's sound 
 
 
(And you...) 
(Can go there too) 
(And you...) 
(can go go go go) 
 
 
And you can go there too 
And you can go go go go...

A DAY WITHOUT ME

 Starting a landslide in my ego 
Look from the outside 
To the world I left behind 
 
I'm dreaming 
You're awake 
If I were sleeping 
What's at stake 
 
A day without me 
 
Whatever the feelings 
I keep feeling 
What are the feelings 
You left behind 
 
Today's a day without me 
 
I started a landslide in my ego 
Look from the outside 
To the world I left behind 
 
In the world I left behind 
Wipe their eyes, and then let go 
To the world I left behind 
Shed a tear, and then let go

A ROOM AT THE HEARTBREAK HOTEL

 From where I stand 
I can see thrugh you 
From where you're sitting, pretty one 
I know it got to you 
 
 
I see the stars in your eyes 
You want the truth, but you need the lies 
Like Judy Garland, like Valentino 
You give your life for rock n' roll 
Uh huh 
 
 
Stand, we're on a landslide of love 
You got everything you want 
But what you need you give away 
 
 
For primitive love 
And a ride on the mystery train 
A primitive love 
A room at the Heart... 
The Heartbreak Hotel 
A room at the Heartbreak 
Heartbreak Hotel 
A room at theHeartbreak 
Heartbreak Hotel 
 
 
You say it's love, it's not the money 
You let them suck your life out like honey 
Turning tricks, you're on the street 
Selling your kisses so bittersweet 
 
 
(Gospel voices) 
 
 
A primitive love 
A and a ride on the mystery train 
A primitive love 
A room at the Heart 
The Heartbreak Hotel 
 
 
A room at the Heartbreak, the Heartbreak, 
The Heartbreak Hotel, Hotel

A SORT OF HOMECOMING


  
  And you know it's time to go
  through the sleet and driving snow
  across the fields of mourning to
  lights in the distance
  
  And you hunger for the time
  Time to heal, 'Desire', time
  And you earth moves beneath
  Your own dream landscape
  
  Oh, oh on borderland we run
  And still we run, we run and don't look back
  I'll be there, I'll be there
  Tonight, a highroad, a highroad out of here
  
  The city walls are all come down
  The dust a smoke screen all around to see
  Faces ploughed like fields that once
  Gave no resistance
  
  And we live by the side of the road
  On the side of a hill as the valleys explode
  Dislocated, suffocated
  The land grows weary of it's own
  
  Oh, oh on borderland we run
  And still we run, we run and don't look back
  Tonight, tonight
  
  The wind will crack in wintertime
  A bomb blast lightning waltz
  No spoken words, just a scream . . .
  
  Tonight we'll a bridge across the sea and land
  See the sky burning rain
  She will die and live again
  Tonight
  
  And you heart beats so slow
  Through the rain and fallen snow
  Across the fields of morning
  To a light that's in the distance
  Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep
  For tonight, at last
  I am coming home
  I am coming home

ACROBAT

 Don't believe what you hear 
Don't believe what you see 
If you just close your eyes 
You can feel the enemy 
When I first met you girl 
You had fire in your soul 
What happened your face of melting in snow? 
Now it looks like this 
 
And you can swallow 
Or you can spit 
You can throw it up 
Or choke on it 
And you can dream 
So dream out loud 
You know that your time is coming 'round 
So don't let the bastards grind you down 
 
No, nothing makes sense 
Nothing seems to fit 
I know you'd hit out 
If you only knew who to hit 
And I'd join the movement 
If there was one I could believe in 
Yeah I'd break bread and wine 
If there was a church I could receive in 
'Cause I need it now 
 
To take the cup 
To fill it up 
To drink it slow 
I can't let you go 
I must be an acrobat 
To talk like this 
And act like that 
And you can dream 
So dream out loud 
And don't let the bastards grind you down 
 
Oh, it hurts baby 
What are we going to do? Now it's all been said 
No new ideas in the house and every book has been read 
 
And I must be an acrobat 
To talk like this 
And act like that 
And you can dream 
So dream out loud 
And you can find 
Your own way out 
And you can build 
And I can will 
And you can call 
I can't wait until 
You can stash 
And you can seize 
Responsibilities 
And I can love 
And I can love 
And I know that the tide is turning 'round 
So don't let the bastards grind you down

ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER

 There must be some way out of here, 
Said the joker to the thief. 
 There's too much confusion here, 
I can't get no relief. 
Businessmen they drink my wine 
Plowmen dig my earth 
None of them know along the line 
What any of this is worth 
Yeah... 
 
 No reason to get excited, 
The thief, he kindly spoke. 
 There are many here among us 
Who think that life is but a joke 
But you and I, we've been through that 
And that is not our fate 
So let us not talk falsely now 
Because the hour is getting late. 
 
All along the watchtower 
Princes kept the view 
While horsemen came and went 
Barefoot servants too 
 
All I got is a red guitar 
Three chords 
And the truth 
All I got is a red guitar 
The rest is up to you 
 
 There's no reason to get excited, 
The thief, he kindly spoke. 
 There are some among us here 
Say that life is just a joke 
You and I, we've been through that 
And that is not our fate (at least today) 
So let us not talk falsely now 
Because the hour is getting late 
Late...yeah...

Crack the bone, get to the marrow

What we've lost we don't need...Always 
What is it that won't let you sleep...Always 
 
Be the arrow 
And the target 
Put your head over the parapet 
Be uncool 
Yes, be awkward 
And don't look in the obvious place 
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate(???) 
 
Get down off your holy cloud...Always 
God will not deal with the proud...Always 
Well if you dream then dream out loud...Always 
Eternally yours...Always 
 
I want you 
I want you 
I want you 
 
Touching the other side 
I wanted to be in love(???) 
I wanted to call(???) 
 
You say come to know yourself...Always 
Don't find yourself in someone else...Always 
And always wear a safety belt...Always 
Wait for me I'm running late...Always 
This is the moment that we share...For always 
Turn each song into a prayer...Always 
 
Now and forever

I awoke with a feeling of never before

Dressed up like a lovely day, oh 
 
Babyface, babyface 
Slow down child, let me untie your lace 
Babyface, babyface 
Cover girl with natural grace 
How could beauty be so kind 
To an ordinary guy 
 
Coming home late at night 
To turn you on 
Checking out every frame 
I've got slow motion on my side 
Turning around and around 
With the sound and colour 
 
Under my control, go 
Round and around, going down 
Dressed up like a lovely day 
 
Babyface, babyface 
Tin foil hair all tied up in lace 
Babyface, babyface 
Bitter sweet girl won't you give me a taste 
How could beauty be so kind 
To an ordinary guy 
 
Do do do do do do do do do...do do... 
Do do do do do do do do do...do do... 
 
Babyface, babyface 
Slow down child, let me untie your lace 
Babyface, babyface 
Open the door, let me unpack my case 
Babyface, babyface 
You're everywhere child 
You're all over the place 
Babyface, babyface 
You're coming to me from outer space 
Hou could beauty be so kind 
To an ordinary guy

If you tear yourself in two again

If I could, I would 
Let it go 
Surrender... 
Dislocate...

Lifeless lifeline to the wind 
Leave this heart of clay 
See you walk, walk away 
Into the night 
And through the rain 
Into the half light 
And through the flame 
 
If I could through myself 
Set your spirit free 
I'd lead your heart away 
See you break, break away 
Into the light... 
And to the day 
 
Oooh oooh, oooh oooh, oooh oooh oooh... 
 
To let it go! And so to fade away 
To let it go!

Wide awake! I'm not sleeping, oh no, no, no...

Tell you what I would say 
True colors fly in blue and black 
Bruised silken sky and burning flag 
Colors crash, collide in blood shot eyes 
 
Oooh oooh, oooh oooh, oooh oooh oooh...

  Bono:  This is...this is a song about the city we grew up in.  A song about Dublin city. And a song about a drug called heroin  that's tearing our city in two...that's tearing the...the heart  out of the city of Dublin...tearing the heart out of the city of  Chicago. Rich people stuff dollars in the back of their pocket  while poor men lie in gutters with needles stuck in their arms.  Screw them, I say. This is a song about a friend of mine who was  given on his 21st birthday enough heroin into his bloodstream to  kill him. This is a song called Bad.

 You don't have to break your heart 
In two my love 
You don't have to play a part 
It's you I love 
You don't have to hide from yourself 
You don't have to be someone else again 
 
 
You don't have to rescue me 
You don't have to watch me drown 
You don't have to give to me 
All I want is you 
 
 
Be there, my love 
Be there, tonight 
Be there, my love 
Be there, tonight 
 
 
You don't have to dress yourself up 
Or stay the same 
You don't have to smile 
If I say smile 
 
 
You don't have to be the best 
You don't have to give me rest 
All I want is all you have 
Nothing else 
Nothing 
 
 
Be there, my love 
Just be there, my love 
 
 
If you want the whole of me 
That's all you'll get 
I'll sing this song 
I'd give my health 
Give it all 
You don't have to... 
 
 
Ah, she comes on by 
She says, I need you, my love 
Ah, she says, all I want is you 
 
 
You don't have to play your little game 
If I fall apart 
You don't have to work those strings 
Or do those things 
You're enough in my heart 
 
 
You don't have to hide from yourself 
You don't have to be someone else 
All I want is all you have 
All I want is you 
 
 
Be there, my love 
Be there, tonight 
Be there, my love 
Be there, tonight

BEAUTIFUL DAY

 The heart is a bloom 
Shoots up through the stony ground 
There's no room 
No space to rent in this town 
 
 
You're out of luck 
And the reason that you had to care 
The traffic is stuck 
And you're not moving anywhere 
 
 
You thought you'd found a friend 
To take you out of this place 
Someone you could lend a hand 
In return for grace 
 
 
It's a beautiful day 
Sky falls, you feel like 
It's a beautiful day 
Don't let it get away 
 
 
You're on the road 
But you've got no destination 
You're in the mud 
In the maze of her imagination 
 
 
You love this town 
Even if that doesn't ring true 
You've been all over 
And it's been all over you 
 
 
It's a beautiful day 
Don't let it get away

Touch me 
Take me to that other place 
Teach me 
I know I'm not a hopeless case 
 
 
See the world in green and blue 
See China right in front of you 
See the canyons broken by cloud 
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out 
See the Bedouin fires at night 
See the oil fields at first light 
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth 
After the flood all the colors came out 
 
 
It was a beautiful day 
Don't let it get away 
Beautiful day 
 
 
Touch me 
Take me to that other place 
Reach me 
I know I'm not a hopeless case

  Boy girl, boy girl
  When a boy meets a girl
  Boy girl
  
  
  Finding out
  I'm finding out the things
  That I've been talking about
  I'm finding all the things
  That I've been missing out
  Finding all the things
  I lose my mind
  Sometimes fall behind
  
  
  You and I we live on the big ship
  And time goes by
  You make up and I believe a lady's lie
  Your skin is colored strawberries and cream
  Sometimes I scream
  
  
  Boy girl, boy girl
  When a boy meets a girl
  Boy girl
  
  
  We go out
  A picture or a disco or a roundabout
  I walk you home, I hold you there
  You're giving out
  I open doors so I can shut your face
  Know your place
  
  
  Boy girl, boy girl
  When a boy meets a girl
  Boy girl
  
  
  You can take me in your hand
  Stand back, leave me, come in
  Up and down and all around
  You will sideways to the ground
  
  
  Boy girl, boy girl
  When a boy meets a girl

BULLET THE BLUE SKY

 In the howling wind comes a stinging rain 
See it driving nails 
Into the souls on the tree of pain 
From the firefly, 
A red orange glow 
See the face of fear 
Running scared in the valley below 
 
Bullet the blue sky 
Bullet the blue sky 
Bullet the blue 
Bullet the blue 
...ah...ah... 
 
In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum 
Jacob wrestled the angel 
And the angel was overcome 
You plant a demon seed 
You raise a flower of fire 
See them burning crosses 
See the flames higher and higher 
 
Bullet the blue sky 
Bullet the blue sky 
Bullet the blue 
...ah... 
Bullet the blue 
...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah... 
 
This guy comes up to me 
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush 
Like all the colors of a royal flush 
And he's peeling off those dollar bills 
Slappin' 'em down 
One hundred, two hundred 
 
And I can see those fighter planes 
And I can see those fighter planes 
Across the mud huts where the children sleep 
Through the alleys of a quiet city street 
You take the staircase to the first floor 
You turn the key and slowly unlock the door 
As a man breathes into a saxophone 
And through the walls you hear the city groan 
Outside it's America 
Outside it's America 
 
Across the field you see the sky ripped open 
See the rain through a gaping wound 
Pounding on the women and children 
Who run... 
Into the arms... 
Of America

  So I'm back in my hotel room with Johnnie Coltrane and the love  supreme. In the next room I hear some woman scream out
  that her lover's turning off, turning on the television. And I  can't tell the difference between ABC news, Hill Street Blues and  a
  preacher on the old time gospel hour, stealing money from the  sick and the old. Well the God I believe in isn't short of cash,
  mister. I feel a long way from the hills of San Salvador where  the sky is ripped open and the rain pours through a gaping wound
  pelting the women and children, pelting the women and children.  Who run, who run...into the arms...of America.

DADDY'S GONNA PAY FOR YOUR CRASHED CAR

 You're a precious stone 
You're out on your own 
You know everyone in the world 
But you feel alone 
Daddy won't let you weep 
Daddy won't let you ache 
Daddy gives you as much as you can take 
A ha sha la, a ha sha la 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 
 
A little uptight 
You're a baby's fist 
Butterfly kisses up and down your wrist 
When you see daddy coming 
You're licking your lip 
Nails bitten down to the quick 
A ha sha la, a ha sha la 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car 
 
You've got a head full of traffic 
You're a siren's song 
You cry for mama 
And daddy's right along 
He gives you the keys to a flamin' car 
Daddy's with you wherever you are 
Daddy's a comfort 
Daddy's your best friend 
Daddy'll hold your hand right up to the end

DANCING BAREFOOT

 She is benediction 
She is addicted to he 
She is the root connection and 
She is connecting with me 
 
 
Here I go and I don't know why 
I spin so ceaselessly 
Could it be he's taking over me 
 
 
I'm dancing barefoot 
Headed for a spin 
Some strange music drags me in 
It makes me come up like some heroine 
 
 
She is sublimation 
She is the essence of thee 
She is concentrating on 
He who is chosen by she 
 
 
Here I go when I don't know why 
I spin so ceaselessly 
Could it be he's taking over me 
 
 
I'm dancing barefoot 
Headed for a spin 
Some strange strange music drags me in 
It makes me come up like some heroine 
 
 
She is recreation 
She intoxicated by thee 
She has the slow sensation that 
He is levitating with she 
 
 
Here I go when I don't know why 
I spin so ceaselessly 
'Til I lose my sense of gravity 
 
 
I'm dancing barefoot 
Heading for a spin 
Some strange music drives me on 
Makes me come up like some heroine 
 
 
Oh God I feel for you 
Oh God I feel for you 
Oh God I feel for you 
Oh God I feel for you

You can hold onto something so tight

  take these hands they're good for nothing
  you know these hands have never worked a day
  take these boots they're going nowhere
  you know these boots they don't want to stray
  you got my head filled with songs
  you got my shoelaces undone
  take my shirt go on take it off me
  you can tear it up
  if you can tie me down
  
  DO YOU FEEL LOVED? DO YOU FEEL LOVED?
  
  TAKE THE colours of my imagination
  TAKE THE scent hanging in the air
  take this tangle of a conversation
  and turn it into your own prayer
  with my fingers as you want them
  with my nails under your hide
  with my teeth at your back and my tongue to tell you the sweetest  lies.
  
  DO YOU FEEL LOVED? DO YOU FEEL LOVED?
  AND IT LOOKS like the SUN BUT IT FEELS LIKE THE RAIN
  
  love's a bully pushing and shoving
  in the belly of a woman
  heavy rhythm taking over
  to stick together
  a man and a woman
  stick together

DREAMING WITH TEARS IN MY EYES

 My heart is longing for you, love 
I cared for you more then you knew 
Though you have broken each promise 
Yesterday's dreams are untrue 
 
 
Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow 
When sunshine brings memories of you 
My sunshine will turn into sorrow 
As a dream of the love you once knew 
 
 
Why should I always be lonesome 
When sunny and blue are the skies 
While shadows and loneliness linger 
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes 
 
 
Why did you promise me sweetheart 
Never to leave me alone 
Yesterday's sunshine is faded 
You're love wasn't true like my own 
 
 
Alone, I'll be yearning tomorrow 
When sunshine brings memories of you 
My sunshine will turn into sorrow 
As a dream of the love we once knew 
 
 
Why should I always be lonesome 
When sunny and blue are the skies 
While shadows and loneliness linger 
I'm dreaming with tears in my eyes

Hold on, and hold on tightly 
Hold on, and don't let go

 Black flesh in here. 
 
Black flesh of my only love 
Tell me, open my eyes. 
Black flesh come into my own mind, 
Telling me to sing... 
And I believe in you, 
And I believe in you, 
White flesh sees the sky [That's nice], and he turns its sight from you, 
But she won't turn my bag, 
And I know that real tears are blue... 
 
And you know, 
And your sky is faith in blue, 
And your heart been so cold when I'm with you, 
And you feel, like no one told you to, 
And you know time is on your side 
And you'll talk with me, 
Oh, don't talk to me, 
Aw, don't talk to me, 
Don't talk to me... 
 
And you know, 
Like no one told you how, 
But you know, 
Well, The King that howed has howled 
And revealed, like sentimental, 
But you don't care 
Without you're sharing 
In your hear ar ar art hear ar ar ar 
Heart, there sleeps a hope you see: 
I'm breaking through for you and me. 
 
And you know, 
Although no one told you to, 
And you found out when you were going: 
We're two. 
And your through with me 
 But I know that you'll be back for more... 
 
And you know, 
And though no one told you so, 
And you know: 
The sky like a heart is shades of blue. 
And you want, 
You want to let go oh oh... 
 
We live on the outside, 
Turn away, fade away, 
You can drop me down, but don't break me: 
In your castle stay 
Au di ence sighs in your heart and mind, 
Au di ence dies in your heart... and mine... 
 
Someday love will come, 
Lovin' is in your sigh, 
The War King too. 
So let me in your heart: 
It beats like something new... 
 
(I need The Edge) 
 
Keep The Edge! 
I'm at home, 
Mm an' love is... 
Stay, stay sad and resigned, 
Don't stay sad, no more be sad, 
Don't stay sad, no more be sad, 
Don't stay sad, no more be sad... 
And you know, 
And though no one told you how, (told you how) 
And you know, 
And you wipe the sweat off your white brow. (your white brow) 
And you care, (care, care) 
And though no one told, you tried, 
And your heart (and your heart) is left out from the side (from the side), 
And the rain beats down, 
And the shame (keeps) on beating down, 
And this rain keeps on coming down, 
And this sky... (is black) 
 
I'll keep the voice of emotion you want 
I'll keep on going enjoyin' instinct, Brian 
I gave away some energy why? 
I'll keep my voice up, [Keep it up!] can you go louder? 
I'll keep my voice up loud and gain the Ruler. 
 
And you know, 
And although knowing told you sky blue, 
And you feel like needle pricks and you don't care, 
You'll say, Go and kill Lear! Or the older side of me. 
 Don't you leave! 
 Don't leave out part of me! 
 Then I can't feel it! 
 I can't feel anymore! [Keep it up!] 
And I can't hold on! [Keep it going!] 
And I don't seem that flawed. 
And you pick me up: 
Bits and pieces 
On this....floor

Everlasting love 
 
 
Need you by my side 
Come and be my bride 
You'll never be denied 
Everlasting love

Open up your heart 
Feel the love you've got

When love's river flows 
No one really knows 
'Til someone's there to show the 
Way to lasting love 
 
 
Like the sun it shines 
Endlessly it shines 
You always will be mine 
Eternal love 
 
 
Whatever love went wrong 
Ours would still be strong 
We'd have our own

EXIT

 You know he got the cure 
You know he went astray 
He used to stay awake 
To drive the dreams he had away 
He wanted to believe 
In the hands of love 
 
His head it felt heavy 
As he cut across the land 
A dog started crying 
Like a broken hearted man 
At the howling wind 
At the howling wind 
 
He went deeper into black 
Deeper into white 
Could see the stars shining 
Like nails in the night 
He felt the healing 
Healing, healing 
Healing hands of love 
Like the stars shiny shiny 
From above 
 
Hand in the pocket 
Finger on the steel 
The pistol weighed heavy 
His heart he could feel 
Was beating, beating 
Beating, beating oh my love 
Oh my love, oh my love 
Oh my love 
 
My love 
 
Saw the hands that build 
Can also pull down 
 
The hands of love

Falling, falling

GOD PART II

 Don't believe the devil 
I don't believe his book 
But the truth is not the same 
Without the lies he made up 
 
Don't believe in excess 
Success is to give 
Don't believe in riches 
But you should see where I live 
I...I believe in love 
 
Don't believe in forced entry 
Don't believe in rape 
But every time she passes by 
Wild thoughts escape 
I don't believe in death row 
Skid row or the gangs 
Don't believe in the Uzi 
It just went off in my hand 
I...I believe in love 
 
Don't believe in cocaine 
Got a speed ball in my head 
I could cut and crack you open 
Do you hear what I said 
Don't believe them when they tell me 
There ain't no cure 
The rich stay healthy 
While the sick stay poor 
I...I believe in love 
 
Don't believe in Goldman 
His type like a curse 
Instant karma's going to get him 
If I don't get him first 
Don't believe that rock 'n' roll 
Can really change the world 
As it spins in revolution 
It spirals and turns 
I...I believe in love 
 
Don't believe in the 60's 
The golden age of pop 
You glorify the past 
When the future dries up 
Heard a singer on the radio late last night 
He says he's gonna kick the darkness 
'til it bleeds daylight 
I...I believe in love 
 
I feel like I'm falling 
Like I'm spinning on a wheel 
It always stops beside of me 
With a presence I can feel 
I...I believe in love 
Stop!

GRACE

 Grace 
She takes the blame 
She covers the shame 
Removes the stain 
It could be her name 
 
 
Grace 
It's a name for a girl 
It's also a thought that 
Changed the world 
 
 
And when she walks on the street 
You can hear the strings 
Grace finds goodness 
In everything 
 
 
Grace 
She's got the walk 
Not on a ramp or on chalk 
She's got the time to talk 
 
 
She travels outside 
Of karma, karma 
She travels outside 
Of karma 
 
 
When she goes to work 
You can hear the strings 
Grace finds beauty 
In everything 
 
 
Grace 
She carries a world on her hips 
No champagne flute for her lips 
No twirls or skips 
Between her fingertips 
 
 
She carries a pearl 
In perfect condition 
What once was hurt 
What once was friction 
What left a mark 
No longer stings 
 
 
Because grace makes beauty 
Out of ugly things 
 
 
Grace finds beauty 
In everything 
 
 
Grace finds goodness 
In everything

HALLELUJAH


  
  I heard there was a secret chord
  That David played to pleased the Lord
  But you don't really care for music do you
  It goes like this, the fourth the fifth
  The minor fall and the major lift
  The baffled king composing, Hallelujah
  
  
  
  Your faith was strong but you needed proof
  You saw her bathing on the roof
  Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
  She tied you to a kitchen chair
  She broke your throne, she cut your hair
  And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
  
  
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
  
  
  You say I took the name in vain
  Well I don't even know the name
  But if I did, well really, what's it to you
  There's a blaze of light in every word
  It doesn't matter which you heard
  The holy or the broken, Hallelujah
  
  
  Hallelujah...
  
  
  I did my best, it wasn't much
  I couldn't feel so I learned to touch
  I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
  And even though it all went wrong
  I'll stand before the Lord of song
  With nothing on my lips, Hallelujah
  
  
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
  
  
  Well, maybe there's a God above
  But all I ever learned from love
  Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
  And it's no complaint you hear tonight
  It's not some pilgrim who's seen the light
  It's a cold and broken Hallelujah
  
  
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

U2
HALLELUJAH, HERE SHE COMES

 I see you're dressed to kill 
I know I can't wait until 
Hallelujah...here she comes 
 
 
I see you're dressed in black 
I guess I'm not coming back 
Hallelujah...here she comes 
 
 
Born and raised 
On the wrong side of town 
You get so high 
That you can't come down 
(Yeah) 
 
 
I see the road is rough 
You know I'm not giving up 
Hallelujah...here she comes 
 
 
I know where the lady goes 
I know she got a ring on her toes 
Hallelujah...here she comes 
 
 
Born and raised 
On the wrong side of town 
You get so high 
That you can't come down 
 
 
I'm going higher, higher, higher 
Higher, higher, higher 
Higher, higher, higher 
Higher, higher, higher 
I'm gonna be there 
When that light's gonna shine 
I'm gonna be there 
When her heart kindles next to mine 
I'm gonna be... 
Here she comes 
Yeah here she comes 
 
 
I see you're dressed to kill 
I know I can't wait until 
Hallelujah...here she comes 
 
 
I see you're dressed in black 
I guess I'm not coming back 
Hallelujah...here she comes 
 
 
Born and raised 
In the wrong side of town 
You get so high 
You can't come down 
 
 
I'm gonna be there 
Higher, higher, higher 
Gonna get higher, higher, higher 
Gonna get higher, higher, higher 
Higher, higher, higher...

HEARTLAND

 See the sun rise over her skin 
Don't change it 
See the sun rise over her skin 
Dawn changes everything 
Everything 
And the delta sun 
Burns bright and violet 
 
Mississippi and the cotton wool heat 
Sixty six a highway speaks 
Of deserts dry 
Of cool green valleys 
Gold and silver veins 
Of the shining cities 
 
In this heartland 
In this heartland soil 
In this heartland 
Heaven knows this is a heartland 
Heartland, heartland 
 
See the sun rise over her skin 
She feels like water in my hand 
Freeway like a river cuts through this land 
Into the side of love 
Like a burning spear 
And the poison rain 
Brings a flood of fear 
Through the ghost ranch hills 
Death valley waters 
In the towers of steel 
Belief goes on and on 
 
In this heartland 
In this heartland soil 
In this heartland 
Heaven knows this is a heartland 
Heartland 
Heaven knows this is a heartland 
Heartland, heartland 
Heartland 
Heaven's day here in the heartland

HEAVEN AND HELL

 Once you get a chance 
You come to baby 
Right back, you call me down 
Used to think you wanted nothing to do 
Was to say nothing at all 
 
 
You went like the one time 
A two time 
You're back, and me 
Drop off the back seat 
Of a bad car 
Where finders 
Came alone 
 
 
Bono: F 
 
Wishing her out of my life 
Wishing her... 
 
 
What am I to do 
Came a talk to street 
And a time that you listen 
Don't you beg the time on me 
 
 
They said you oughta call her back 
I wanna, but afraid to say 
I won't hang up on you baby, child 
Nothing feels like this before 
 
 
Here in in my life 
Yeah in heaven and hell 
Baby you're heaven and hell 
Heaven and hell 
 
 
Bono: F 
 
 
Oh, heaven and hell 
 
 
All the time... 
 
 
Want a chance to hold you 
Want a chance to kill 
I want a chance to keep you awake at night 
When the sunlight burns through your love 
 
 
But you can't always get 
Everything you want 
You take cards from all under the table 
You're heaven, heaven and hell 
 
 
Baby you're heaven...heaven and hell 
Yeah, you're heaven...heaven and hell 
 
 
Cover me... 
 
 
Bono: E! 
 
 
Bono: Okay organ. Just organ. 
 
 
Darkness... 
You light up my darkness 
You light up my darkness 
And open up...

Bono: Organ. 
 
Bono: This time when we come in, come in a little bit quietly. Not the drums, but everyone else.

  Bono:  Well, the last few weeks have been really something  for U2. We've seen our record go to the top of the American  charts. Even Time magazine gone and put us on the gover, yeah.  And you know, even though we've worked for this, worked hard for  this for the last few years, it was never our ambition  necessarily to be number one, or to be on the cover of Time  magazine. I don't know about you, but I feel good about the fact  that...I still haven't found what I'm looking for.  
  
  I have climbed highest mountain
  I have run through the fields
  Only to be with you
  Only to be with you
  
  
  I have run 
  I have crawled
  I have scaled these city walls
  These city walls
  Only to be with you
  
  
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
  
  
  I have kissed honey lips
  Felt the healing in her fingertips
  It burned like fire
  This burning desire
  
  
  I have spoke with the tongue of angels
  I have held the hand of a devil
  It was warm in the night
  I was cold as a stone
  
  
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
  
  
  Bono:  People dancing to a U2 song, I don't believe this!   
  
  I believe in the kingdom come
  Then all the colors will bleed into one
  Bleed into one
  Well yes I'm still running
  
  
  You broke the bonds and you
  Loosed the chains
  Carried the cross
  Of my shame
  Of my shame
  You know I believed it
  
  
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
  
  
  (Yeah, sing it!)
  
  
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for...

  Exodus, moving up...
  Alright, everything's alright
  Everything's alright, yeah, yeah...

  Talk, talk, talking
  I couldn't hear a word
  A word you said
  
  He was my brother, brother
  I said there was no other
  Way out of here
  Be my brother, brother
  Gotta get out
  Gotta get out
  
  I was walking
  I was walking into walls
  I'm back again
  I just keep walking
  I walk into a window
  To see myself
  And my reflection
  When I thought about it
  My direction
  Going nowhere
  Going nowhere
  
  No one, no one is blinder
  Than he who will not see
  No one, no one is blinder

  I can't stop talk, talk, talking
  I'm talking to you

  In my brother, brother

I'M NOT YOUR BABY

 It's a beautiful day today 
Everything is going my way 
Even the words are doing what I say 
Oh babe...got to get away 
 
 
To be impossible 
Isn't that difficult 
In the city you're invisible 
When you come from a small town 
 
 
Everything is all right 
Everything is all right 
I'm not your baby...please 
 
 
A tourist in a traffic jam 
Baby sham and handy cam 
I'm not your mother, you're not my man 
I'm not your baby 
 
 
Don't treat me like I'm a trick 
I won't treat you like you're a prick 
Don't need no doctor, I'm not ill 
I'm not your baby 
 
 
Everything is all right 
Everything is all right 
I'm not your baby...please 
 
 
Cut out the poetry 
Let's hit the main artery 
No time for a tourniquet 
Let the colour's all run out of me 
 
 
You brought me all kinds of goods 
Now my heart is so full up it hurts 
It's heavy as a shopping bag 
It's full of things I should give back 
 
 
Everything is all right 
Everything is all right 
I'm not your baby...please 
 
 
Don't want you to cover me 
Smother me or mother me 
I like to feel this incomplete 
I'm not your baby 
 
Everything is all right 
Everything is all right 
I'm not your baby...please 
 
 
Not dizzy, just busy 
Didn't drink nothing fizzy 
No pills to feel easy 
Don't know what got into me 
 
 
Daylight's a kind of robbery 
The night is your geography 
So you're not white, you're pink and rosy 
You could be right, but you're way above me 
 
 
Me, I'm in recovery 
A star of pornography 
I'm a tourist, there's a lot to see 
You don't like the photographs of me 
 
 
So you've got a lot to say 
You don't sleep around, but sometimes you stray 
You don't believe, often times you pray 
For something, what is it babe 
 
 
Don't treat me like I'm a trick 
I won't treat you like you're a prick 
Don't need no doctor, I'm not sick 
I'm not your baby 
 
 
Everything is all right 
Everything is all right 
I'm not your baby...please 
 
 
I'm not your baby 
I'm not your baby 
I'm not your baby 
I'm not your baby 
I'm not your baby 
I'm not your baby 
I'm not your baby

  You don't like the photographs of me
  
  
  So you've got a lot to say
  You don't sleep around, but sometimes you stray
  You don't believe, often times you pray
  For something, what is it babe
  
  
  Don't treat me like I'm a trick
  I won't treat you like you're a prick
  Don't need no doctor, I'm not sick
  I'm not your baby
  
  
  Everything is all right
  Everything is all right
  I'm not your baby...please
  
  
  I'm not your baby
  I'm not your baby
  I'm not your baby
  I'm not your baby
  I'm not your baby
  I'm not your baby
  I'm not your baby

I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN

 I have got you under my skin 
I've got you deep in the heart of me 
 
 
So deep in my heart 
You're nearly a part of me 
I've got you under my skin 
 
 
I have tried so not to give in 
I have said to myself this affair 
Never gonna go somewhere 
 
 
But why should I try to resist 
When baby I know so well 
That I've got you under my skin 
 
 
I would sacrifice anything 
Come what might 
For the sake of holding you near 
In spite of a warning voice 
That comes in the night 
It repeats and it shouts in my ear 
 
 
Don't you know blue eyes 
You never can win 
Use your mentality 
Wake up to reality 
 
 
But each time I do 
Just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin 
 
 
'cause I've got you under my skin 
 
 
I'd sacrifice anything 
Come what might 
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of a warning voice 
That comes in the night 
It repeats and it shouts in my ear 
 
 
Don't you know you old fool 
You never can win 
Use your mentality 
Wake up to reality 
 
 
But each time that I do 
Just the thought of you 
Makes me stop before I begin 
 
 
'cause I've got you under my skin 
And I love you (when you're) under my skin

IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS

 nobody else here baby no one else here to blame 
no one to point the finger it's just you and me and the rain 
nobody made you do it, no one put words in your mouth 
nobody here taking orders when love took a train heading south 
it's the blink leading the blond 
it's the stuff the stuff of country songs 
 
HEY IF GOD WILLS SEND HIS ANGELS 
AND IF GOD WILL SEND A SIGH 
AND IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
Would everything be alright? 
 
God has got his phone off the hook babe would he even pick up if he could? 
It's been a while since we saw that child hangin' round this neighbourhood 
see His mother dealing in a doorway see Father Christmas with a begging bowl 
Jesus sister's eyes are a blister THE HIGH STREET never looked so low 
 
it's the blind leading the blond 
it's the cops collecting for the cons 
so where is the hope and where is the faith and the love? 
What's that you say to me 
does love light up your Christmas tree? 
The next minute you're blowing a fuse 
and the cartoon network turns into news 
 
HEY IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
AND IF GOD WILL SEND A SIGN 
WELL IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
WHERE DO WE GO 
 
Jesus never let me down you know Jesus used to show me the score 
then they put Jesus in show business now it's hard to get in the door 
 
it's the stuff it's the stuff of country songs 
but I guess it was something to go on 
 
HEY IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
I SURE COULD USE THEM HERE RIGHT NOW 
WELL IF GOD WILL SEND HIS ANGELS 
WHERE DO WE GO

It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs 
 
 
Hey if God will send his angels 
And if God will send a sign 
And if God will send his angels 
Will everything be alright 
 
 
God has got his phone off the hook, baby 
Would he even pick up if he could 
It's been a while since we saw that child 
Hanging 'round this neighborhood 
You see his mother dealing in a doorway 
See Father Christmas with a begging bowl 
Jesus sister's eyes are a blister

Will that make it alright 
Where do we go 
Where do we go

You know Jesus used to show me the score 
Then they put Jesus in show business 
Now it's hard to get in the door

It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs 
But I guess it's something to go on 
So where is the hope and where is the faith 
And the love...what's that you say to me 
Does love...light up your Christmas tree 
The next minute you're blowing a fuse 
And the cartoon network turns into the news 
 
 
If God will send his angels 
I sure could use them here right now 
Well if God would send his angels 
 
 
And I don't have to know how 
(Where do we go) 
And I don't need to know why 
And I don't want to promise 
(Where do we go) 
'Cause I don't want to lie 
I just want to need you 
(Where do we go) 
Tonight 
 
 
Love... 
So light, so night, by your door 
Do take my hand by your door 
So light, so night, by your door

IF YOU WEAR THAT VELVET DRESS

 tonight the moon is playing tricks again 
feeling sea sick again 
and the whole world could just dissolve into a glass of water 
 
I've been good 'cause I know you don't want me to 
do you really want me to be blue as you 
it's her daylight that gets me though 
 
we've been here before last time you scratched at my door 
the moon was naked and cold I was like a two year old 
who just wanted more 
if you wear that velvet dress but if you wear that velvet dress 
if you wear that velvet dress but if you wear that velvet dress 
 
tonight the moon has drawn its curtains 
(tonight the moon is a mirrorball) 
it's a private show no one else going to know 
(light flickers from across the hall I'm wanting) 
who'll catch the star when it falls 
 
sunlight sunlight fills my room if you wear that velvet dress 
it's sharp and it's clear 
but nothing at all like the moon 
 
it's okay the struggle for things not to say 
I never listened to you anyway 
and I got my own hands to pray

IN A LIFETIME

 Hard to tell 
Or recognize a sign 
To see me through 
A warning sign 
 
First the thunder Satisfied 
Then the storm If the past it will not lie 
Torn asunder The future, you and I 
In the storm Get blown away 
 
In a lifetime 
In a lifetime 
 
And as the rain it falls Begin again 
Heavy in my heart As the storm breaks through 
Believe the light in you So the light shines in you 
Faded and worn Without color 
Torn asunder in the storm Torn asunder in the storm 
 
Unless the sound has faded from your soul 
Unless it disappears 
 
First the thunder Selfish storm 
Then the storm Hold on the inside 
Torn asunder One life 
In the storm In the storm 
 
In a lifetime 
In a lifetime 
In a lifetime 
In a lifetime

IN A LITTLE WHILE

 In a little while 
Surely you'll be mine 
In a little while I'll be there 
 
 
In a little while 
This hurt will hurt no more 
I'll be home, love 
 
 
When the night takes a deep breath 
And the daylight has no air 
If I crawl, if I come crawling home 
WiIl you be there 
 
 
In a little while 
I won't (be) blow by every breeze 
Friday night running 
To Sunday on my knees 
 
 
That girl, that girl 
She's mine 
And I've know her since 
 
 
Since you were a little girl 
With Spanish eyes 
Oh, when I saw her 
In a pram they pushed her by 
 
 
My, how you've grown 
Well it's been 
It's been a little while 
 
 
Slow down my beating heart 
Man dreams one day to fly 
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies 
He lives on a star that's dying in the night 
And follows in the trail 
The scatter of light 
 
 
Turn it on 
Turn it on 
You turn me on 
 
 
Slow down my beating heart 
Slowly, slowly love 
Slow down my beating heart 
Slowly, slowly love 
Slow down my beating heart 
Slowly, slowly love

 Yeah... 
 
Desert sky 
Dream beneath the desert sky 
The rivers run but soon run dry 
We need new dreams tonight 
 
Desert rose 
Dreamed I saw a desert rose 
Dress torn in ribbons and in bows 
Like a siren she calls to me 
 
Sleep comes like a drug 
In God's Country 
Sad eyes, crooked crosses 
In God's Country 
 
Yeah...yeah... 
 
Set me alight 
We'll punch a hole right through the night 
Everyday the dreamers die 
See what's on the other side 
 
She is liberty 
And she comes to rescue me 
Hope, faith, her vanity 
The greatest gift is gold 
 
Sleep comes like a drug 
In God's Country 
Sad eyes, crooked crosses 
In God's Country 
 
Yeah... 
 
Naked flame 
She stands with a naked flame 
I stand with the sons of Cain 
Burned by the fire of love 
Burned by the fire of love 
Love....

IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER

 Come to me 
Come lie beside me 
Oh don't deny me 
Your love 
 
 
Make sense of me 
Walk through my doorway 
Don't hide in the hallway 
Oh love...step over 
 
 
I'll follow you down 
I'll follow you down 
 
 
In the name of whiskey 
In the name of song 
You didn't look back 
You didn't belong 
 
 
In the name of reason 
In the name of hope 
In the name of religion 
In the name of dope 
 
 
In the name of freedom 
You drifted away 
To see the sun shining 
On someone else's day 
 
 
In the name of United and the BBC 
In the name of Georgie Best and LSD 
 
 
In the name of a father 
And his wife the spirit 
You said you did not 
They said you did it 
 
 
In the name of justice 
In the name of fun 
In the name of the father 
In the name of the son 
 
 
Call to me 
No one is listening 
I'm waiting to hear from you love 
 
 
Stay with me 
It's cold in the ground 
But there's peace in the sound 
Of the white and the black 
Spilling over 
 
 
I'll follow you down 
I'll follow you down 
I'll follow you down

INDIAN SUMMER SKY

 In the ocean 
Cut, swim, deep the sky 
Like there, I don't know why 
In the forest, there's a clearing 
I run there towards the light 
Sky... 
It's a blue sky... 
 
In the awful holding deep decide 
If I could, I would 
Up for air to swim against the tide 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Up toward the sky... 
It's a blue sky... 
 
To lose along the way 
The spark that set the flame 
To flicker and to fade 
On this the longest day 
 
So wind blow through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind blow through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind blow through to my heart... 
 
You give yourself to this the longest day 
You give yourself 
You give it all away 
 
Two rivers run too deep, the seasons change 
And so do I 
The light that strikes the tallest trees 
The light that wait for I 
The light...waiting 
Up toward the sky... 
It's a blue sky... 
 
To lose along the way 
The spark that set the flame 
To flicker and to fade 
On this the longest day 
 
So wind go through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind go through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind go through to my heart 
So wind blow through my soul 
So wind go through to my heart... 
 
You give yourself to this the longest day 
You give yourself 
You give it all away...

INSIDE OUT

 Late at night 
When the motion beats down 
I feel so low, oh no 
 
 
I lived a lie 
For a thousand years 
We start to cower, oh no 
 
 
I said oh no, baby don't 
What you got to do it for 
Can't go on 
 
 
She says oh no, baby don't 
Let me take me out here 
Thank you man 
 
 
You can think your so high 
When the moon is way down low 
Take your time, feel fine 
Those ladies are so darn high 
Oh no no no 
 
 
You gamble inside out 
Forever inside out

Into the heart of a child 
I can go back 
I can stay awhile

 Singing this song makes me angry 
I'm not angry with you 
Is that all

Singing song that makes me happy 
I'm not happy with you 
Singing this song makes me pale 
Is that all

Is that all you want from me

KITE

 Something 
Is about to give 
I can feel it coming 
I think I know what it means 
 
 
I'm not afraid to die 
I'm not afraid to live 
And when I'm flat on my back 
I hope to feel like I did 
 
 
And hardness 
It sets in 
You need some protection 
The thinner the skin 
 
 
I want you to know 
That you don't need me anymore 
I want you to know 
You don't need anyone 
Or anything at all 
 
 
Who's to say where the wind will take you 
Who's to say what it is will break you 
I don't know 
Which way the wind will blow 
 
 
Who's to know when the time has come around 
Don't want to see you cry 
I know that this is not goodbye 
 
 
It's summer, I can taste the salty sea 
There's a kite blowing out of control on the breeze 
I wonder what's gonna happen to you 
You wonder what has happened to me 
 
 
I'm a man 
I'm not a child 
A man who sees 
The shadow behind your eyes 
 
 
Who's to say where the wind will take you 
Who's to say what it is will break you 
I don't know 
Where the wind will blow 
 
 
Who's to know when the time has come around 
I don't want to see you cry 
I know that this is not goodbye 
 
 
Did I waste it 
Not so much I couldn't taste it 
Life should be fragrant 
Rooftop to the basement 
 
 
The last of the rocks stars 
When hip hop drove the big cars 
In the time when new media 
Was the big idea 
That was the big idea

  And the day is dry
  And there's no water
  
  
  And you can't see the road ahead
  You can only see her
  
  
  Why is it love...
  You're holding on to all you say, girl
  Why don't you cry, don't turn away
  Away, lonesome love
  
  
  Woman...
  She's free, a woman, say
  She hides behind you open
  Woman...
  She looks at me...
  
  
  Woman...
  She hides alone within, alone inside
  She makes a mirror in, all around
  All around, now
  I'm only walking in her love
  
  
  Woman...woman...
  Girl that leave you, maybe woman
  To turn you on and leave you on too high
  We walk in love
  We fall in love
  
  
  Woman...
  
  
  Empty heart
  
  
  To turn you on and leave you on too high
  To high, anymore
  Your dark and cluttered heart
  And there's a quietness that comes to this house
  Where nobody can sleep

LEMON

 Lemon 
See through in the sunlight 
She wore lemon 
But never in the daylight 
She's gonna make you cry 
She's gonna make you whisper and moan 
And when you're dry 
She draws her water from the stone 
 
And I feel 
Like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under 
And I feel 
Like I'm holding onto nothing 
 
She wore lemon 
To colour in the cold grey night 
She had heaven 
And she held on so tight 
 
A man makes a picture 
A moving picture 
Through the light projected 
He can see himself up close 
A man captures colour 
A man likes to stare 
He turns his money into light to look for her 
 
And I feel 
Like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore 
And I feel 
Like I'm swimming out to her 
 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
 
Lemon 
See through in the sunlight 
 
A man builds a city 
With banks and cathedrals 
A man melts the sand so he can 
See the world outside 
her there 
A man makes a car 
destination 
And builds roads to run them on 
A man dreams of leaving 
But he always stays behind 
 
And these are the days 
When our work has come assunder 
And these are the days 
When we look for something other 
 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins 
Midnight is where the day begins

A moving picture 
Through the light projected 
He can see himself up close 
her there 
A man captures colour 
destination 
A man likes to stare 
there 
He turns his money into light 
To look for her 
She is the dreamer 
She's imagination 
Through the light projected 
He can see himself up close

LIKE A SONG

 Like a song I hope to sing 
I sing it for you 
Like the words I have to bring 
I bring it for you 
 
And in leather, lace, and chains 
We stake our claim 
Revolution once again 
No I won't... 
I won't wear it on my sleeve 
I can see through this expression 
And you know I don't believe 
Too old to be told 
Exactly who are you 
Tonight 
Tomorrow's 
To late 
 
And we love to wear a badge, a uniform 
And we love to fly a flag 
But I won't...let others live in hell 
As we divide against each other 
And we fight amongst ourselves 
Too set in out ways to try to rearrange 
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song 
Let the bells ring out 
Let the bells ring out 
Is there nothing left? 
Is there, is there nothing? 
Is there nothing left? 
Is honesty what you want? 
 
A generation without name, ripped and torn 
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain 
Nothing at all 
And if you can't help yourself 
Well take a look around you 
When others need your time 
You say it's time to go...it's your time 
Angry words won't stop the fight 
Two wrongs won't make it right 
A new heart is what I need 
Oh God, make it bleed 
Is there nothing left...

LOST ON A SILENT PLANET

 (Judith? Judith?) 
(Can you hear me?) 
(Can you see me?) 
 
 
 
Life on a distant planet 
Another atmosphere 
Life on a distant planet 
So cold inside of here 
 
 
You can see her 
But she can't see you 
You can call her name 
But she won't even hear you 
 
 
In the morning of the day 
To the evening 
D day and beyond 
 
 
Lost on a silent planet 
Two lone, rising stars 
Locked on a silent planet 
So close and yet so far 
 
 
Children scream and shout 
Their eyes torn out 
Judith turns around and stumbles 
To the ground 
 
 
In the morning of the day 
The evening time 
D day and beyond 
 
 
Oh...girl you fall out 
Oh...girl you come out to cry 
Have you nothing to say 
Girl you come out to cry 
Have you nothing to say 
 
 
In the morning 
On to the day time 
To the evening 
D day and beyond

  For you a virgin bride
  Find yourself in someone else

  You find your own way

LOVE IS BLINDNESS

 Love is blindness 
I don't wanna see 
Won't you wrap the night 
Around me? 
Oh my heart 
Love is blindness 
 
In a parked car 
In a crowded street 
You see your love 
Made complete 
Thread is ripping 
The knot is slipping 
Love is blindness 
 
Love is clockworks 
And cold steel 
Fingers too numb to feel 
Squeeze the handle 
Blow out the candle 
Love is blindness 
 
Love is blindness 
I don't want to see 
Won't you wrap the night 
Around me? 
Oh my love 
Blindness 
 
A little death 
Without mourning 
No call 
And no warning 
Baby, a dangerous idea 
That almost makes sense 
 
Love is drowning 
In a deep well 
All the secrets 
And no one to tell 
Take the money 
Honey 
Blindness 
 
Love is blindness 
I don't want to see 
Won't you wrap the night 
Around me? 
Oh my love 
Blindness

LOVE RESCUE ME

 Love rescue me 
Come forth and speak to me 
Raise me up and don't let me fall 
No man is my enemy 
My own hands imprison me 
Love rescue me 
 
Many strangers have I met 
On the road to my regret 
Many lost who seek to find themselves in me 
They ask me to reveal 
The very thoughts they would conceal 
Love rescue me 
 
And the sun in the sky 
Makes a shadow of you and I 
Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea 
I'm here without a name 
In the palace of my shame 
Said, love rescue me 
 
In the cold mirror of a glass 
I see my reflection pass 
See the dark shades of what I used to be 
See the purple of her eyes 
The scarlet of my lies 
Love rescue me 
 
Yeah, though I walk 
In the valley of shadow 
Yeah, I will fear no evil 
 
I have cursed thy rod and staff 
They no longer comfort me 
Love rescue me 
 
Sha la la...sha la la la 
Sha la la la...sha la la... 
Sha la la la...sha la la la 
Sha la la la...sha la la 
Sha la la la...sha la la la

I said love, love rescue me 
 
I said love 
Climb up the moutains, said love 
I said love, oh my love 
On the hill of the son 
I'm on the eve of a storm 
And my word you must believe in 
Oh, I said love, rescue me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah... 
 
Yeah I'm here without a name 
In the palace of my shame 
I said love rescue me 
 
I've conquered my past 
The future is here at last 
I stand at the entrance 
To a new world I can see 
The ruins to the right of me 
Will soon have lost sight of me 
Love rescue me

 Is there a time for keeping your distance 
A time to turn your eyes away 
Is there a time for keeping your head down 
For getting on with your day 
 
 
Is there a time for kohl and lipstick 
A time for cutting hair 
Is there a time for high street shopping 
To find the right dress to wear 
 
 
Here she comes 
Heads turn around 
Here she comes 
To take her crown 
 
 
Is there a time to run for cover 
A time for kiss and tell 
Is there a time for different colours 
Different names you find it hard to spell 
 
 
Is there a time for first communion 
A time for East 17 
Is there a time to turn to Mecca 
Is there time to be a beauty queen 
 
 
Here she comes 
Beauty plays the clown 
Here she comes 
Surreal in her crown 
 
 
Dici che il fiume 
Trova la via al mare 
E come il fiume 
Giungerai a me 
Oltre i confini 
E le terre assetate 
Dici che come fiume 
Come fiume... 
L'amore giunger 
L'amore... 
E non so pi pregare 
E nell'amore non so pi sperare 
E quell'amore non so pi aspettare

A time for Christmas trees 
Is there a time for laying tables 
And the night is set to freeze

  Bono:  New Year's Day.  
  
  All is quiet on New Year's Day
  A world in white gets underway
  I want to be with you
  Be with you night and day
  Nothing changes on New Year's Day
  On New Year's Day
  
  
  I will be with you again
  I will be with you again
  
  
  Under a blood red sky
  A world is travelled in black and white
  Arms entwined, the chosen few
  The newspaper says, says
  Say it's true it's true...
  And we can break through
  Though torn in two 
  We can be one
  
  
  I...I will begin again
  I...I will begin again
  
  
  Bono:  Begin again!  
  
  I will be with you again
  I will be with you again
  I will be with you again
  I will be with you again

NEW YORK

 In New York freedom looks like 
Too many choices 
In New York I found a friend 
To drown out the other voices 
 
 
Voices on a cell phone 
Voices from home 
Voices of the hard sell 
Voices down a stairwell 
In New York 
Just got a place in New York 
 
 
In New York summers get hot 
Well into the hundreds 
You can walk around the block 
Without a change of clothing 
 
 
Hot as a hair dryer in your face 
Hot as handbag and a can of mace 
New York 
I just got a place in New York 
 
 
New York New York 
 
In New York you can forget 
Forget how to sit still 
Tell yourself you will stay in 
But it's down to Alphaville 
 
 
New York 
New York, New York 
 
 
New York, New York 
New York 
 
 
The Irish been coming here for years 
Feel like they own the place 
They got the airport, city hall 
Asphalt, asphalt 
They even got the police 
 
 
Irish, Italians, Jews and Hispanics 
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew 
Happily not like me and you 
That's where I lost you 
 
 
New York 
New York, New York 
New York 
New York, New York 
 
 
New York 
New York 
 
 
In New York I lost it all 
To you and your vices 
Still I'm staying on to figure out 
My midlife crisis 
 
 
I hit an iceberg in my life 
You know I'm still afloat 
You lose your balance, lose your wife 
In the queue for the lifeboat 
 
 
You got to put the women and children first 
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York 
 
 
New York 
New York 
New York, New York 
 
 
In the stillness of the evening 
When the sun has had its day 
I heard your voice whispering 
Come away now 
 
 
New, New York 
New... 
New York 
 
 
New York

NIGHT AND DAY

 When the jungle shadows fall 
Like the tick tick tock of the eye of the clock 
As it's standing against the wall 
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops 
When the summer shower's through 
So a voice within me 
Keeps revealing you...you 
 
 
Night and day 
You are the one 
Only you beneath the moon 
And under the sun 
Whether near to me or far 
It's no matter, baby, where you are 
I think of you 
Night and day 
 
 
Day and night 
Why is it so 
That this longing for you follows wherever I go 
In the roaring traffic gloom 
In the silence of my lonely room 
I think of you 
Night and day 
 
 
Night and day 
Under the hide of me 
Though such a hungry yearning 
Burning inside of me 
This torment won't be through 
'til you let me spend my life making love to you 
Day and night 
Night and day 
 
 
Night and day 
Under the hide of me 
Oh, such a hungry yearning 
Burning, burning inside of me 
This torment won't be through 
'til you let me spend my life making love to you 
Day and night 
Night and day 
 
 
Night and day 
Night and day 
Night and day 
Night, night, night and day 
Night and day 
Night, night and day 
Night and day

NO MAN'S LAND

 City street lights 
And the multiple life 
But babe you gotta give and go 
 
 
Cigarette lights 
Then my finger alights 
I need to be alone 
 
 
She can take you tonight 
She can make you, that's alright 
She can break you tonight 
Don't misunderstand 
 
 
Cigarette girls 
Goes head in and whirls 
You will be a superman 
 
 
Open her booths 
Deal must to the bruiser 
Drinking all I can 
 
 
We can take that tonight 
We can make them, that's right 
We can break them tonight 
Don't misunderstand 
 
 
The light... 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
In the sea of pain 
 
 
You can take it tonight 
She can make you, that's right 
She can break you tonight 
Don't misunderstand 
'cause they cry, and... 
 
 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
In the sea at night 
 
 
We rode the streets in the morning light 
We held our day in our hands 
 
 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
Alone in the light 
In the sea at night

NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE RIVER

 I want to reach out over the Loch 
And feel your hand across the water 
Walk with you along an unapproved road 
Not looking over my shoulder 
 
 
I want to see, and I want to hear 
To understand your fears 
But we're north and south of the river 
 
 
I've been doing it wrong all of my life 
This holy town has turned me over 
A young man running from what he didn't understand 
The wind from the Loch just get colder, colder 
 
 
There was a badness that had its way 
But love wasn't lost, love will have its day 
North and south of the river 
North and south of the river 
 
 
Can we stop playing these old tattoos 
Darling I don't have the answer 
I want to meet you where you are 
I don't need you to surrender 
 
 
'Cause there's no feeling that's so alone 
As when the one you're hurting is your own 
North and south of the river 
North and south of the river 
North and south of the river 
 
 
Some high ground is not worth taking 
Some connections are not worth making 
There's an old church bell no longer ringing 
Some old songs are not worth bringing 
North...

 Rob...rob...rob, wake up. Rob...well listen, listen, look, we've been up at the new U2 readings, right. It's called Numb or something. I don't know what it's like, but it might be quite good. And even if it isn't, if it's not good, we'll just sell the multi tracks down captain lockings(???), you know, make a bit of money that way. But anyway, um, when you wake up, give me a ring and I'm going to call the studio and book some time. Oh yeah, and I want to use a full string section, okay.

But we're not the same 
Well we 
Hurt each other 
Then we do it again 
You say 
Love is a temple 
Love a higher law 
Love is a temple 
Love the higher law 
You ask me to enter 
But then you make me crawl 
And I can't be holding on 
To what you got 
When all you got is hurt 
 
One love 
One blood 
One life 
You got to do what you should 
One life 
With each other 
Sisters 
Brothers 
One life 
But we're not the same 
We get to 
Carry each other 
Carry each other 
 
One 
 
One

ONE TREE HILL

 We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill 
As the day begs the night for mercy love 
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows 
Only scars 
Carved into stone 
On the face of earth 
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill 
We see the sun go down in your eyes 
 
You run like river, on like a sea 
You run like a river runs to the sea 
 
And in the world a heart of darkness 
A fire zone 
Where poets speak their heart 
Then bleed for it 
Jara sang his song a weapon 
In the hands of love 
You know his blood still cries 
From the ground 
 
It runs like a river runs to the sea 
It runs like a river to the sea 
 
I don't believe in painted roses 
Or bleeding hearts 
While bullets rape the night of the merciful 
I'll see you again 
When the stars fall from the sky 
And the moon has turned red 
Over One Tree Hill 
 
We run like a river 
Run to the sea 
We run like a river to the sea 
And when it's raining 
Raining hard 
That's when the rain will 
Break my heart 
 
Raining...raining in the heart 
Raining in your heart 
Raining...raining to your heart 
Raining, raining...raining 
Raining to your heart 
Raining...raining in your heart 
Raining in your heart.. 
To the sea 
 
Oh great ocean 
Oh great sea 
Run to the ocean 
Run to the sea

OUT OF CONTROL

 Monday morning 
Eighteen years of dawning 
I say how long? 
You say how long? 
 
It was one dull morning 
Woke the world with falling 
I was so sad, so sad 
It was so bad, so bad 
 
I was of a feeling it was out of control 
I had the opinion it was out of control 
 
Boys and Girls 
Go to the school and girls 
They make children 
Not like this one 
 
I was of a feeling it was out of control 
I had the opinion it was out of control 
 
I was of a feeling it was out of control 
I had the opinion it was out of control 
 
Out of control...out of control...out of control...out of control...out of control... 
 
I fought fate 
There's blood on the garden gate 
The man says childhood 
It's in his childhood 
 
One day I'll die 
The choice will not be mine 
Will it be too late 
You can't fight it 
 
I was of a feeling it was out of control 
I had the opinion it was out of control

PAINT IT BLACK

 I see a red door 
And I want it painted black 
No colors anymore 
I want them to turn black 
I see the girls walk by 
Dressed in their summer clothes 
I have to turn my head 
Until my darkness goes 
 
 
I see a line of cars 
And they're all painted black 
With flowers and my love 
Both never to come back 
I see them turn their heads 
Quickly look away 
Like a newborn baby 
It just happens every day 
 
 
I look inside my self 
See my heart is back 
I see my red door 
And I want it painted black 
Maybe then I'll fade away 
And not have to face the facts 
It's not easy facing up 
When your whole world is black 
 
 
No more will my green sea 
Go turn a deeper blue 
I could not foresee 
This thing happening to you. 
If I look hard enough 
Into the setting sun, 
My love will laugh with me 
Before the morning comes 
 
 
Wanna see it painted 
Painted it black 
Love is gone 
[Repeat and fade until end]

PEACE ON EARTH

 Heaven on Earth 
We need it now 
I'm sick of all of this 
Hanging around 
 
 
Sick of sorrow 
I'm sick of the pain 
I'm sick of hearing 
Again and again 
That there's gonna be 
Peace on Earth 
 
 
Where I grew up 
There weren't many trees 
Where there was we'd tear them down 
And use them on our enemies 
 
 
They say that what you mock 
Will surely overtake you 
And you become a monster 
So the monster will not break you 
 
 
And it's already gone too far 
Who said that if you go in hard 
You won't get hurt 
 
 
Jesus can you take the time 
To throw a drowning man a line 
Peace on Earth 
 
 
Tell the ones who hear no sound 
Whose sons are living in the ground 
Peace on Earth 
 
 
No whos or whys 
No one cries like a mother cries 
For peace on Earth 
 
 
She never got to say goodbye 
To see the color in his eyes 
Now he's in the dirt 
Peace on Earth 
 
 
They're reading names out 
Over the radio 
All the folks the rest of us 
Won't get to know 
 
 
Sean and Julia 
Gareth, Ann, and Breda 
Their lives are bigger than 
Any big idea 
 
 
Jesus can you take the time 
To throw a drowning man a line 
Peace on Earth 
 
 
To tell the ones who hear no sound 
Whose sons are living in the ground 
Peace on Earth 
 
 
Jesus in this song you wrote 
The words are sticking in my throat 
Peace on Earth 
 
 
Hear it every Christmas time 
But hope and history won't rhyme 
So what's it worth 
 
 
This peace on Earth 
Peace on Earth 
Peace on Earth 
Peace on Earth 
 


 

U2
PLEASE

 so you never knew love until you crossed the line of grace 
and you never felt wanted till you had someone slap your face 
so you never felt alive until you almost wasted away 
 
you had to win 
you couldn't just pass 
the smartest ass 
at the top of the class 
your flying colours 
your family tree 
and all your lessons in history 
 
please please please get up off your knees please please leave me out of this 
 
please 
 
and you never knew how low you'd stoop to make that call 
and you never knew what was on the ground till they made you crawl 
and you never knew that the heaven you keep you stole 
 
your catholic blues 
your convent shoes 
your stick on tatoos 
now they're making the news 
your holy war 
your northern star 
your sermon on the mount 
from the boot of your car 
please please please get up off your knees please please leave me out of this 
 
please 
so love is hard and love is tough 
but love is not what you're thinking of 
 
september streets capsizing spilling over down the drain 
 shards of glass splinters like rain but you could only feel your own pain 
october talking getting nowhere november december remember 
are we just starting again? 
 
so love is big bigger than us 
but love is not what you're thinking of 
IT'S what lovers deal it's what lovers steal 
you know I've found it hard to receive 
'cause you my love I could never believe

PROMENADE

 Earth, sky, sea, and rain 
Is she coming back again? 
Men of straw sneak a whore 
Words that build or destroy 
Dirt, dry, bone, sand, and stone 
 
Barbed wire fence cut me down 
I'd like to be around 
In a spiral staircase 
To the higher ground 
 
And I, like a firework, explode 
Roman candle lightning lights up the sky 
 
In the cracked streets trampled under foot 
Sidestep...sidewalk 
I see you stare...into space 
Have I got closer now? 
Behind the face 
 
Oh...tell me... 
Charity dance with me 
Turn me around tonight 
Up though a spiral staircase 
To the higher ground 
 
Slide show, sea side town 
Coca cola football radio radio radio...

RED HILL MINING TOWN

 From father to son 
The blood runs thin 
Oooh....see faces frozen still 
Against the wind 
 
The seam is split 
The coal face cracked 
The lines are long 
There's no going back 
Through hands of steel 
And heart of stone 
Our labour day 
Has come and gone 
 
Yeah, you leave me holding on 
In Red Hill Town 
See lights go down 
 
I'm hangin' on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
I'm still waiting 
I'm hangin' on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
 
The glass is cut 
The bottle run dry 
Our love runs cold 
In the caverns of the night 
We're wounded by fear 
Injured in doubt 
I can lose myself 
You I can't live without 
 
Yeah, you keep me holding on 
In Red Hill Town 
See the lights go down on 
I'm hanging on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
I'm still waiting 
Hanging on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
On to... 
 
We'll scorch the earth 
Set fire to the sky 
We stoop so low 
To reach so high 
A link is lost 
The chain undone 
We wait all day 
For night to come 
And it comes 
Like a hunter child 
 
I'm hanging on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
I'm still waiting 
I'm hanging on 
You're all that's left to hold on to 
 
Love 
Slowly stripped away 
Love 
Has seen its better day 
 
Hanging on 
Let's go out on Red Hill 
Let's go down on Red Hill 
Let's go down on Red Hill Town 
Let's go down on Red Hill

 I talk to you 
You walk away 
You're still on the down beat 
You say you don't want my help 
But you get hurt, scared 
If your running from yourself 
 
I give you my love 
I give you my love 
Give you my love 
Still you walk away 
 
It's your own late show 
As you jump to the street below 
But where can you go 
To leave yourself behind 
Alone in the spotlight 
Of this, your own tragedy 
 
I give you my love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love, love, love... 
 
In the heart in the heart 
In the heart of the city 
Heart in the heart in 
The heart of the city 
Oh, love... 
I pour my love out for you 
And I'll bring you through 
See your not alone 
 
I give you my love, give you my love 
Give you my love, give you my love 
Give you my love, give you my love 
Give you my love, give you my love 
Give you my love, love, love 
Love, love, love, love, love...

REJOICE

 Ah... 
It's falling, it's falling 
And outside a building 
Comes tumbling down 
Inside a child on the ground 
Says he'll do it again 
 
And what am I to do 
What in the world am I to say there's nothing else to do 
He says he'll change the world someday 
I rejoice 
 
He's building, I'll follow 
In my bed when I woke up 
To what he has said 
Maybe it's grazy 
But I'm too lazy to lie 
 
And what am I to do 
Just tell me what am I supposed to say I can't change the world, 
But I can change the world in me 
If I rejoice 
Rejoice 
 
And what am I to do 
Just tell me what am I supposed to say I can't change the world, 
But I can change the world in me 
If I rejoice 
 
I don't know what to change

  Talk without speaking
  Scream without raising your voice

Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh 
It takes a second to say goodbye 
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh, say bye bye 
Where you going to now 
 
Lightning flashes across the sky 
East to west, do or die 
Like a thief in the night 
See the world by candlelight 
 
Fall, rise and...fall, rise and... 
 
In an apartment on Time Square 
You can assemble them anywhere 
Held to ransom, hell to pay 
A revolution everyday 
USSR, DDR, London, New York, Peking 
It's the puppets, it's the puppets 
Who pull the strings 
 
Fall, rise and...fall, rise and... 
 
Say goodbye, say goodbye 
Say goodbye, say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
 
It takes a second to say goodbye 
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh 
 
Push the button and pull the plug 
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh 
 
Fall, rise and...fall, rise and... 
 
And they're doing the atomic bomb 
Do they know where the dance comes from 
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb 
They want you to sing along 
Say goodbye, say goodbye 
Say goodbye 
Say goodbye

SHADOWS AND TALL TREES

 Back to the cold restless streets at night 
I talk to myself about tomorrow night 
Walls of white protest 
A gravestone in name 
Who is it now 
It's always the same 
 
Who is it now 
Who calls me inside 
Are the leaves on the trees 
Just a living disguise 
I walk the sweet rain tragicomedy 
I'll walk home again 
To the street melody 
 
But I know, oh no 
But I know, oh no 
But I know 
 
Shadows and tall trees 
Shadows and tall trees 
Shadows and tall trees 
Shadows and tall trees 
 
Life through a window 
Discoloured pain 
Mrs. Brown's washing is always the same 
I walk street rain tragicomedy 
I'll walk home again 
To the street melody 
 
But I know, oh no 
But I know, oh no 
But I know 
 
...out there... 
 
Do you feel in me 
Anything redeeming 
Any worthwhile feeling 
Is life like a tightrope 
Hanging from the ceiling 
 
But I know, oh no 
But I know, oh no 
But I know 
 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadow...shadow...shadow 
Shadow...shadow...shadow 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Don't be my shadow...shadow...shadow 
It's only my shadow...shadow...shadow 
Shadows and Tall Trees 
Shadows and Tall Trees

SHE'S A MYSTERY TO ME

 Darkness falls and she 
Will take me by the hand 
Take me to some twilight land 
Where all but love is gray 
Where I can find my way 
Without her as my guide 
 
 
Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell 
Daylight falls, our heaven turns to hell 
Am I left to burn 
And burn eternally 
She's a mystery to me 
 
 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
 
 
In the night of love 
Words tangled in her hair 
Words soon to disappear 
A love so sharp it cut 
Like a switchblade to my heart 
Words tearing me apart 
 
 
She tears again my bleeding heart 
I want to run, she's pulling me apart 
Fallen angel cries 
Then I just melt away 
She's a mystery girl 
 
 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
 
 
Haunted by her side 
It's a darkness in her eyes 
That so enslaves me 
And if my love is blind 
Then I don't want to see 
She's a mystery to me 
 
 
Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell 
Daylight comes, our heaven turns to hell 
Am I left to burn 
And burn eternally 
She's a mystery to me 
 
 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
 
 
She's...a mystery girl 
Mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's...a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl 
She's a mystery girl

SILVER AND GOLD


  
  In the shit house a shotgun
  Praying hands hold me down
  Only the hunter was hunted
  In this tin can town
  Tin can town
  
  No stars in the black night
  Looks like the sky fell down
  No sun in the daylight
  Looks like it's chained to the ground
  Chained to the ground
  The warden said:
   The exit is sold.
  If you want a way out,
  Silver and gold. 
  
  Broken back to the ceiling
  Broken nose to the floor
  I scream at the silence, it's crawling
  It crawls under the door
  There's a rope around my neck
  And there's a trigger in your gun
  Jesus say something
  I am someone, I am someone
  I am someone
  
  Captain and kings
  In the ships hold
  They came to collect
  Silver and gold
  Silver and gold
  
  Seen the coming and the going
  Seen them captains and the kings
  See them navy blue uniforms
  See them bright and shiny things
  Bright shiny things
  
  The temperature is rising
  The fever white hot
  Mister, I ain't got nothing
  But it's more than you got
  
  Chains no longer bind me
  Not the shackles at my feet
  Outside are the prisoners
  Inside the free
  Set them free
  Set them free
  
  A prize fighter in a corner is told
  Hit where it hurts
  Silver and gold
  Silver and gold
  
  Yep, silver and gold. This song was written in a hotel room in  New York city 'round the time a friend of ours, Little Steven,  was
  putting together a record of artists against apartheid. This is a  song written about a man in a shanty town outside of
  Johannesburg. A man who's sick and tired of looking down the  barrel of white South Africa. A man who is at the point where
  he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor. A man who has  lost faith in the peacemakers of the west while they argue
  and while they fail to support a man like bishop Tutu and his  request for economic sanctions against South Africa.
  Am I buggin' you? I don't mean to bug ya.
  Okay Edge, play the blues.

SLOW DANCING

 My love is cruel as the night 
She steals the sun, and shuts out the light 
All of my colors, they turn to blue 
Win or lose 
 
 
She does it slow dancing 
Slow dancing 
She does it slow...dancing 
All night long 
 
 
Scarlet eyes and a see through heart 
She saw me coming right from the start 
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees 
Just a' beggin' her, beggin' her please 
 
 
Take me slow dancing 
Slow dancing 
She took me slow...dancing 
All night long 
 
 
And I don't know why a man 
Search for himself in his lover's eyes 
No I don't know why a man 
Sees the truth but needs the lies 
 
 
My love is restless as the wind 
She moves like a shadow across my skin 
She left with my conscience, I don't want it back 
It just gets in the way 
 
 
If you wanna go slow dancing 
Slow dancing 
She took me slow...dancing 
All night long 
 
 
Slow...dancing 
Slow...dancing 
Slow...

SO CRUEL

 We crossed the line 
Who pushed who over? 
It doesn't matter to you 
It matters to me 
 
We're cut adrift 
We're still floating 
I'm only hanging on 
To watch you go down 
My love 
 
I disappeared in you 
You disappeared from me 
I gave you everything you ever wanted 
It wasn't what you wanted 
 
The men who love you, you hate the most 
They pass through you like a ghost 
They look for you, but your spirit is in the air 
Baby, you're nowhere 
 
Oh...love... 
You say in love there are no rules 
Oh...love... 
Sweetheart, 
You're so cruel 
 
Desparation is a tender trap 
It gets you every time 
You put your lips to her lips 
To stop the lie 
 
Her skin is pale like God's only dove 
Screams like an angel for your love 
Then she makes you watch her from above 
And you need her like a drug 
 
Oh...love... 
You say in love there are no rules 
Oh...love... 
Sweetheart, 
You're so cruel 
 
She wears my love like a see through dress 
Her lips say one thing 
Her movements something else 
Oh love, like a screaming flower 
Love...dying every hour...love 
 
You don't know if it's fear or desire 
Danger the drug that takes you higher 
Head in heaven, fingers in the mire 
 
Her heart is racing, you can't keep up 
The night is bleeding like a cut 
Between the horses of love and lust 
We are trampled underfoot 
 
Oh...love... You say in love there are no rules 
Oh...love... 
Sweetheart, 
You're so cruel 
 
Oh...love... 
To stay with you I'd be a fool 
Sweetheart 
You're so cruel

SOME DAYS ARE BETTER THAN  OTHERS


  
  Some days are dry, some days are leaky
  Some days come clean, other days are sneaky
  Some days take less, but most days take more
  Some slip through your fingers and onto the floor
  
  Some days you're quick, but most days you're speedy
  Some days you use more force than is necessary
  Some days just drop in on us
  Some days are better than others
  
  Some days it all adds up
  And what you got is not enough
  Some days are better than others
  
  Some days are slippy, other days sloppy
  Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy
  Your skin is white but you think you're a brother
  Some days are better than others
  
  Some days you wake up with her complaining
  Some sunny days you wish it was raining
  Some days are sulky, some days have a grin
  And some days have bouncers and won't let you in
  
  Some days you hear a voice
  Taking you to another place
  Some days are better than others
  
  Some days are honest, some days are not
  Some days you're thankful for what you've got
  Some days you wake up in the army
  And some days it's the enemy
  
  Some days are work, most days you're lazy
  Some days you feel like a bit of a baby
  Lookin' for Jesus and His mother
  Some days are better than others
  
  Some days you feel ahead
  You're making sense of what she said
  Some days are better than others
  
  Some days you hear a voice
  Taking you to another place

Wey hey hey, you know that 
The night is young 
Dazzled by lights that shine in your eyes

And wait for the night 
Forever in fever, forever in heat 
You pick me up to put me out on the street

SPRINGHILL MINING DISASTER

 Bono: Like to...I'd like to try a song that I think we've only played once before, so. This is a city that a...a lot of Irish people came to this city, right? So this time...this Irish...these Irish people came as rock and roll band, okay? So...but this is a folk song. It's like...the Irish kinda' hold America in a very special place because, for over a hundred years or more, Irish have come over here to find work and find a future. And they brouught with them songs, old Irish folk songs that became old American folk songs. And, I hope maybe we'd leave behind some songs one day. This is a song written by Peggy Seeger. It's a song...I wished I'd heard this song on the raidio during the miners' strike in England a few years ago. This is called Springhill Mining Disaster. 
 
In the town of Springhill Nova Scotia 
Down in the dark of the Cumberland mine 
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie 
In roads that never saw sun or sky 
Roads 
 
 
Bono: Shut up for a second, will you? Stop whistling 'cause I'm not in the Beatles, okay? It's U2 here. 
 
In the town of Springhill 
They don't sleep easy 
Often the earth will tremble and roll 
When the earth is restless 
Miners die 
 
 
Bone and blood is the price of coal 
Bone and blood is the price of coal 
 
 
Listen to the shouts of the black faced miner 
Listen to the call of the rescue team 
We have no water, light or bread 
So we're living on songs and hope instead 
Living on songs and hope instead 
 
 
In the town of Springhill Nova Scotia 
Down in the dark of the Cumberland mine 
There's blood on the coal, and the miners lie 
In roads that never saw sun or sky 
Roads that never saw sun nor sky 
 
 
In the town of Springhill 
Don't sleep easy 
Often the earth will tremble and roll 
When the earth is restless 
Miners die 
 
 
Bone and blood is the price of coal 
Bone and blood is the price of coal 
Bone and blood is the price of coal

STARING AT THE SUN

 SUMMER stretching on the grass summer dresses pass 
in the shade of a willow tree creeps a crawling over me 
over me and over you stuck together with God's glue 
it's going to get stickier too 
it's been a long hot summer 
let's get undercover 
don't try too hard to think don't think at all 
 
I'm not the only one starin' at the sun 
afraid of what you'd find if you took a look inside 
not just deaf and dumb I'm staring at the sun 
not the only one who's happy to go blind 
 
there's an insect in your ear if you scratch it won't disappear 
it's gonna itch and burn and sting 
do you want to see what the scratching brings 
waves that leave me out of reach 
breaking on your back like a beach 
will we ever live in peace? 
'cause those that can't do often have to 
those that can't do often have to preach 
 
to the ones staring at the sun 
afraid of what you'll find if you took a look inside 
not just deaf and dumb staring at the sun 
I'm not the only one who'd rather go blind 
 
intransigence is all around military still in town 
armour plated suits and ties daddy just won't say goodbye 
referee won't blow the whistle God is good but will HE listen 
I'm nearly great 
but there's something I'm missing I left in the duty free 
though you never really belonged to me 
 
you're not the only one starin' at the sun 
afraid of what you'd find if you stepped back inside 
I'm not sucking my thumb I'm staring at the sun 
not the only one who's happy to go blind

STARING AT THE SUN (NEW MIX)

 Summer stretching on the grass 
Summer dresses pass 
In the shade of a willow tree 
Creeps a crawling over me 
 
 
Over me and over you 
Stuck together with God's glue 
It's going to get stickier too 
It's been a long hot summer 
Let's get under cover 
Don't try too hard to think 
Don't think at all 
 
 
I'm not the only one 
Staring at the sun 
Afraid of what you'll find 
If you took a look inside 
 
 
I'm not just deaf and dumb 
Staring at the sun 
Not the only one 
Who's happy to go blind 
 
 
There's an insect in your ear 
If you scratch it won't disappear 
It's going to itch and burn and sting 
You want to see what the scratching brings 
 
 
Waves that leave me out of reach 
Breaking on your back like a beach 
Will we ever live in peace 
'Cause those that can't do 
Often have to 
And those that can't do 
Often have to preach 
 
 
To the ones 
Staring at the sun 
Afraid of what you'll find 
If you took a look inside 
 
 
Not just deaf and dumb 
Staring at the sun 
I'm not the only one 
Who'd rather go blind 
 
 
Intransigence is all around 
Military still in town 
Armour plated suits and ties 
Daddy just won't say goodbye 
 
 
Referee won't blow the whistle 
God is good but will He listen 
I'm nearly great 
But there's something missing 
I left it in the duty free 
But you never really belonged to me 
 
 
You're not the only one 
Staring at the sun 
Afraid of what you'd find 
If you stepped back inside 
 
 
I'm sucking on my thumb 
Staring at the sun 
I'm not the only one 
Who's happy to go blind 
 
 
I'm not the only one...

STAY (FARAWAY, SO CLOSE!)

 Green light, Seven Eleven 
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes 
You don't smoke, don't even want to 
Hey now, check your change 
Dressed up like a car crash 
Your wheels are turning but you're upside down 
You say when he hits you, you don't mind 
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive 
Hey babe, is that what it is 
 
 
Red lights, gray morning 
You stumble out of a hole in the ground 
A vampire or a victim 
It depends on who's around 
You used to stay in to watch the adverts 
You could lip synch to the talk shows 
 
 
And if you look, you look through me 
And when you talk, you talk at me 
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing 
 
 
If I could stay... 
Then the night would give you up 
Stay...and the day would keep its trust 
Stay...and the night would be enough 
 
 
Faraway, so close 
Up with the static and the radio 
With satellite television 
You can go anywhere 
Miami, New Orleans 
London, Belfast and Berlin 
 
 
And if you listen I can't call 
And if you jump, you just might fall 
And if you shout, I'll only hear you 
 
 
If I could stay... 
Then the night would give you up 
Stay...then the day would keep its trust 
Stay...with the demons you drowned 
Stay...with the spirit I found 
Stay...and the night would be enough 
 
 
Three o'clock in the morning 
It's quiet and there's no one around 
Just the bang and the clatter 
As an angel runs to ground 
 
 
Just the bang 
And the clatter 
As an angel 
Hits the ground

STORIES FOR BOYS

 There's a place I go 
And I am far away 
There's a TV show 
And I can grow 
 
Sometimes the hero takes me 
Sometimes I don't let go 
Hello, hello 
 
There's a picture book 
With colored photographs 
There's a comic strip 
That makes me laugh 
 
Sometimes the lady takes me 
Sometimes I don't let go 
Hello, hello

STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND

 Stranger 
Stranger in a stange land 
He looked at me like I 
Was the one who should run 
We asked him to smile for a photograph 
Waited a while to see if we could make him laugh 
 
Oh...oh... 
 
A soldier asked for a cigarette 
His smiling face I can't forget 
He looked like me across the street 
But that's a long way here 
 
Oh...oh... 
 
And I wish you were here 
Oooh, and I wish you were here 
 
Oh...oh... 
 
Stranger 
A stranger in a strange land 
He look at me like I 
Was the one who should run 
I watched as he watched us get back on the bus 
I watched the way it was 
The way it was when he was with us 
 
And I really don't mind 
Sleeping on the floor 
But I couldn't sleep after what I saw 
I wrote this letter to tell you 
The way I feel 
 
Oooh, I wish you were here 
Oooh, I wish you were here 
To see what I could see 
To hear 
And I wish you were here 
Oh...oh...

Man, I just got here 
You got me thinking 
I'm about to leave 
 
 
Some say maybe tomorrow 
New direction, hello 
What I know know know 
What I know know know 
 
 
I walk tall 
I walk in the wild wind 
I love to stare 
I love to watch myself grow 
 
 
Someday, maybe tomorrow

STUCK IN A MOMENT YOU CAN'T  GET OUT OF (ACOUSTIC VERSION)


  
  I'm not afraid of anything in this world
  There's nothing you can throw at me that I haven't already heard
  I'm just trying to find a decent melody
  A song that I can sing in my own company 
  
  You've got to get yourself together
  You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it
  Don't say that later will be better now you're stuck in a moment
  And you can't get out of it 
  
  I will not forsake the colors that you bring
  But the nights you filled with fireworks
  They left you with nothing
  I am still enchanted by the light you brought to me
  I listen through your ears, through your eyes I can see 
  
  And you are such a fool
  To worry like you do
  I know it's tough, and you can never get enough
  Of what you don't really need now ... my oh my 
  
  You've got to get yourself together
  You've got stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it
  Oh love look at you now
  You've got yourself stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it  
  
  I was unconscious, half asleep
  The water is warm till you discover how deep
  I wasn't jumping for me it was a fall
  It's a long way down to nothing at all 
  
  You've got to get yourself together
  You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it
  Don't say that later will be better now
  You're stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it 
  
  And if the night runs over
  And if the day won't last
  And if your way should falter
  Along this stony pass
  It's just a moment
  This time will pass

SUMMER RAIN

 When you stop seeing beauty 
You start growing old 
The lines on your face 
are a map to your soul 
 
 
When you stop taking chances 
You'll stay where you sit 
You won't live any longer 
But it'll feel like it 
 
 
I lost myself in the summer rain 
I lost myself 
I lost myself in the summer rain 
In the summer rain 
 
 
Tequila and Orange 
Jamaica and rum 
At the Morella 
Honey on my tongue 
 
 
In a small boat on a generous sea 
You let me be your enemy 
Tiny hand 
With a grip on the world 
Holding our breath now 
Diving for pearls 
 
 
I lost myself in the summer rain 
I lost myself 
I lost myself in the summer rain 
 
 
Just as you find me 
Always I will be 
A little bit too free 
With myself 
 
 
Just as you find me 
Always I will be 
A little bit too free 
With myself 
 
 
I lost myself in the summer rain 
I lost myself 
Now there's no one else 
In the summer rain 
 
 
Raining down 
Raining down 
Rain 
 
 
Raining now 
Raining now 
 
 
Just as you find me 
Always I will be 
A little bit too free 
With myself 
 
 
Just as you find me 
Always I will be 
A little bit too free 
With myself 
 
 
It's not why you're running 
It's where you're going 
It's not what you're dreaming 
But what you're gonna do 
 
 
It's not where you're born 
It's where you belong 
It's not how weak 
But what will make you strong

With lovers and lies 
Bright blue eyes 
Oh, the city is bright 
It's brighter than day tonight 
 
Surrender, Surrender 
Surrender, Surrender 
 
Sadie said she couldn't work out 
What it was all about 
And so she let go 
Now Sadie's on the street 
And the people she meets you know 
She tried to be a good girl and a good wife 
Raise a good family 
Lead a good life 
It's not good enough 
She got herself up on the 48th floor 
Gotta find out 
Find out what she's living for 
 
Surrender, Surrender 
Surrender, Surrender 
 
Tonight... 
 
Oh, the city's afire 
A passionate flame 
It knows me by name 
Oh, the city's desire 
To take me for more and more 
It's in the street, getting under my feet 
It's in the air, it's everywhere 
I look for you 
It's in the things I do and say 
If I wanna live I gotta 
Die to myself someday 
 
Papa sing my sing my sing my song 
Papa sing my sing my sing my song...

 And I'll coming to say goodbye 
Took inside and maids by buck bye 
More than dreams and the bottom come 
When she would come back, right and well 
 
 
And if you catch me I'll take your time 
Ride on home in monday's own 
Of this coldness in my heart 
And this whole world riding home 
 
 
Sweet baby Jane, sweet baby Jane 
Sweet baby Jane, sweet baby Jane 
 
 
And if you call, I'll come running 
And if you ask, I will be given 
And if you need me, I will be there 
When you rush when the feeling's gone 
I'll give you hope, I'll give you hate

  Oh, baby child...
  
  It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
  It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
  They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon
  You know I don't see you when she walks in the room
  
  It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
  It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
  They say a secret is something you tell one other person
  So I'm telling you, child
  
  
  A man will beg
  A man will crawl
  On the sheer face of love
  Like a fly on a wall
  It's no secret at all
  
  It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
  It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
  Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
  All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief
  
  Over love...
  
  
  A man will rise
  A man will fall
  From the sheer face of love
  Like a fly from a wall

A lover like no other

Gives me hope when I can't believe

I have a brother 
When I'm a brother in need 
I spend my whole time running 
He spends his running after me 
 
 
When I feel myself going down 
I just call and he comes around 
But for the first time 
I feel love 
 
 
My father is a rich man 
He wears a rich man's cloak 
Gave me the keys to his kingdom coming 
Gave me a cup of gold 
 
 
He said I have many mansions 
And there are many rooms to see 
But I left by the back door 
And I threw away the key 
And I threw away the key

THE FOOL

 Alive in an ocean 
A world that I didn't see 
I walk the world backways 
It's aways the same ballgame 
 
 
That's out of mind 
Out of the living world 
Out of time 
I break all the rules 
They call me a fool 
 
 
I cartoon in motion 
A hero pretends no pain 
A clown slipping backwards 
You laugh at another's shame 
 
 
But I don't mind 
I know I'm limping low down 
I don't mind 
Winners or losers 
It's all just a game 
And I'm going down 
And I'm strolling down 
 
 
Life and an answer 
The key to an open door 
Admiting I'm laughing 
Living I'm limping more 
 
 
It's out of mind 
Out of the living world 
Out of time 
Winners or losers 
It's always a game 
And I'm going down 
But I'm strolling down 
To rout around 
And around, and around 
To round round 
There's a cloud 
There's a cloud 
 
 
So...the fool has found the golden key 
So...it's waiting there for you and me 
 
 
Just a fool, a street jester 
The hero of society 
Just a fool, a street jester 
Look at me, now can't you see 
 
 
A life in emotion 
A world I'm glad I didn't see 
A cartoon in motion 
A key to the same day 
 
 
I don't mind, I'm here to know 
I wanna go go go go go 
 
 
So...the fool has found the golden key 
It's so...it's waiting there for you and me 
Just a fool, a street jester 
The hero of society 
Just a fool, a street jester 
Look at me, now can't you see

THE HANDS THAT BUILT AMERICA

 Oh my love 
It's a long way we've come 
From the freckled hills 
To the steel and glass canyons 
 
 
From the stony fields 
To hanging steel from skies 
From digging in our pockets 
For a reason not to say goodbye 
 
 
These are the hands that built America 
Ah ah ah...America 
 
 
Last saw your face 
In a watercolored sky 
As sea birds argue A long goodbye 
 
 
I took your kiss 
On the spray of a new lined star 
You gotta live in your dreams 
Don't make them so hard 
 
 
And these are the hands that built America 
Ah ah ah...America 
 
 
Of all of the promises 
Is this one we can keep 
Of all of the dreams 
Is this one still out of reach 
??? 
 
 
Its early fall 
There's a cloud in the New York skyline 
Innocence...dragged across a yellow line 
 
 
These are the hands that built America 
These are the hands that built America 
Ah ah ah...America 
Ah ah ah...America

 A picture in grey 
Dorian Gray 
Just me 
By the sea 
 
And I felt like a star

If they listened 
To what I said 
By the sea 
 
Washes my feet 
Washed my feet 
Splashes the soul of my shoes

THE PLAYBOY MANSION

 If coke is a mystery 
and michael jackson history 
if beauty is truth 
and surgery the fountain of youth 
what am I to do 
have I got the gifts to get me through 
the gates of that mansion 
 
if oj is more than a drink 
and a big mack bigger than you think 
if perfume is an obsession 
and talk shows confession 
what have we got to lose 
another push and maybe we'll be through 
the gates of that mansion 
 
I never bought a lotto ticket 
I never parked in anyone's space 
the banks they're like cathedrals 
I guess casinos took their place 
LOVE ' COME ON DOWN' 
don't wake her she'll come around 
 
chance is a kind of religion 
where you're damned for plain hard luck 
I never did see that movie 
never did read the book 
love come on down 
let my numbers come around 
 
don't know if I can hold on 
don't know if I'm that strong 
don't know if I can wait that long 
till the colours come flashing 
and the lights go on 
 
then will there be no time for sorrow 
then will there be no time for shame 
and though I can't say why 
I know I've got to believe 
 
we'll go driving in that pool 
it's who you know that gets you through 
the gates of the playboy mansion 
 
then there will be no time for sorrow 
then there will be no time for pain 
then there will be no time for sorrow 
then will there be no time for shame

Waiting for her man to come 
And take her by her hand 
And take her to this promise land

She's a pretty face 
But at the wrong time 
In the wrong place 
Woah, woah...

Her mama say one day she's gonna 
Live in America 
Yeah, America

THE WANDERER

 I went out walking 
Through streets paved with gold 
Lifted some stones 
Saw the skin and bones 
Of a city without a soul 
I went out walking 
Under an atomic sky 
Where the ground won't turn 
And the rain it burns 
Like the tears when I said goodbye 
 
Yeah I went with nothing 
Nothing but the thought of you 
I went wandering 
 
I went drifting 
Through the capitals of tin 
Where men can't walk 
Or freely talk 
And sons turn their fathers in 
I stopped outside a church house 
Where the citizens like to sit 
They say they want the kingdom 
But they don't want God in it 
 
I went out riding 
Down that old eight lane 
I passed by a thousand signs 
Looking for my own name 
 
I went with nothing 
But the thought you'd be there too 
Looking for you 
 
I went out there 
In search of experience 
To taste and to touch 
And to feel as much 
As a man can 
Before he repents 
 
I went out searching 
Looking for one good man 
A spirit who would not bend or break 
Who would sit at his father's right hand 
I went out walking 
With a bible and a gun 
The word of God lay heavy on my heart 
I was sure I was the one 
Now Jesus, don't you wait up 
Jesus, I'll be home soon 
Yeah I went out for the papers 
Told her I'd be back by noon 
 
Yeah I left with nothing 
But the thought you'd be there too 
Looking for you 
 
Yeah I left with nothing 
Nothing but the thought of you 
I went wandering

In this love song, love song 
Love song, love song 
Sun shine on me 
Bring it through to my heart 
I would give you everything 
I will give you my desire 
 
 
Sun shine, sunshine on me 
Sun shine, sunshine on me

TOMORROW

 Won't you come back tomorrow? 
Won't you come back tomorrow? 
Won't you come back tomorrow? 
Can I sleep tonight? 
 
Outside 
Somebody's outside 
Somebody's knocking at the door 
There's a black car parked 
At the side of the road 
Don't go to the door 
Don't go to the door 
 
I'm going out 
I'm going outside mother 
I'm going out there 
 
Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Will you be back tomorrow? 
 
Who broke the window? 
Who broke down the door? 
Who tore the curtain? 
And who was he for? 
Who healed the wounds? 
Who heals the scars? 
 
Open the door 
Open the door 
 
Won't you come back tomorrow? 
Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Will you be back tomorrow? 
Can I sleep tonight? 
 
Cause I want you...I...I want you...I really...I...I want...I...I... 
I want you to be back tomorrow! 
I want you to be back tomorrow! 
Will you be back tomorrow? 
 
La...la...la...la...la...la... 
 
Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Won't you be back tomorrow? 
Will you be back tomorrow? 
Open up, open up 
To the lamb of God 
To the love of he who made 
The light to see you 
He's coming back 
He's coming back 
I believe it 
Jesus coming 
 
I'm gonna be there 
I'm gonna be there mother 
I'm gonna be there mother 
I'm going out there 
Oooh...oooh 
And you're gonna be there

TREASURE

 I like to smile 
But I like to mostly stay with you 
I like good times 
But I can't feel this without you 
By my song 
The heart is in the place 
I sing this song 
Probably so 
 
 
If I could sigh 
I'd tell the world I'd felt with you 
I like the time 
I like the feeling when 
I feel you in my arms 
I'll take you in my hand 
I'll let you go 
Somebody save me 
Somebody save me 
 
 
Sing it 
Sing my, sing my song 
We sing the same old song loud 
 
 
Smile...though your heart breaks in two 
Touch me...when will I be with you 
 
 
I like good times 
But I can feel it's going wrong 
You sing the same old song 
Now I think it's time to get it right 
 
 
Sing it out, sing out... 
Sing this same old song 
 
 
If I could swim, I'd swim in circles 
If I could drown, I'd, I'd drown with you 
If I had enough of my life 
I can't tell 
If I had enough of you

Lips were dry, throat like rust 
You gave me shelter from the heat and the dust

They're closed but I see something

I'm caught in a late night play 
It's all, it's everything

You say I'm not for you

Two hearts beat as one 
Two hearts... 
 
Can't stop the dance 
Honey, this is my last chance 
I said, can't stop the dance 
Maybe this is my last chance 
 
Two hearts beat as one 
Two hearts beat as one 
Two hearts... 
 
They beat on black, beat on white 
Beat on everything don't get it right 
Beat on you, beat on me, beat on love 
 
I don't know 
How to say what's got to be said 
I don't know if it's black or white 
There's others see it red 
I don't get the answers right 
I'll leave that to you 
Is this love out of fashion? 
Or is it the time of year? 
Are these words distraction 
To the words you wanna hear? 
 
Two hearts beat as one 
Two hearts beat as one 
 
I try to spit it out 
I try to explain 
The way I feel 
Oh, yeah 
Two hearts 
 
I can't stop the dance 
Maybe this is my last chance 
I said I can't stop the dance 
Maybe this is my last chance

  Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
  
  
  Walked together down a dead end street
  We were mixing the bitter with the sweet
  Don't try to figure out what we might of had
  Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad
  
  
  I'm just a singer, some say a sinner
  Rolling the dice, not always a winner
  You say I've been lucky, well hell I've made my own
  Not part of the crowd, but not feeling alone
  
  
  Under pressure, but not bent out of shape
  Surrounded, we always found an escape
  Drove me to drink, but hey that's not all bad
  Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
  
  
  Guess I've been greedy, all of my life
  Greedy with my children, my lovers, my wife
  Greedy for the good things as well as the bad

  The chairs are all stacked, the swinging's stopped swinging
  You say I hurt you, you put the finger on yourself
  Then after you did it, you came crying for my help

 Ooooh.... 
Sometimes I feel like I don't know 
Sometimes I feel like checkin' out 
I wanna get it wrong 
Can't always be strong 
And love it won't be long 
 
Oh sugar, don't you cry 
Oh child, wipe the tears from your eyes 
You know I need you to be strong 
And the day is as dark as the night is long 
Feel like trash, you make me feel clean 
I'm in the black, can't see or be seen 
 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 
Alright now... 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 
 
You bury your treasure 
Where it can't be found 
But your love is like a secret 
That's been passed around 
There is a silence that comes to a house 
Where no one can sleep 
I guess it's the price of love 
I know it's not cheap 
 
Oh, come on... 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 
Oh, come on!

When we could sleep on stones 
Now we lie together 
In whispers and moans 
When I was all messed up 
And I had opera in my head 
Your love was a light bulb 
Hanging over my bed 
 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way 
Oh, come on... 
Baby, baby, baby...light my way

Wait for me

UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD

 Haven't seen you in quite a while 
I was down the hold just passing time 
Last time we met was a low lit room 
We were as close together as a bride and groom 
We ate the food, we drank the wine 
Everybody having a good time 
Except you 
You were talking about the end of the world 
 
I took the money 
I spiked your drink 
You miss too much these days if you stop to think 
You lead me on with those innocent eyes 
You know I love the element of surprise 
In the garden I was playing the tart 
I kissed your lips and broke your heart 
You 
You were acting like it was the end of the world 
 
Love...love...love...love...love...love... 
Love...love...love...love...love...love... 
Love...love...love...love... 
 
In my dream I was drowning my sorrows 
But my sorrows, they learned to swim 
Surrounding me, going down on me 
Spilling over the brim 
Waves of regret and waves of joy 
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy 
You, you said you'd wait 
'Til the end of the world

We ate the food, we drank the wine 
Everybody having a good time 
Except you 
You were talking about the end of the world 
 
 
I took the money 
I spiked your drink 
You miss too much these days if you stop to think 
You lead me on with those innocent eyes 
You know I love the element of surprise 
In the garden I was playing the tart 
I kissed your lips and broke your heart 
You...you were acting like it was 
The end of the world 
 
 
(Love...love...) 
 
 
In my dream I was drowning my sorrows 
But my sorrows, they learned to swim 
Surrounding me, going down on me 
Spilling over the brim 
Waves of regret and waves of joy 
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy 
You...you said you'd wait 
'til the end of the world

VAN DIEMEN'S LAND

 Hold me now, oh hold me now 
'Til this hour has gone around 
And I'm gone on the rising tide 
For to face Van Diemen's land 
 
It's a bitter pill I swallow here 
To be rent from one so dear 
We fought for justice and not for gain 
But the magistrate sent me away 
 
Now kings will rule and the poor will toil 
And tear their hands as they tear the soil 
But a day will come in this dawning age 
When an honest man sees an honest wage 
 
Hold me now, oh hold me now 
'til this hour has gone around 
And I'm gone on the rising tide 
For to face Van Diemen's land

WALK TO THE WATER

 She said it wasn't cold 
She left her coat at home that day 
She wore canvas shoes 
White canvas shoes 
Around her neck 
She wore a silver necklace 
It was given to me by my father, she said 
It was given to me 
 
 
She took the back way home 
Passed the lights and the Summerhill 
Turned left onto the North Strand 
And on, and towards the sea 
 
 
He said he was an artist 
But he really painted billboards 
In large capital letters 
Large capital letters 
He was telling jokes 
Nobody else would listen to him 
 
 
I saw you that day 
Your lips were cherry red 
Your legs were crossed 
Your arms wide open 
 
 
Your hair was coloured gold 
Like a field of corn 
You were blown by the wind 
You were blown by the wind 
 
 
Walk, walk, walk...to the water 
Walk with me a while 
Walk, walk, walk...to the roadside 
Walk me in the light 
 
 
A room in the Royal Hotel 
Sea facing views 
A man with a suitcase 
Full of things he doesn't need 
I'm looking through your window 
I'm walking through your doorway 
I'm on the outside 
Let me in 
Let me love you 
Let me love you 
Let me... 
 
 
Walk, walk, walk...to the water 
Walk with me...yeah 
Walk, walk, walk...to the roadside 
Walk with me again

WHEN I LOOK AT THE WORLD

 When you look at the world 
What is it that you see 
People find all kinds of things 
That bring them to their knees 
 
 
I see an expression 
So clear and so true 
That it changes the atmosphere 
When you walk (in)to the room 
 
 
So I try to be like you 
Try to feel it like you do 
But without you it's no use 
I can't see what you see 
When I look at the world 
 
 
When the night is someone else's 
And you're trying to get some sleep 
When your thoughts are too expensive 
To ever want to keep 
 
 
When there's all kinds of chaos 
And everyone is walking lame 
You don't even blink now do you 
Or even look away 
 
 
So I try to be like you 
Try to feel it like you do 
But without you it's no use 
I can't see what you see 
When I look at the world 
 
 
I can't wait any longer 
I can't wait 'til I'm stronger 
Can't wait any longer 
To see what you see 
When I look at the world 
 
 
I'm in the waiting room 
I can't see for the smoke 
I think of you and your holy book 
When the rest of us choke 
 
 
Tell me, tell me 
What do you see 
Tell me, tell me 
What's wrong with me

WHEN LOVE COMES TO TOWN

 I was a sailor, I was lost at sea 
I was under the waves 
Before love rescued me 
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread 
Now I stand accused of the things I've said 
 
Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train 
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
But I did what I did before love came to town 
 
I used to make love under a red sunset 
I was making promises I was soon to forget 
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown 
But I left her standing before love came to town 
 
I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream 
The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream 
As the music played I saw my life turn around 
That was the day before love came to town 
 
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train 
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
But I did what I did before love came to town 
 
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train 
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
But I did what I did before love came to town 
 
I was there when they crucified my Lord 
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword 
I threw the dice when they pierced his side 
But I've seen love conquer the great divide 
 
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that train 
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
But I did what I did before love came to town

  Baby, can we still be friends?

  Oh, the hunter will sin for your ivory skin
  Took a drive in the dirty rain
  To a place where the wind calls your name
  Under the trees the river laughing at you and me
  Hallelujah, heavens white rose
  The doors you open
  I just can't close
  
  Don't turn around, don't turn around again
  Don't turn around, your gypsy heart
  Don't turn around, don't turn around again

WILD HONEY

 In the days 
When we were swinging form the trees 
I was a monkey 
Stealing honey from a swarm of bees 
 
 
I could taste 
I could taste you even then 
And I would chase you down the wind 
 
 
You can go there if you please 
Wild honey 
And if you go then go with me 
Wild honey 
 
 
Did I know you 
Did I know you even then 
Before the clocks kept time 
Before the world was made 
 
 
From the cruel sun 
You were shelter 
You were my shelter and my shade 
 
 
If you go there with me 
Wild honey 
You can do just what you please 
Wild honey 
 
 
Yeah, just blowing in the breeze 
Wild honey 
Wild, wild, wild 
 
 
I'm still standing 
I'm still standing where you left me 
Are you still growing wild 
With everything tame around you 
 
 
I send you flowers 
Cut flowers for your hall 
I know your garden is full 
But is there sweetness at all 
 
 
What is soul 
Love me 
Give me soul 
 
 
If you go then go with me 
Wild honey 
Won't you take me, take me please 
Wild honey 
 
 
Yeah, swinging through the trees 
Wild honey 
Wild, wild, wild

WILD IRISH ROSE

 In a field by a river 
my love and I did lie 
And on my naked shoulder 
she too proud to cry 
She said that I must leave her 
an icy tear she froze 
How could I melt the heart 
Of a Wild Irish Rose 
 
 
Well a gypsy she has made of me 
A servent of the street 
And back to bed I've travelled 
To taste a love as sweet 
Well the heart it knows no reasons 
And reason never knows 
As I lie with them I'm thinking 
Of a Wild Irish Rose 
 
 
Well I saw the city of angels 
It brought a devil out in me 
And Hell's hotel on Sunset 
Showed a whore no mercy 
As the orange sky was screaming 
From the roof I let her go 
These are the dizzying heights that brought me 
My Wild Irish Rose 
 
 
Now red is the rose 
That she layed on my grave 
A life is what she wanted 
And a life I surely gave 
Like a hundred men before me 
They lay lying here in rows 
Young men, bloody 
As a Wild Irish Rose 
 


 

U2
WIRE

 Innocent, and in a sense I am 
Guilty of the crime that's now in hand 
Such a nice day! 
Throw your life away 
Such a nice day! 
Let it go 
 
Cold these eyes, I...can't believe it 
Cold, this heart is slow 
Heart is stone 
 
Call me 
Such a cold heart 
Such a cold man 
To watch you tear your self apart 
 
So lay me down 
My soul to give 
So lay me down 
The longest sleep 
Oh...the longest sleep 
 
In I come and out you go 
You get 
Here we are again 
Now, place your bets 
Is this the time!? 
The time to win or lose 
Is this the time!? 
The time to choose 
 
Cold these eyes, I...can't believe it 
So deep inside a cold fire 
Cold, this heart is slow... 
Heart is stone 
 
Any time your on the air 
Kiss me...Ah! Would you? Ooh! 
Won't you tell me now 
That's right, just keep me going 
 
In some white track 
You come right back 
Cartoon cutout 
Cut throat let out 
I'm on your side 
Be on the both side 
I'm on right track 
You get off my back 
I'm no dope 
I give you hope 
Here's the rope 
Here's the rope 
Now...swing away!

WITH A SHOUT

 Oh, and where do we go? 
Where do we go from here? 
Where to go 
To the side of a hill 
Blood was spilt 
We were still looking at each other 
 
Oh, we're goin' back there 
Jerusalem 
Jerusalem 
 
Shout 
Shout 
With a shout, shout it out 
Shout 
Shout it out 
 
I wanna go 
To the foot of the Messiah 
To the foot of he who made me see 
To the side of a hill 
Where we were still 
We were filled 
With our love 
 
We're gonna be there again

YOUR BLUE ROOM

 It's time to go again 
To your blue room 
Got some questions to ask of you 
In your blue room 
 
 
The air is clean 
Your skin is clear 
I've had enough fun hanging 'round here 
It's a different kind of conversation 
Your blue room 
 
 
Saw me coming 
In outside 
Saw me coming 
Somewhere I can hide 
 
 
And time is a string of pearls...your blue room 
(I'm a swinger) 
See the future just hanging there...your blue room 
A new frame, a new perspective 
Looking down on my objectives 
Your instructions whatever their directions 
Your blue room 
 
 
Saw me coming 
East by the moon 
Saw me coming 
Can you feel 
 
 
(It's allright) 
 
 
Your blue room 
 
 
One day I'll be back...your blue room 
Yeah, I hope I remember where it's at...your blue room 
 
 
We see me slide 
Won't you give me a home 
So much for change 
 
 
Zooming in 
Zooming out 
Nothing I can't do without 
A lens to see it all up close 
Magnifying what no one knows 
Never in company 
Never alone 
No car alarm 
No cellular phone

Nothing I can't do without 
A lens to it all up close 
Magnifying what no one knows 
Never in company 
Never alone 
No car alarm 
No cellular phone

ZOO STATION

 I'm ready 
I'm ready for the laughing gas 
I'm ready 
I'm ready for what's next 
I'm ready to duck 
I'm ready to dive 
I'm ready to say 
I'm glad to be alive 
I'm ready 
I'm ready for the push 
 
In the cool of the night 
In the wartmth of the breeze 
I'll be crawling 'round 
On my hands and knees 
 
Just down the line Zoo Station 
Gotta make it on time oh, Zoo Station 
 
I'm ready 
I'm ready for the gridlock 
I'm ready to take it to the street 
I'm ready for the shuffle 
Ready for the deal 
Ready to let go of the steering wheel 
I'm ready 
Ready for the crush 
 
(She's just down the line)...Zoo Station 
(Got to make it on time)...Zoo Station 
 
Alright 
Alright, alright, alright, alright 
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby 
Hey baby 
It's alright, it's alright 
 
Alright, you can turn it up! 
 
Time is a train 
Makes the future the past 
Leaves you standing in the station 
Your face pressed up against the glass 
 
I'm just down the line from your love...(Zoo Station) 
You know I'm under the sign...(Zoo Station) 
I've gotta make it on time 
Make it on time...(Zoo Station) 
I'm gonna be there...(Zoo Station) 
That's alright...(Zoo Station) 
Just two stops down the line from your love...(Zoo Station) 
Just a stop down the line

ZOOROPA

 (what do you want?) 
(what do you want?) 
 
Zooropa...vorsprung durch technik (a step ahead through technology) 
Zooropa...be all that you can be 
Be a winner 
Eat to get slimmer 
 
Zooropa...a bluer kind of white 
Zooropa...it could be yours tonight 
We're mild and green 
And squeaky clean 
 
Zooropa...better by design 
Zooropa...fly the friendly skies 
Through appliance of science 
We've got that ring of confidence 
 
And I have no compass 
And I have no map 
And I have no reasons 
No reasons to get back 
 
And I have no religion 
And I don't know what's what 
And I don't know the limit 
The limit of what we've got 
 
Don't worry baby, it'll be alright 
You got the right shoes 
To get you through the night 
It's cold outside, but brightly lit 
Skip the subway 
Let's go to the overground 
Get your head out of the mud baby 
Put flowers in the mud baby 
Overground 
 
No particular place names 
No particular song 
I've been hiding 
What am I hiding from 
 
Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright 
Uncertainty can be a guiding light 
I hear voices, ridiculous voices 
Out in the slipstream 
Let's go, let's go overground 
Take your head out of the mud baby 
 
She's gonna dream up 
The world she wants to live in 
She's gonna dream out loud 
She's gonna dream out loud 
Dream out loud
