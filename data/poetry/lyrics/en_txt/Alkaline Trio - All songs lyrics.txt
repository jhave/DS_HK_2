 Schoolyard freaks are freezing, down getting teased again I'm looking back and down and watching it go by Down at the stockyards cattle screaming Tthe trains squeak by again I can feel my breath and I'm so thankful I'm not one of them The sound of the ground freezing is pounding once again It comes with the wind that once wiped off our smiles Alarm clock bells are screaming out the same routine again Scrape open your eyes, rise and fucking shine, 7 am Sit down, dead weight, and wonder Unsure, unslept, uncovered The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes, Through 5 3 eyes Schoolyard freaks are freezing, pushed to the ground again I'm looking up and west for black to fill the sky The sound of bottles breaking still breaking in my ears They opened just in time to empty out And gouge away the years Sit down, dead weight, and wonder Unsure, unslept, uncovered The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes, Through 5 3 eyes Schoolyard freaks are bleeding, down getting kicked again I can taste the earth and feel it in my eyes The sound of cattle screaming, still screaming in my ears They came in metal coffins chained me up and hacked me off my years Sit down, dead weight, and wonder Unsure, unslept, uncovered The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes, Through 5 3 eyes

97

 I've got it now, a thorn in my side the size of a Cadillac. 
Drive it through, cause backin' up now would be next to impossible. 
I had it all. 
When I was with you I forgot about everything. 
Eighteen months, eighteen months seems like fucking eternity... 
but you'll be there, to dry my eyes when I breathe you in. 
in ninety seven... in ninety seven. 
I've got it now, like a thorn in my side the size of a Cadillac. 
Drive it through, cause backin' up now would be next to impossible. 
I had it all. When I was with you I forgot about everything. 
Eighteen months... I won't breathe for eighteen months. 
I don't deserve this, 
I don't deserve this, 
I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this. 
I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this. 
I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this, no

ANOTHER INNOCENT GIRL

 He likes to act like he's all grown up He wanted to grow up to be an actor But he never told anybody He likes to spill all of his guts On the top of a well stocked bar And then swallow them bit by bit remembering every scar It's a valid reason for every drink And a new tattoo is a new reason to think He likes to pretend that he is all sewn up It makes for a much stronger case But there is blood underneath that skin That scar is not so easy to erase He walks with a glass cane now He's careful when holding his body up straight Can't go outside anymore when it's raining Can't smash up that beautiful face Another innocent girl just made his list That self pity shit is just too hard too resist And when we get home you'll see that this part of him is now part of me He likes to act like he's all grown up He wanted to grow up to be an actor But he never told anybody He likes to spill all of his guts On the top of a well stocked bar And then swallow them bit by bit remembering every scar It's a valid reason for stronger drinks And a new tattoo is a new reason to think Yeah when we get home you'll see That this part of him is now part of me Yeah when we get home you'll see That this part of him is controlling me Yeah its way too easy to fake this smile lead you on Well maybe I'm wrong but everyone gets bored once in a while

ARMAGEDDON

 I wrote the words to this song on the back of a photograph Behind your back it goes A little something like this is way to big to miss I got a letter in the mail The sender failed to let me know where it came from Opened it up and sure enough there we were arm in arm (up in arms) again I know it's small but my last call's been called half an hour ago I know it's late but do you think you could at least fix it for me Then I'll go I'll go alone I swear I won't tell a soul I'll drink this beer and write in fear of a song everybody hates Armageddon, let the light in Before we say goodbye give us something to believe in Armageddon, we're not begging For too much I don't think Just need a goodbye kiss (one last salute) Before we sink We sink 

ALKALINE TRIO
AS YOU WERE

 Stale as a 2 day half full beer Cigarette boats float around in here A field in my gut lacking sunshine Put down like a teenager's first drink I cough up compliments I think You're better off walking away while you still can She was passing through to climb a hill As you slipped and slid on my gut spill My better half was praying for you to fall Rotten like a 3 week half full glass of breast milk, drunken off my ass I would give anything to erase the past nine years of my life Put down like a prostitute in court All liberty soon to abort like my sanity Like thoughts of you She was passing through to climb a hill As you slipped and slid on my gut spill My better half was praying for you to fall Praying for you to fall So pitiful Praying for you to fall I'm fuckin' pitiful Praying for you to fall So pitiful Praying for you to fall So fuckin' pitiful

BLACKOUT

 Don't you ask me to come out 
When the sun does shine 
Let us stay here with curtains drawn 
In darkness you'll be mine 
 
Let's wait for the blackout 
The light is too bright 
Let's wait for the blackout 
Wait for the night 
 
Well welcome to my basement flat 
No windows to see through 
With darkness closing in my friend 
We'll both know what to do 
 
Let's wait for the blackout 
The light is too bright 
Let's wait for the blackout 
Wait for the night 
 
Come lay with me upon the earth 
That keeps us both alive 
No living thing has lasted here 
Yet we shall both survive 
 
Let's wait for the blackout 
The light is too bright 
Let's wait for the blackout 
Wait for the night 
 
In darkness there is no sin 
Light only brings the fear 
Nothing to corrupt the eyes 
There is no vision here 
At first you may find it strange 
But do not go away 
The darkness holds a power 
That you won't find in the day 
 
There is no vision here 
There is no vision here

BLEEDER

 You came to me like a dream, the kind that always leaves. 
Just as the best part starts, it ends so abruptly. 
And leaves you stunned and naked in your bedroom all alone. 
It s kinda funny how something so soothing gets interrupted by the ring of a telephone. 
And you broke me like the cigarette that I busted on the day I quit. 
But now that I've been drinking, I'm outta smokes and I wish that I had it. 
Woke up to my daily headache and the realization that you are gone. 
Oh my sweet darling happiness you've been away from me all along. 
One thing that I've never said, I'm truly happy in my heart and in my head. 
A lonely liver suspended in liquid.

One thing that I've never said, I'm truly happy in my heart and in my head. 
A lonely liver suspended in liquid. 
Its one thing that I never did was smile. 
Missing a case, lacking a lid. 
My heart bleeds for what you never did... 
You never did. 
For what you never did... 
Never did. 
For what you never did... 
Never did... 
Never did...

BLOODIED UP

 You don't say much of anything When questioned of your whereabouts And I just can't see through the evidence It's evident It's right in front of me in black and white and red And I don't believe in much of anything I'm glad I have people I call friends If it was up to me I'd never have to miss you It's for the better in the bitter end I guess you'd know the best You have every right to be This appalled with me Join the club I signed up a long time ago and I know how you feel And when you decked me You left me knocked out on the floor I came to bloodied up, but you weren't around I picked my teeth off the ground like they'd been there before

BYE BYE LOVE

 [Originally by The Cars] 
 
I can't feel this way much longer 
Expecting to survive 
With all these hidden innuendoes 
Just waiting to arrive 
It's such a wavy midnight 
When you slip into insane 
Electric angel rock and roller 
I hear what you're playing 
It's an orangey sky 
Always it's some other guy 
It's just a broken lullaby 
Bye bye love 
Bye bye love 
Bye bye love 
Bye bye love 
Substitution mass confusion 
Clouds inside my head 
Were fogging all my energies 
Until you visited 
Eyes of porcelain and blue 
Could shock me into sense 
You think you're so illustrious 
You call yourself intense 
It's an orangey sky 
Always it's some other guy 
It's just a broken lullaby 
Bye bye love 
Bye bye love 
Bye bye love 
Bye bye love

COP

 Wonder what it was that made you this way Maybe as a baby you dropped your rattle And it still rattles you to this day You better practice your evil looks in the mirror They don't work on me Slowly crawling up from the down low The other cops still call you 'fatso' Short fuse and a top to blow Unhappy wife, shitty life, hit the bottle Your whole world dropped from under you Left you with sorry excuses Left you with meaningless things to prove Like why you became a cop Why did you become a cop? Wonder what it was that made you this way As a boy your toys were taken away And it still toys with you to this day You better practice your evil looks in the mirror They don't work on me Slowly crawling up from the down low The other cops still call you 'fatso' Short fuse and a top to blow Unhappy wife, shitty life, hit the bottle Your whole world dropped from under you Left you with sorry excuses Left you with meaningless things to prove Like why you became a cop Why did you become a cop? Shut the fuck up. After my court date I'll forget about you I'll tell my cellmate I'll forget about you After the jail break I'll forget about you After I'm through singing this song I'll forget about you, I'll forget about you!

CRAWL

 Waking up zeroed in on medicine Am I waking up at all today Seeing lights, feeling pain There's my cure on ice I can walk but I will crawl there I will crawl there Sitting straight, feeling faint An exhausted smile screens my words But I will hear them Here's a phrase that we all know But I can't make sense I don't know words but I will hear them I still hear them Never ran away for the sake of scars Tried not to move but she was armed And shots were fired Now a hole in the head of this wounded liar Never had a drink that I didn't like Got a taste of you, threw up all night I got more sick With every sour second rate kiss Everything I never would miss again I don't know who your boyfriend is

CRINGE

 Wide eyed Knee deep in surprise Just below your thighs the temperature drops 5 degrees Your stand by flight has just arrived Tongue tied bleeding from your eyes Even Christ himself would cringe at the sight of your scars While you're counting sheep I'll count my lucky stars You were the last good thing I ever saw I lost it all I lost it all Burned out on 2 hours of shut eye Eyes glazed at the thought of the next 8 hours Headwind cold rain to wake me You were the last good thing I ever saw

DEAD AND BROKEN

 A deep dark secret 
Down at the bottom of this drink 
Can't keep it 
I've forgotten it 
 
A story that was told 
As I worked harder than we ever wished to be 
Me, I'm burning 
 
I'll grab the boat if you go grab the anchor 
The talking twine and the weights that sank her 
They weren't enough to shut up a blue light's head is shining through 
Illuminating you 
 
As we lay side by side 
Dead and broken 
Our lives aren't the same since the night yours was stolen 
Blood ran black beneath the moonlight 
Your lover's blood ran cold 
Cutting off the hands I used to hold 
 
A deep dark secret 
Down at the bottom of this drink 
Can't keep it 
I've forgotten of the story that was told 
As I worked harder than we ever want to be 
Me, I'm burning 
 
Side by side 
Dead and broken 
Our lives aren't the same since the night yours was stolen 
Blood ran black beneath the moonlight 
Your lover's blood ran cold 
Cutting off the hands we used to hold 
 
Hold..........hold............hold 
We used to hold

DEAD END ROAD

 I thought that you were joking 
When you said you couldn't breathe 
You said you couldn't breathe 
Turns out that you were choking 
On a town you couldn't leave 
You knew you'd never leave 
It met your disapproval at the age of 8 years old 
You were only 8 years old 
From then on there was no removal 
From that one way dead end road 
That one way dead end road 
 
I thought that you were laughing 
When you cried your eyeballs out 
You cried your eyeballs out 
And i don't mean to be prying 
But what were you so sad about 
What are you still sad about 
Met your disappointment at the age of 9 years old 
You were only 9 years old 
From then on there would be no ointment 
To take away these burns 
To make that pain grow dull and forever ain't that long 
When your smile's stuck in your head like a pop song 
All you think about is death 
Your dirty head has gone unswept for way too long now 
For way too long now 
 
I thought that you were sleeping 
When i found you there in bed 
I found you there in bed 
When i touched you you were freezing 
It turned out that you were dead 
It turned out that you were dead 
It met your disapproval at the age of 8 years old 
You were only 8 years old 
From then on there was no removal 
From your fucked up head and your broken home and forever ain't that long 
When your smile's stuck in your head like a pop song 
All you think about is death 
Your dirty head has gone unswept for way too long now 
For way too long now 
For way too long now 
For way too long now

FINE WITHOUT YOU

 Well I'll sit here and convince myself it's true. 
If you keep on telling your friends that we're through. 
I've got nothing here but loneliness 
Holes in walls and bleeding fists. 
My head is pounding like a pillow, like a big black song. 
 
Well my friends and I try to tell me you're gone. 
Won't listen to myself or anyone. 
You got on a plane and off you went. 
You're never coming back again. 
 
I'm trying to convince myself it's true. 
Convincing myself 
I'll be just fine without you. [x3] 
I'll be here telling myself it's true. 
 
I sit here trying to convince myself it's true. 
But you keep on pretending you have no clue. 
I'd kill for you and eat the flesh. 
Give you the heart and burn the rest. 
A thousand miles ain't shit to walk if I'm walking to hold you but 
 
I'll be just fine without you [x3] 
I'll be here telling myself 
I'll be just fine without you [x6] 
 
I'll be here telling myself it's true

HATING EVERY MINUTE

 Sit down and please make yourself comfortable 
I might need some time to dance around what I need to say 
I love you to death, I think I need a break 
 
I spend my days worried out loud 
I get in my head I choke it back down 
It hurts me inside to see you inside 
So close my ears tight, lies to decide 
 
This is the way we disappear 
It's easy if you burn out like a star 
This is the way we disappear 
It's easy like a fifty foot fall 
 
I'm waiting for a little bit of time 
To evict these words that are burning up my mind 
I'm waiting for every minute I don't speak loud 
I can be laying down 
Are you laying down? 
Are you laying down? 
 
Relax on this bed of nails 
On this plastic sheet your blood leaves a trail 
Right back to me would you please allow a moment to think?

IF YOU HAD A BAD TIME

 If you had a bad time 
At one of my parties 
Well I wouldn't expect to be seeing you soon and that's fine 
 
You have to know what and why 
Those things may you happy 
You have to know that a second guess ain't worth the try 
 
Just some words of advice 
You may have heard them before but here goes 
Just be true to yourself if it lands you in hell at least now you know 
Loud and clear if your life's big and bright some of the places you'll someday go 
With one million things holding you down, now you're one of those things 
I don't know, no big deal gotta go 
 
If you're up to your ears 
In blood, sweat and wasted years 
I'm hoping you're going to open your throat 
And just scream 
 
You have to know when, why 
Which ones miss you when you die 
You have to know a second guess ain't worth the salt in your eye 
 
Just some words of advice 
Maybe you've heard them before but here goes 
Just be true to yourself if it lands you in hell at least now you know 
Loud and clear if your life's big and bright all the places you might someday go 
With one million things holding you down, now you're one of those things 
No big deal 
 
If your seat's on my shoulders you're breaking my neck 
We get crazy with it and now you're under my bed 
Now it's dark all the time, all the time 
 
Just some words of advice 
Maybe you've heard them before but here goes 
Just be true to yourself if it lands you in hell at least now you know 
Loud and clear if your life's big and bright all the places you might someday go 
With one million things holding you down, now you're one of those things 
I don't know, no big deal here I go

JAKED ON GREEN BEERS

 It's been a long time since I've been close to you 
It's been a long time since I've been sad. 
It's been a while since I've really spent time with you 
Wish I could take back the times that I had. 
The only thing that you ever really did for me 
Was make me oh so miserable. 
And the hope that I never see your face again 
Is anything but questionable. 
 
I hope this is goodbye. 
I hope this is goodbye. 
 
There was a time when I thought you were a friend to me 
I think those times I was probably just drunk. 
And if they offered a test about being a good friend 
I'd put money down that you'd surely flunk. 
The only thing that you ever really took from me 
Were my records to sell them for dope. 
Now all I have left is this heart in my chest 
And my happiness helping me cope 
 
I hope this is goodbye [x4]

MY FRIEND PETER

 I dont care who you've been sleeping with these days 
You're outta my hair 
It's growing just above my smiling face that I wear 
Every night I drink myself to sleep 
Not thinking about you 
Not thinking about anything at all 
 
I don't care who you've been dining with these days 
It's more than fair 
Much rather be drinking anyways 
With my friend Peter 
Who lives so fucking far away 
Yet not as far as you 
Even though you live right down my fucking street 
 
And I'm tired of sleeping with myself 
I'm tired, all these drinks and drugs no longer help 
I'm tired of lying about not thinking of you 
Maybe my friend Peter can tell me what to do 
 
I dont care who you've been kissing on these days 
It's out of my hands 
and in my mouth with such a pleasant taste 
I need a beer to wash it all away without a trace 
And then i'll drink 23 more 
To wipe this stupid smile off my fucking face 
 
I'm tired of sleeping with myself 
I'm tired, all those drinks and drugs no longer help 
I'm tired of lying about not thinking of you 
Maybe my friend Peter can tell me what to do

MY STANDARD BREAK FROM LIFE

 I've got a regular problem 
So my standard break from life is in order 
I'm having trouble making sentences 
I'm older but I don't feel any smarter 
You see I don't know what I said to you 
And now you're pissed at you know who 
And I guess I deserve it 
I wish I could waste my time without wasting all your time 
I try to leave a good impression 
But it's hard when my obsession's in a wine glass 
And when you're only 23 
It's not attractive to complain about your sore back 
Yes I can bitch until my eyes are blue 
And you're in bed with someone new 
And I guess you deserve him 
Wish I could waste my time without wasting all your time 
You say I'm fixable 
A classic case, lack of will 
I say I don't wanna try 
I'd rather stay here all night 
 
I've got a motivation problem 
So my standard break from life is getting longer 
Spent over 30 hours in this bed 
In two days, I guess I could've phoned her 
But now that I'm awake 
I'd rather take a drink 
And walk down to the lake 
And beg the sky for lightning bolts 
I can't waste my time without wasting all your time 
You say it's fixable 
A classic case, lack of will 
I say I don't wanna try 
I'd rather sit here all night

I fall in love with you

In the velvet darkness 
Of the blackest night, burning bright 
There's a guiding star 
No matter what or who you are 
 
There's a light 
Over at the Frankenstein place 
There's a light 
Burning in the fireplace 
There's a light 
In the darkness of everybody's life 
 
The darkness must glow 
Down the river of night's dreaming 
Flow morphia slow 
Let the sun and light 
come streaming into my life, 
into my life 
 
There's a light 
Over at the Frankenstein place 
There's a light 
Burning in the fireplace 
There's a light 
In the darkness of everybody's life

 I drained this lake looking for corpses Dusted for prints, pried up the floorboards Pieces of planes and black box recorders Don't lie And I've been preoccupied with these sick, sick senses That sense DNA on barbed wire fences Maybe someday I'll find me a suspect That has no alibi New Year's Eve was as boring as heaven I watched flies fuck on channel 11 There was no one to kiss, there was nothing to drink Except some old rotten milk someone left in the sink And there's no ring on the phone anymore There's no reason to call I passed out on the floor Smoked myself stupid and drank my insides raisin dry But at the right place at the right time I'll be dead wrong and you'll be just fine And I won't have to quit doing fucked up shit For anyone but me And at the right place at the right time It will have been worth it to stand in line And you won't have to stop Saying I love cops for anyone but me Your private eye

QUEEN OF PAIN

 There's a fire forming, not too far from here 
Along the east coast maybe, it resides in you, my dear 
Worn out on our courtesy, we've made our curtain calls 
Like vampire bats deprived of blood, into the New York City that we crawl 
 
And you've got a funny way of showing off your bathoom surgery 
You said you were just cooling down from plans of leaving me 
There's something I should tell you, for we may not have much time 
I've never met arms like yours 
 
The stars at night are big and bright 
Deep in your eyes, Miss Vincent 
You told me once I made you smile 
But we both know damn well I didn't 
I'm not much of a jester, but I'd test poisoned food for you 
Your majesty, you're royal blue 
I'm royalty, my king of pain 
 
There's a hard rain falling, flooding your attic, it's clear 
Can't put out the fire that resides in you, my dear 
There's something I should tell you, for we may not have much time 
I've never seen scars like yours 
 
The stars at night are big and bright 
Deep in your eyes, Miss Vincent 
You told me once I made you smile 
But we both know damn well I didn't 
I'm not much of a jester, but I'd test poisoned food for you 
Your majesty, you're royal blue 
I'm royalty, my king of pain

RADIO

 Shaking like a dog shittin' razorblades, waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me I'm waking up all alone, waking up so relieved while you're taking your time with apologies, I'm making my plans for revenge Red eyes on orange horizons If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge I'd drive straight off the edge Taking your own life with boredom, I'm taking my own life with wine it helps you to rule out the sorrow, it helps me to empty my mind Making the most of a bad time I'm smoking the brains from my head Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red This kettle is seeing red I've got a big fat fuckin' bone to pick with you my darling In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you, plugged in and ready to fall Shaking like a dog shittin' razorblades, waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me Waking up all alone, waking up so relieved while you're taking your time with apologies, I'm planning out my revenge Red eyes on orange horizons If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge I'm seeing red I've got a big fat fuckin' bone to pick with you my darling In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you, plugged in and ready to fall Plugged in and ready to fall Plugged in and ready to fall Plugged in and ready to fall

ROOFTOPS

 [Originally by Hot Water Music] 
 
I've got the scars to remind me. I've watched the clocks go around. I've walked myself through some days that have put me where I am. In another time, in another place all things might have been in place. But for now I'm finding myself right here standing on a rooftop screaming. Hey world are you listening... listening to me? I'm here and I'm hurting to begin again. It's another time, it's another place and we are making more old days. But for now I'm finding myself out here standing on a doorstep screaming. Hey world are you listening... listening to me? I'm here and I'm hurting to begin again. Hey world I'm ready to listen (Lurch smokes weed) and learn something new. I'm here and I'm willing to get myself through

SADIE

 You're on your own my little nightmare 
You cannot stay here 
It's far too bright for you 
If they attack, you just lay there 
Play dead there 
It's your only hope of pulling through 
 
In seconds they seem 
Like a lifetimes of dreams 
Recurring a dream that can't come true 
I pin it all on you after all you've been through 
 
Said it Gee, she's crazy see 
That's what the white ghost said 
Now it's losing me 
Now you're losing every opportunity 
To put us all away 
 
Go run along my little nightmare 
Your job is done here 
You scared them all to death 
If they allowed them 
Just sit there, just smile death 
Make them thankful for every breath 
 
The sentence may seem like a lifetime of scream 
That's curbing the blood they found on you 
Your knives and clothing too 
Charlie's broken 22 
 
Said it Gee, she's crazy see 
That's what the white ghost said 
Now it's losing me 
Now you're losing every opportunity 
 
They found you and shipped you up a river the same way 
You're bound and gagged, shot and stabbed 
You tried to set them free but they've thrown away the keys 
 
 I think that if I found a god to me that was so beautiful that I'd do anything for him. I'd anything for god. Even murder, if I believed it was god, how could it not be right? Because he said it was. I have no remorse for the killer inside of me, I have more to do

 Choking on the thought of leaving Drinking to keep from sobbing 4pm, 4 dollar pints SFO the time and price With all my happiness aborted The PA painfully starts boarding I sink deep, 30 thousand feet Into my window seat, electric chair And I was drinking you goodbye A heart floats in the bay From sour home Chicago I hear it beating far away There's no telling what I'll do If I don't return to you Hopeful thoughts of soon returning can't put out my stomach burning Plastic wings and plastic smiles Unsalted peanuts stretch my miles Choking on the thought of leaving Drinking to keep from heaving 5pm, 5 dollar pints Hellbound Airlines time and price And I was drinking you goodbye A heart floats in the bay From sour home Chicago I hear it beating far away There's no telling what I'll do If I don't return to you I was drinking you goodbye A heart floats in the bay From sour home Chicago I hear it beating far away There's no telling what I'll do If I don't return to you

SHE TOOK HIM TO THE LAKE

 Do you remember the story of the boy and his first date? She took him to the lake and he fell in love She spent one summer waking up between his arms She told him how good that felt, told him he was the one And then she went away, his calls were not returned He went to see her but her eyes were burning a different stare The focus was somewhere else And that feeling had somehow disappeared Do you remember when they both drove out of state? Stealing kisses behind her cousins back, with a love so strong tell me who could wait When it seems so right and it feels so right Man, it had to be right When it seems so right and it feels so right Man, it had to be right gotta be right When it seems so right and it feels so right Man, it had to be right But then she went away and she's not coming back and I'm pretty sure that boy is staying in tonight

SORRY ABOUT THAT

 It hasn't been that long Since we drank to the sunset, until it was gone And down with it went our pain and fear As we slowly broke contact more and more with every beer And we passed out in each other's arms Both admitting we'd never felt better Never felt so warm But awoke in each other's eyes Without wearing a stitch of clothing We were both deeply in disguise And maybe I just set aside The fact that you were broken hearted In my own special selfish way And if I hadn't set aside The fact that you were broken hearted Hell knows where your heart would be today Maybe with me It seems like it's been so long Since we kissed through the darkness Until it was dawn Up with it came our pain and fear That we'd already lost each other We both knew that the end was near Maybe I just set aside The fact that you were broken hearted In my own special selfish way And if I hadn't set aside The fact that you were broken hearted Hell knows where your heart would be today Maybe with me Maybe with me Maybe with me Maybe with me Maybe with me Maybe with me

STEAMER TRUNK

 Why you turned out the way you did That thunderstorm is still crashing in your cranium Find that all these funny faces look the same I know who's to blame But I swore I wouldn't say Its time that I got moving on As you're still burning the dress you wore to senior prom Try to forget how you've been touched I loved you so I told you But it didn't matter much And I'm trying to figure out What you're all about these days I don't have much to say to you And I've been drunker than a skunk Ever since the day I left you With your darkest secret safely packed away Up in my steamer trunk Why I turned out the way I did Someone somewhere dropped me on my cranium I'm sorry can you repeat what you just said My short term memory is gone But my long term's far from dead And I'm trying to figure out What you're all about these days I don't have much to say to you I've been drunker than a skunk Ever since the day I left you With you're darkest secret safely packed away Up in my steamer trunk In my steamer trunk And I'm trying to figure out What you're all about these days I don't have much to say to you I've been swearing like a sailor Ever since the day that I left her With her darkest secret safely packed away up in my steamer trunk

SUN DIALS

 You were like a toilet bowl at the end of the rainbow 
Something like a pot of gold stuck under my pillow 
Keeping me up at night you kept my head spinning 
And wishing there were windows to throw you from 
Throw you from 
Day or night 
Fuck if I know 
Hard to tell with no fucking window 
And sundials 
What good are sundials once the sun is gone? 
What are you good for? 
 
And we laid in my bed like a train wreck 
And we both got laid like concrete 
And we fought like soldiers 
But we died.. we died like flies 
Day or night 
Fuck if I know 
Hard to tell with no fucking window 
And sundials 
What good are sundials once the sun is gone? 
What are you good for?

THE METRO

 [Originally by Berlin] 
 
I'm alone 
Sitting with my empty glass. 
My four walls 
Follow me through my past 
I was on a Paris train 
I emerged in London rain, 
And you were waiting there 
Swimming through appologies. 
 
I remember searching for the perfect words. 
I was hoping you might change your mind. 
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me. 
Riding on the Metro. 
 
You wore white, 
Smiling as you took my hand. 
So removed 
We spoke of wintertime in France. 
Minutes passed with shallow words. 
Years have passed and still the hurt. 
I can see you now 
Smiling as you pulled away. 
 
I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand. 
 I'll love you always filled my eyes. 
I remember a night we walked along the Sein 
Riding on the Metro 
 
I remember a feeling coming over me 
The soldier turned then looked away 
I remember hating you for loving me 
Riding on the Metro

kiss you one last time 
before we brought the horse's in before the storm of '59'!

WHILE YOU'RE WAITING

 There's a hope in my head 
That's been cut and bleed 
Dry as your bloodshot eyes 
And there's smoke in the air 
And it's soon to clear 
Revealing our demise 
There are some who say 
That it's a okay 
If it makes you feel all right 
It's just way too bad 
Now you're worse than sad 
All locked up there in side 
 
And I don't know how you feel 
But I'll make you a deal 
If you'll make it out alive 
My shoulders and ears 
Are all yours my dear 
I Hope it comes as no surprise 
You've been known to say 
That you're a okay 
When you're feeling sick inside 
I just want you to know 
I got no place to go 
Until the day you die 
 
While you're waiting 
Be thankful for your fingers 
I'll be fading 
With the colors of your pictures 
'I'm not crying wolf,' you whisper, 
'I'm really dead this time... 
I'm really dead this time' 
 
There's a hope in my head 
That's been cut and bleed 
Dry as your bloodshot eyes 
And there's smoke in the air

While you're waiting, 
Be thankful for your fingers, 
I'll be fading 
With the colors of your pictures 
'I'm not crying wolf,' you whisper, 
'I'm really dead this time... 
I'm really dead this time' 
 
They locked you up 
They threw away the key 
Sutured your mouth shut 
Murdered your family 
Right before your eyes 
What could you do? 
Right before your eyes 
They took it all from you 
 
Your contemplating 
You hanging from your ceiling 
Can't help hating 
You for having that feeling 
I'm not joking when I tell you 
I'd miss you all the time 
I already miss you all the time

 

ALKALINE TRIO
YOU'RE DEAD

 What the hell is your name And can you explain this mess It seems your playing a game Where you only know how to take out the best Cause if assholes could fly This place would be busier than O'Hare There's proof in the sky It's as thick as our skulls yet it's thinner than air I have something to say If the chip off your shoulder should fall to your chest Get it off right away Cause if you don't then it won't be in peace that you rest It's just a matter of time That we all go away to a better place I'm told It all sounds well and fine But without you around I feel nothing but cold And I now have nothing But your heartbeat in my head And a photograph of my traveling friend And I became nothing when I found you were dead When I found out I'd never see you again And all the time they took talking in circles To get them off the hook would take miracle workers We're nowhere near prepared there's no way of knowing Why don't they just admit they're scared Cause its already showing 

ALKALINE TRIO
YOU'VE GOT SO FAR TO GO

 Soon ends our stay here and it's been fun So tonight I'll raise my glass to us 'cause we've talked so much I think we filled this ashtray twice, and I'm pretty sure we emptied every bottle in the place, so Let's walk home, let's be afraid I wanna grab you by the arms and kiss you so hard Let's do it right under the streetlight I want it now, somehow I forgot how Way to go, way to go Forgot you've got so far to go Way to go, way to go Forgot you've got so far to go I heard everybody's voice cut out when you spoke And I watched all the lights go dim when your eyes opened Well I can't believe you showed up, what do I do now? It's last call, time to go But before we say goodnight Let's walk home, let's be afraid I wanna grab you by the arms and kiss you so hard Let's do it right under the streetlight I want it now, somehow I forgot how Way to go, way to go Forgot you've got so far to go Way to go, way to go Forgot you've got so far to go Forgot you've got so far, you've got so far to go Forgot you've got so far, you've got so far to go Forgot you've got so far, you've got so far to go Forgot you've got so far, you've got so far to go
