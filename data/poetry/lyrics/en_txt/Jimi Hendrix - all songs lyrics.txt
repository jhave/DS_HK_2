1983... (A MERMAN I SHOULD TURN TO BE)

 Hurrah i awake from yesterday 
Alive but the war is here to stay 
So my love catherina and me 
Decide to take our last walk 
Through the noise to the sea 
Not to die but to be re born 
Away from a life so battered and torn.... 
Forever... 
Oh say can you see its really such a mess 
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest 
Giant pencil and lip stick tube shaped things 
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain 
And the arctic stains 
>From silver blue to bloody red 
As our feet find the sand 
And the sea is strait ahead.. 
Strait ahead..... 
Well its too bad 
That our friends 
Cant be with us today 
Well thats too bad 
 The machine 
That we built 
Would never save us 
That's what they say 
(That's why they aint coming with us today) 
And they also said 
 It's impossible for man 
To live and breath underwater.. 
Forever was their main complaint 
(Yeah) 
And they also threw this in my face: 
They said 
Anyway 
You know good well 
It would be beyond the will of God 
And the grade of the King 
(Grace of the King yeah yeah) 
 
So my darling and I 
Make love in the sand 
To salute the last moment 
Ever on dry land 
Our machine has done its work 
Played its part well 
Without a scratch on our bodies 
And we bid it farewell 
 
Starfish and giant foams 
Greet us with a smile 
Before our heads go under 
We take a last look 
At the killing noise 
Of the out of style... 
The out of style, out of style

51ST ANNIVERSARY

 For fifty years they ve been married 
They can t wait for their fifty first 
To roll around, yeah, roll around. 
For thirty years they ve been married 
And now they re old and happy 
And they settle down, ha ha 
Settle down, yeah. 
For twenty years they ve been married 
And they did everything that could be done 
You know, they have their fun. 
 
And then you come along and talk about it: 
 So you, you say you wanna be married, 
I m gonna change your mind. 
Oh, gotta change it. 
That was the good side baby 
Here comes the best side. 
For ten years they ve been married 
A thousand kids went around homeless 
 Cause their Mom was a louse 
Daddy s down at the whisky house. 
That ain t all, 
For three years they ve been married 
They don t get along so good, 
They re tired of each other. 
You know how that goes, 
She got another lover. 
Hah, same old thing. 
So now you re seventeen 
You run around hangin out 
And having your fun 
Life for you has just begun baby. 
 
And then you come sayin : 
 So you, you say you wanna be married. 
Oh, baby, tryin to put me on a chain 
Ain t that some shame? 
You must be losin your weak little mind. 
I ain t ready to get married, 
I ain t ready. 
I m gonna change your mind. 
Ooh, look out baby. 
Auh, I ain t ready to get tied down 
I ain t ready, I ain t ready now 
Let me live a little while longer 
Let me live, let me live a little while longer 
So I can finish talking, 
Let me get back to my groooove . . . 


 

JIMI HENDRIX
AIN'T NO TELLING

 Well there ain't no hu 
Ain't no telling baby

But I pray it will be tomorrow. 
 
Well the sunrise 
Is burnin' my eyes baby 
Well now I must leave now 
But I really hope to see you tomorrow. 
 
Yeah well my house is oh, such a million miles away 
The feelin' there always hangs up my day 
Oh Cleopatra, she's driving me insane 
She's tryin' to put my body in her brain 
So uh, just uh, kiss me goodbye, just to ease the pain. 
 
Sing it, hah, sing it, hah ! 
 
Ain't no, ain't no telling baby

ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER

 (Bob Dylan) 
 
There must be some kind of way out of here 
Said the joker to the theif 
There's too much confusion 
I can't get no relief 
Business men they drink my wine 
Plowmen dig my earth 
No one will level on the line 
Nobody of it is worth 
 
No reason to get exited 
The thief he kindly spoke 
There are many here among us 
Who feel that life is but a joke 
But you and I we've been through that 
And this is not our fate 
So let us stop talking falsely now 
The hour's getting late 
Hey 
 
All along the watchtower 
The princess kept the view 
While all the women came 
And went bare feet servants too 
Outside in the cold distance 
A wild cat did growl 
Two riders were aproaching 
And the wind began to howl 
 
Hey 
Oh 
All along the watchtower 
Hear you sing around the watch 
Gotta beware gotta beware I will 
Yeah, Oh baby 
All along the watchtower

ANGEL

 Angel came down from heaven yesterday 
She stayed with me just long enough to recue he 
And she told me a story yesterday, 
about the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea 
And then she spread her wings high over me 
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow 
 
And I said fly on my sweet angel, 
fly on through the sky, 
fly on my sweet angel, 
tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side 
 
Sure enough this morning came unto me 
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise 
And my angel sha said unto 
 today is the day for you to rise, 
take my hand, you're gonna be my man, 
you're gonna rise 
And she took high over yonder 
 
And I said fly on my sweet angel, 
fly on through the sky, 
fly on my sweet angel, 
forever I will be by your side 


 

JIMI HENDRIX
ASTRO MAN

 Here I come to save the day 
 
A little boy inside a dream just the other day 
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away 
A hand came out from heaven and pinned a badge on his chest 
It said Get out there, man, and do your best 
 
They call him Astro Man 
And he's flyin' higher than 
That faggot Superman ever could 
 
Oh, they call him Cosmic Nut 
And he's twice as dense as Donald Duck 
And he'll try his best toscrew you up 
The rest of your mind 
Oh, look out! My guitars 
 
Astro Man, flyin' across the sky two times higher 
than that old faggot Superman ever, ever could 
Ever could 
 
There he goes, there he goes 
Where he stops, no one knows 
There he goes, there he goes 
He's tryin' to, tryin' to blow out the rest of your mind 
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind 
Talkin' about lookin' for peace of mind 
Astro Man will leave it in pieces 
Have you put our trouble behind him 
Make you fly around in pieces 
Yeah, blow out the rest of your mind 
Astro Man will blow out the rest of your mind 
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind

BELLY BUTTON WINDOW

 Well. I'm up here in this womb 
I'm looking all around 
Well, I'm looking out my belly button window 
And I see a whole lot of frowns 
And I'm wondering if they don't want me around 
 
What seems to be the fuzz out there? 
Just what seems to be the hang? 
'Cause you know if ya just don't want me this time around, 
yeah I'll be glad to go back to Spirit Land 
And even take a longer rest, 
before I'm coming down the chute again 
Man, I sure remember the last time, baby 
They were stlll hawkin' about me then 
So if you don't want me now, 
Make up your mind, where or when 
If you don't want me now, 
Give or take, you only got two hundred days 
'Cause I ain't coming down this way too much more again 
 
You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills 
But I think you're just a little too late 
So I'm coming down into this world, daddy 
Regardless of love and hate 
And I'm gonna sit up in your bed, mama 
And just a grin right in your face 
And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates, 
and say I hope I'm not too late 
 
So if there's any questions, 
make up your mind 
'Cause you better give or take 
Questions in your mind 
Give it a take, 
you only got two hundered days 
 
Way up into this womb 
looking all around 
Sure's dark in here 
And I'm looking out my belly button window 
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns 
And I'm wondering if they want me around

BLACK GOLD

 Black is Gold is pure 
And true kings of this Earth. 
 
1. 
 
So I say it s up to us to straighten 
out this mess... 
We got to go through Hell... 
And then that s the last of this 
miserable test... 
 
2. 
 
Black must be Bold 
Because it s Gold and true 
kings of this world... 
So let them go to the moon. 
Yes let them go to Mars. 
Because deep down inside 
they re really from the stars. 
 
3. 
 
That s why they don t want 
us to mix...just the way 
the Word of God had said. 
So let them go to Saturn...that s 
where they ll learn instead. 
Because Black and White 
together is right... 
And White by itself is 
an egotistic elf. 
 
4. 
 
So they show you how to 
kill...and if you don t 
they will. 
What do they know about 
happiness... 
How can they about life... 
They just got lost in Space. 
So when they landed, 
Atlantis cried. 
 
So if they re so alone try 
to make them feel at home. 
So let them fetch you fire wood. 
And let them nibble on the bone. 
So invent a word called Love. 
And then they blame our mistakes on God. 
Don t you know how lonely they must be. 
So many light years from home. 
Hey Soulful people I m calling. 
Don t be no more slaves. 
Because God will protect us 
when it comes to doomsday. 
Realize before it s too late... 
that NO ONE on Earth will escape. 
We are the kings of Earth. 
And AXIS gonna put them slaves... 
They killed so many worlds before. 
But they will pass sentence upon themselves... 
When the Earth opens up...will 
they be saved from our hell. 
 
I feel the TRUTH of LIFE. 
We better all realize... 
People like me and you 
We feel so bad, don t know 
what to do... they keep us 
High low on drugs. 
And they got us making their Rugs... 
As we go dripping blood. 
But the Sun knows as 
the wind blows and the 
fire grows towards the 
far shores and the water 
foams to make steamed 
Bones of all of those who don t belive that... 
Black is Gold is the kings of this world. 
We all better get our places 
before God tells us to our 
face WE ARE...PAST the Human Race. 
Let s pray that we all agree 
we got to straighten out the family tree. 
Life is for you and me togather. 
That s the way it was meant to be. 
White man watch your mouth 
because our Drums, they face the South. 
And you can t kill the God 
that kept you alive between 
the poles of the north and south. 
You better adjust your place 
in this world...Before your 
hair, it starts to curl...and the 
yellow, red, and Black of this 
world will tear your ass and soul apart. 
 
Where is he coming from ? 
from Heaven where 1,000,000 
worlds are one. 
Where is he going to ? 
He s going to make contact 
with the living and the dead... 
Here comes Black Gold... 
Gather round young and old... 
He s going to be felt by the 
Timid and the Bold... 
within a wink of an eye, 
 
With the wink of an eye 
Egos swell, bust and die... 
Kingdoms fall and cry... 
With the wink of an eye... 
With the wink of an eye 
a new born baby cries... 
and a 100 soldiers die with 
the wink of an eye.

BLEEDING HEART

 People, people Hear me, people 
Do you know what it means to be left alone? 
People, people Hear me, people 
Do you know what it means to be left alone? 
Without a love you can call 
Not even a love you can call your own? 
Understanding, understanding 
Lord, that s all in the world I really need 
Understanding and a little bit of love, baby 
That s all in the world I need. 
Misunderstanding and a no good woman 
They both cause my heart to bleed. 
Every morning 
I can hear out my window when the blues call my name 
I can hear the blues call my name, baby 
Every morning 
Every morning, every morning 
You can hear the willows weep and moan for me 
Oh, every morning. 
You can hear the willows weep and moan for me 
My love has left me, yeah 
That s what cause my heart to bleed. 
That s all that cause my heart to bleed 
Bleeding heart 
Yeah, it s too bad we had to part 
Lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, lord, baby 
Please come back home, baby 
Please come back home, baby 
So, my heart wont bleed no more, baby 
O oh, come on home, baby 
 


 

JIMI HENDRIX
BOLD AS LOVE

 Anger he smiles, towering in shiny metallic purple armour 
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him 
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground 
 
Blue are the life giving waters taken for granted, 
They quietly understand 
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready, 
But wonder why the fight is on 
 
But they're all bold as love, yes, they're all bold as love 
Yeah, they're all bold as love 
Just ask the axis 
 
My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war and 
ribbons of euphoria 
Orange is young, full of daring, 
But very unsteady for the first go round 
My yellow in this case is not so mellow 
In fact I'm trying to say it's frigthened like me 
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, eh, 
Giving my life to a rainbow like you 
But, I'm eh , yeah, I'm bold as love 
Yeah, yeah 
Well I'm bold, bold as love (hear me talking, girl) 
I'm bold as love 
Just ask the axis (he knows everything) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

BURNING OF THE MIDNIGHT LAMP

 The morning is dead 
And the day is, too 
There's nothing left here to meet me 
But the velvet moon 
All my loneliness I have felt today 
It's like a little more than enough 
To make a man throw himself away 
 
And I continue 
To burn the midnight lamp 
Alone 
 
Now the smiling portrait of you 
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall 
It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at all 
It's just the ever falling dust 
That makes it so hard for me to see 
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor 
Facing coldly towards the door 
 
I continue 
To burn the midnight lamp 
Lord, alone 
 
Loneliness is such a drag 
 
So here I sit to face 
That same old fire place 
Gettin' ready for the same old explosion 
Goin' through my mind 
And soon enough time will tell, 
About the circus in the wishing well 
And someone who will buy and sell for me 
Someone to toll my bell 
 
But I continue 
To burn the midnight lamp 
Lord, alone 
Darlin' can't ya hear me callin' you? 
So lonely 
Gonna have to blow my mind 
Lonely 


 

JIMI HENDRIX
CASTLES MADE OF SAND

 Down the street you can hear her scream you're a disgrace 
As she slams the door in his drunken face 
And now he stands outside 
And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool 
He cries Oh, girl you must be mad, 
What happened to the sweet love you and me had? 
Against the door he leans and starts a scene, 
And his tears fall and burn the garden green 
 
And so castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually 
 
A little indian brave who before he was ten, 
Played wargames in the woods with his indian friends 
And he built up a dream that when he grew up 
He would be a fearless warrior indian cheif 
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until 
Tomorrow he would sing his first warsong and fight his first battle 
But something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night 
 
And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually 
 
There was a young girl, whos heart was a frown 
'Cause she was crippled for life, 
and she couldn't speak a sound 
And she wished and prayed she could stop living, 
So she decided to die 
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore 
And to her legs she smiled you won't hurt me no more 
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say 
 look a golden winged ship is passing my way 
 
And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going... 
 
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually

CRYSTAL BALL

 As I looked into my crystal ball... 
there was formed a tragedy. 
Oh but there s nothing to worry about... 
It was just a flash from my memory. 
Well it seems that the Holiday Wheel..., 
you know, the one that was between Earth 
and the moon...Well any way, there was 
2,000,000 killed...bodies floating in the 
afternoon... 
 
Explosions, 1,000 or more, announcing 
tidal waves and Hurricanes... 
And down on Earth we lost 3 continents. 
Their fiery soul snuffed out by 
Nature s ice and rains... 
 
And pieces of my life...floating, 
still soaring through space... 
But my sons and their wives 
landed on Mars to start another race... 
 
As I gazed upon my crystal ball, 
there formed a cloud of jealousy. 
But there s nothing to feel sad about... 
By this time, it s due for only history. 
Well, it seems that the Chambers of the 
Gods were being emptied for good. 
Why would such Heavenly beings want 
to desert Earth ? 
But as I watched I understood. 
 
As the clouds turned to a Jealous 
Green, which was concieved in the heart 
of man...the people didn t respect 
the help of the Gods. Instead they turned against 
immortal man. As they tried to defy, they 
died, into the wicked pits of Hell. 
 
Diana wept a tear after we made love 
and said: My Earthly Darling, I must bid 
you farewell...The fate of your mud brothers ... 
As pieces of my life...floating, 
still soaring in Space... 
She could have been my wife 
But her time, I didn t dare wish 
to waste. 
 
As I stared into my crystal ball, 
there was formed a tearing of hearts. 
Ego Armies marched antly onto view 
only to be blown apart. 
 
As the sun whispered its secret 
through space...to men thinking the false pride 
opposite...telling them that it was 
such a disgrace to think that men were 
the ruler of it. Well you know 
how the story goes...the sun they thought 
was their circling slave... 
round and round and round the 
table she goes. Some carried 
the thought right to their grave... 
And I smell the scorch of the 
burnt out minds...who searched 
for the hurting truth of space. And the 
dizziness they felt inside... 
reflected off the spinning 
slave pebble earth... 
 
As fragments of my life... 
Some floating, some soaring in Space 
Collections of my soul 
will turn complete only as time will age. 
 
As my tears drop on my crystal ball, 
Magnifies the reflections of Christ. 
As I blink, His angels take him away. 
What he said, man tries to self 
 help from God. As reward, he 
wipes our blood from his eyes... 
And the cross that he would 
use for his throne represents 
not life but death. Is this the way 
all heroes go ?...Carrying the first necklace 
of death... 
His preaching the belief 
of eternal Happiness to rest. 
Or were his angels just UFOs 
vapor trails lead from 
another light year land... 
Or was it really tomorrow s 
awakening day dream...blemished 
by the smudgy finger prints of man... 
 
And slivers of my life...floating, 
still soaring in space... 
And spirits of Bee hives 
even they find a resting place. 
 
As I wander through my crystal ball, 
I suddenly ride upon the waves of sound. 
I see platforms of launching 
pads even before the first blade of 
grass turned brown. 
 
And I taste their tunnels through 
the sky...As the axis turns in its womb. 
Frozen flowers and animals try to 
hold positions they had before 
their morning bloomed... 
And I follow the last rocket up 
to the libraries of the moon s meadows.

HOUSE BURNING DOWN

 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey 
 
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red 
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down 
Down, down, down. 
 
Well I asked my friend where is that black smoke comin' from ? 
He just coughed and changed the subject and said oh wa I think it might 
snow some 
So I left him sippin' his tea an' I jumped in my chariot 
And rode off to see just why and who could it be this time. 
 
Sisters and brothers daddys mothers standin' 'round cryin' 
When I reached the scene the flames were makin' a ghostly whine 
So I stood on my horse's back an' I screamed without a crack 
I say oh baby why'd you burn your brother's house down ? 
 
Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! 
 
Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord 
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down 
Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord 
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down down. 
 
Well someone stepped from the crowd he was nineteen miles high 
He shouts retired and disgusted so we paint red through the sky 
I said the truth is straight ahead so don't burn yourself instead 
Try to learn instead of burn, hear what I say, yeah, yeah. 
 
So I fin'ly rode away but I'll never forget that day 
'Cause when I reached the valley I looked way down cross the way 
A giant boat from space landed with eerie grace 
And came and taken all the dead away. 
 
Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! 
 
What'd I say. 
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord 
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down 
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord 
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down 
Look at the sky, look at the sky. 
 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
Oh baby

You thought they were all kidding you 
You used to laugh about 
Everybody else that was hanging out 
Now you don't talk so loud 
Now you don't seem so proud 
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal 
 
How does it feel

To be on your own 
In no direction home

MAY I WHISPER IN YOUR EAR

 May I whisper in your ear 
from my heart so you ll clearly hear... 
There are people so dear... 
They re like Children... 
Naked in a cold world... 
Beautiful children 
in an old world... 
 
May I take you away 
from the evils of today 
to the dreams of tomorrow. 
You know that Heaven... 
Has no sorrow. 
You know that Heaven... 
Has no tomorrow. 
 
Hear the Sound of the Magic Drums... 
Hearts are beating for the Sun... 
Sending Evil on the run... 
Now watch the wind... 
 
 
Look over yonder... 
Here comes some news... 
Coming down like lightning... 
Straight for me and you. 
People of destruction 
your time is out of date... 
People who s living crooked, 
better start getting straight. 
 
I ve been through some changes, 
a whole lot of re arranges... 
Been through some ups and downs, 
and whole lot of turn arounds. 
I been on the shelf and even killed myself... 
1,000 times ago and maybe 1,000 
times more. 
 
She said she comes from Ice land... 
I told her I was from the west. 
She took me to the snow capped mountains... 
and then she put me through the test... 
We walked across the glacier, 
the horses stayed behind... 
and as we laid between the 
frozen Vallies we kissed 
for the very first time. 
and now we re stuck together. 
 
It was too long ago. 
But it seems like...years ago... 
since I felt the warm hello of the Sun. 
Lately things seem a little colder... 
The wind, it seems to get a little bolder. 
 
 
Forget of my name 
Remember it only as a hand shake, 
introduction to my belief which is God. 
Ride instead the Waves of my Interpreture, 
Music, sound 
Hynotic if you choose 
But truth and life 
regardless of your questionable timid compromises 
which I intend to erase. 
Which I will erase without hint of reward 
as I am only a messenger 
and you a Sheep in process of evolution 
Almost at Death with yourself 
and on the staircase of Birth. 
Soon you may almost forget the smell of your family... 


 

JIMI HENDRIX
MAY THIS BE LOVE

 Waterfall 
Nothing can harm me at all 
My worries seem so very small 
With my waterfall 
I can see 
My rainbow calling me 
Through the misty breeze 
Of my waterfall 
Some people say 
Day dreamings for all the, huh, 
Lazy minded fools 
With nothin' else to do 
So let them laugh, laugh at me 
So just as long as I have you 
To see me through 
I have nothing to lose 
'Long as I have you 
Waterfall 
Don't ever change your ways 
Fall with me for a million days 
Oh, my waterfall

MY FRIEND

 Hey, look out for my glass up there, man! 
That's my drink, man, that's my drink, alright... 
Make it a double, or eh... 
Somebody has to sing 
Some body will sing? 
Somebody will sing, right? 
(I don't know!) 
 
Y'all pass me that bottle, 
And I'll sing you all a real song 
Yeah! 
Let me get my key, ahum! 
 
Well, I'm looking through Harlem 
my stomach squeal just a little more 
A stagecouch full of feathers and footprints, 
pulls up to soap&uml;box door 
Now a lady with a pearl&uml;handled necktie 
Tied to the driver's fence 
breathes in my face, 
bourbon and coke possessed words 
& quot;Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell, 
or was it just an accident? 
(You know how I felt then, and so:) 
 
Before I could ask was it the East or West side? 
my feet they howled in pain 
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep, 
but not as deep in my mind as the rain 
And as they pulled away I could see her words 
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent 
Well I picked them up, brushed them off, 
to see what they say, 
and you wouldn't believe: 
 Come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle, 
and bring along the bottle and a president' 
 
And eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby 
Especially when your only friend, 
talks, sees, looks and feels like you, 
and you do just the same as him 
(Gets very lonely up this road, baby) 
(Yeah, hmmm, yeah) 
(Got more to say!) 
 
Well I'm riding through LA (huh), 
on a bicycle built for fools 
And I seen one of my old buddies 
And he say, you don't look the way you usually do 
I say, well, some people look like a coin box 
He say, look like you ain't got no coins to spare 
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this: 
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone, 
and combed this breath right out of my hair 
And sometimes it's not so easy 
Especially when your only friend 
talk, sees, looks and feels like you, 
and you do just the same as him 
 
just got out of a Scandinavian jail, 
and I'm on my way straight home to you 
But I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror, 
to make sure my friend's here with me too 
And you know good well I don't drink coffee, 
so you fill my cup full of sand 
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom 
Sharing lipstick around the broken edge 
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on 
And your cat he attacked me from his pill&uml;box ledge 
And I thought you were my friend too 
Man, my shadow comes in line before you 
I'm finding out that it's eh not so easy 
Specially when your only friend 
Talks, looks, sees and feels like you, 
and you do the same just like him 
 
(Lord it's so lonely here, hmmm, yeah) 
Yeah! 
(Pass me that bottle over there...) 
Yeah, yeah, okay...

NIGHT BIRD FLYING

 She's just a nigh bird flyin' throught the night

Sail on, sail on 
Well, she's flyin' down to me 
But, 'til tomorrow got to set her free 
Set her free

All we got is one precious night 
Throw your blues and shoes and things 
And lay it down under the bed

Better hear what I say, yeah 
Oh, carry me home 
Please take me through your dreams

ONE RAINY WISH

 Golden rose, the color of the dream I had 
Not too long ago 
A misty blue and the lillac too 
A never to grow old. 
 
A there you were under the tree of song 
Sleeping so peacefully 
In your hand a flower played 
A waiting there for me. 
 
I have never 
Laid eyes on you 
Not before 
This timeless day 
But you woke and whoa 
Smiled my name 
And you stole 
My heart away 
A stole my heart away little girl, yeah 
All right ! 
 
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had 
Not too long ago 
Misty blue and lillac too 
A never to grow old. 
 
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had 
Misty blue and lillac too 
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had 
Misty blue and lillac too 
Gold and rose, gold are rose, gold and rose. 
 
It's only a dream 
I'd love to tell somebody about this dream 
The sky was filled with a thousand stars 
While the sun kissed the mountains blue 
And eleven moons played across rainbows 
Above me and you. 
Gold and rose the color of the velvet walls surround us.

ROOM FULL OF MIRRORS

 I used to live in a room full of mirrors 
All I could see was me 
Then I take my spirit and I smash my mirrors 
And now the whole world is here for me to see 
Now I m searching for my love to be 
 
A broken glass was solvin my brain 
Cut and screamin crowdin in my head 
A broken glass was loud in my brain 
It used to fall on my dreams and cut me in my bed 
It used to fall on my dreams and cut me in my bed 
I say making love was strange in my bed 


 

JIMI HENDRIX
SHE'S SO FINE

 She walks with a bell clock round her neck 
So the hippies think she's in with time 
Time... 
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck 
Branches attack me from her neck 
She's so fine 
She's so very very fine 
The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes 
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind 
Mind... 
Morning sign sounds just like a lark 
All these signs are always a start 
She's so fine 
She's so very very fine 
When I veer I get so near 
But so far far far away

The ground was hard underneath her her 
Ahhhahhh

Have you heard, baby 
A whole lot of peoples coming right on down 
 
Communication, yeah

And don't give a damn, baby 
If your hair is short or long, huh

Everybody is dancing in the street 
Do what you know, don't be slow 
You gotta practice what you preach 
'Cause it's time for you and me 
Come to face reality (it sounds like he says fake reality ) 
 
Forget about the past, baby 
Things ain't what they used to be 
Keep on Straight Ahead 
Keep on straight Ahead

That's what they're screamin' 
Freedom of the soul 
Pass it on, pass it on to the young and old 
 
You got to tell the children the truth 
They don't need a whole lot of lies 
Because one of these days, baby 
They'll be running things 
So when you give them love 
You better give it right 
Woman and child and man and wife 
The best love to have is the Love Of Life 
 
Pushing on Straight Ahead

THE STORY OF LIFE

 The story of Jesus 
so easy to explain 
After they crucified him, 
a woman, she claimed his name 
The story of Jesus 
the whole bible knows 
went all across the desert 
and in the middle, he found a rose 
 
There should be no questions 
there should be no lies 
He was married ever happily after 
All the tears we cry 
No use in arguing 
all the use to the man that moans 
When each man falls in battle 
his soul it has to roam 
Angles of heaven 
flying saucers to some, 
made Easter Sunday 
the name of the rising sun 
 
The story is written 
by so many people who dared, 
to lay down the truth 
to so very many who cared 
to carry the cross 
of Jesus and beyond 
We will guide the light 
this time with a woman in our arms 
We as men 
can't explain the reason why 
the woman's always mentioned 
at the moment that we die 
All we know 
is God is by our side, 
and he says the word 
so easy yet so hard 
 
I wish not to be alone, 
so I must respect my other heart 
Oh, the story 
of Jesus is the story 
of you and me 
No use in feeling lonely, 
I am searching to be free 
 
The story 
of life is quicker 
than the wink of an eye 
The story of love 
is hello and goodbye 
Until we meet again 


 

JIMI HENDRIX
THE WIND CRIES MARY

 After all the jacks are in their boxes 
and the clowns have all gone to bed 
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street 
footsteps dressed in red 
And the wind whispers Mary 
A broom is drearily sweeping 
up the broken pieces of yesterdays life 
Somewhere a queen is weeping 
Somewhere a king has no wife 
And the wind, it cries Mary 
The traffic lights, they turn, uh, blue tomorrow 
and shine their emptiness down on my bed 
The tiny island sags down stream 
'cause the life that lived is, 
is dead 
And the wind screams Mary 
Uh will the wind ever remember 
the names it has blow in the past? 
And with this crutch, its old age, and its wisdom 
it whispers no, this will be the last 
And the wind cries Mary

VALLEYS OF NEPTUNE... ARISING

 (June 7, 1969) 
 
1. 
I feel the ocean swaying me ... 
washing away all my pains. 
See where I was wounded, 
Remember the scar ? 
Now you can t see a thing ... 
And I feel no pain 
 
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets 
Green and blue ... Canyons too 
Singing about Atlantis love songs. 
The Valleys of Neptune is arising. 
 
2. 
 
Mercury liquid ... Emerald s shining 
Telling me where I came from 
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he 
lays in ... on the Burning 
edge Horizon. 
 
I m sailing on the Bluebird s mission ... 
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam 
See the wind make love to all 
the ocean ... Joy spread and 
the massage got home 
 
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ... 
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord 
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ... 
The Valleys of Neptune is arising 
 
3. 
 
Look out East coast, but you re 
gonna have a neighbor, 
A rebirth land ... 
the praying Burning Sands. 
 
We know there were worlds 
so much older ... 
And they shall rise, and 
tell us much more the truth of man 
 
4. 
 
I see visions of sleeping peaks

WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW

 Well, I'm standing here, freezing, inside your golden garden 
Uh got my ladder, leaned up against your wall 
Tonight's the night we planned to run away together 
Come on Dolly Mae, there's no time to stall 
But now you're telling me... 
 
I think we better wait till tomorrow 
Hey, yeah, hey

Girl, what 'chu talkin' 'bout ? 
(I think we better wait till tomorrow) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Got to make sure it's right, so until tomorrow, goodnight. 
Oh, what a drag. 
 
Oh, Dolly Mae, how can you hang me up this way ? 
Oh, on the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today 
Now I'm standing here like some turned down serenading fool 
Hearing strange words stutter from the mixed mind of you 
And you keep tellin' me that ah... 
 
I think we better wait till tomorrow 
What are you talkin' 'bout ? 
(I think we better wait till tomorrow) 
No, can't wait that long 
(I think we better wait till tomorrow) 
Oh, no 
Got to make sure it's right, until tomorrow, goodnight, oh. 
Let's see if I can talk to this girl a little bit here... 
 
Ow ! Dolly Mae, girl, you must be insane 
So unsure of yourself leaning from your unsure window pane 
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing something from a tree ? 
Click bang, oh what a hang, your daddy just shot poor me 
And I hear you say, as I fade away... 
 
We don't have to wait till tomorrow 
Hey ! 
We don't have to wait till tomorrow 
What you say ? 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
It must have been right, so forever, goodnight, listen at 'cha. 
 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Ah ! Do I have to wait ? Don't have to wait 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
It's a drag on my part 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) Don't have to wait, uh, hmm ! Ah, no ! 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait, yeah ! 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Oh, oh 
I won't be around tomorrow, yeah ! 
(We don't have to wait till tomorrow) 
Don't have to wait

WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL

 500,000 Halos ... 
outshined the mud and history. 
We washed and drank in 
God s tears of Joy, 
And for once...and for everyone... 
the truth was not a mystery 
 
Love called to all...Music is Magic. 
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay. 
Hand in Hand as we lived and 
made real the dreams of peaceful men 
 
We came together...Danced with 
the pearls of Rainy weather 
Riding the waves of music and 
Space Music is Magic... 
Magic is life... 
Love as never Loved Before... 
Harmony to Son and Daughter...man and wife
