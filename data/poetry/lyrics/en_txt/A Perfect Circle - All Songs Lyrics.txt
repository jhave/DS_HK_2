 Threw you the obvious And you flew with it on your back A name in your recollection Down among a million, say: Difficult enough to feel a little bit Disappointed, passed over. When I've looked right through, To see you naked and oblivious and you don't see me Well I threw you the obvious, Just to see if there's more behind the Eyes of a fallen angel, Eyes of a tragedy. Here I am expecting just a little bit Too much from the wounded But I see, See through it all, See through, And see you. So I threw you the obvious Do you see what occurs behind the Eyes of a fallen angel Eyes of a tragedy Well, oh well.. Apparently nothing. Apparently nothing at all. You don't You don't You don't see me You don't You don't You don't see me You don't You don't You don't see me You don't You don't You don't see me at all 

A PERFECT CIRCLE
A STRANGER

 Cast the calming apple 
Up and over satellites 
To draw out the timid wild one 
To convince you it's alright 
And I listen for the whisper 
Of your sweet insanity while I formulate 
Denials of your affect on me 
 
You're a stranger 
So what do I care 
You vanish today 
Not the first time I hear 
All the lies 
 
What am I to do with all this silence 
Shy away, shy away phantom 
Run away terrified child 
Won't you move away you ?? 
I'm better off without 
Tearing my will down

Mistook their nods for an approval 
Just ignore the smoke and smile

 So glad to see you well 
Overcome and completely silent now 
Without himself

And not to pull your halo down 
Around your neck and tug you off your cloud

How you're planning to go about 
Making your amends to the dead 
To the dead 
 
Recall the deeds as if 
They're all someone else's 
Atrocious stories 
Now you stand reborn before us all 
So glad to see you well 
 
And not to pull your halo down 
Around your neck and tug you to the ground 
But I'm more than just curious 
How you're planning to go about 
Making your amends to the dead 
To the dead 
 
With your halo slipping down 
Your halo slipping 
Your halo slipping down 
Your halo slipping down 
Your halo slipping down [repeated]
