ABOUT YOU

 You give me power to get out of bed 
When in the morning I'm feeling dead 
Living and loving there's a lot to be said it's true 
 
Gonna say it about you 
Gonna say it about you 
 
Out of the darkness and into the light 
Straight to the centre of everything right 
Darling don't worry the sky will be bright and blue 
 
When I say it about you 
Gonna say it about you 
I'll say it about you 
 
When did you teach me to fly thru the air 
Sooner or later we all will be there 
I read the headlines and now I can swear it's true 
 
And they said it about you 
Gonna say it about you 
Gonna say it about you 
Gonna say it about you 
Gonna say it about you

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

 Ah, you don't wanna be the little woman, 
No, you don't wanna be the little woman I love, 
No, no, no, no, I love. 
 
Ah, you don't wanna stay in my school, 
You don't wanna be the one that's cool, 
You don't wanna be the little woman I love. 
 
You're up all night 
And we can let it hang down right. (yes, we could) 
I say goodbye to all my expectations 
The day you walked out of my life. 
 
Winter time is a coming now, 
Give me a sign if you can somehow. 
Make it clear where you heading for, 
Will I see you some day at my door? 
 
Taking it all in to consideration, 
Love's a game I never win. 
I've been in very similar situations 
Again and again and again. 
 
Ah, now you don't wanna be the little woman, (no!) 
You don't wanna be the little woman I love, I love. 
 
Ah, you don't wanna stay in my home, 
No, you just wanna be on your own, 
Well, you don't wanna be the little woman I love. 
 
Take it away! 
 
Oh, damn right! 
 
Ah, yeah, well, things were fine all summer long, 
And then things changed, so where did we go wrong? 
We can run but we cannot hide 
In greener grass on the other side. 
 
Taking it all in to consideration, 
But love's a game I never win. 
I've been in very similar situations 
Again and again and again, 
Again and again and again, oh, 
Again and again and again, (and again) 
Again and again and again, (and again) 
Again and again and again, (and again) 
And again and again and again, (oh)

AIN'T NO SUNSHINE

 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
It's not warm when she's away 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And she's always gone too long 
Anytime she goes away 
 
Wonder this time where she's gone 
Wonder if she's gonna stay 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away 
 
And I know, I know... 
 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Only darkness everyday 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away

ALL SHOOK UP

 (Blackwell/Presley) 
 
A well I bless my soul 
What's wrong with me? 
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree 
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug 
I'm in love 
I'm all shook up 
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah! 
 
My hands are shaky and my knees are weak 
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet 
Who do you thank when you have such luck? 
I'm in love 
I'm all shook up 
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah! 
 
Please don't ask me what's on my mind 
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine 
When I'm near that girl that I love best 
My heart beats so it scares me to death! 
 
She touched my hand what a chill I got 
Her lips are like a vulcano that's hot 
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup 
I'm in love 
I'm all shook up 
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah! 
 
My tongue get tied when I try to speak 
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree 
There's only one cure for this body of mine 
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
AND I LOVE HER

 I give her all my love 
That's all I do 
And if you saw my love 
You'd love her too 
I love her 
 
She gives me ev'rything 
And tenderly 
The kiss my lover brings 
She brings to me 
And I love her 
 
A love like ours 
Could never die 
As long as I 
Have you near me 
 
Bright are the stars that shine 
Dark is the sky 
I know this love of mine 
Will never die 
And I love her 
 
Bright are the stars that shine 
Dark is the sky 
I know this love of mine 
Will never die 
And I love her

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
ANGRY

 Whoa! 
 
What the hell gives the right 
To tell me what to do with my life? 
Especially when you made a mess 
Of every chance you had of success. 
Look at you, 
Just look at you, 
I said, I'm angry just looking at you. 
 
Well, I'm sick and tired of sitting back 
And listening to all of your clap trap. (clap trap) 
If you could get me take the rap, I guarantee 
You'd leave me with a backslap. (backslap) 
Push me to the left, push me to the right, 
Try to take me out of the way. 
Even if you knock me off the edge of the world, 
You're still gonna hear me say: 
 
What the hell gives you the right 
To tell me what to do with my life? 
Especially when you made a mess 
Of every chance you have of success. 
Look at you,

Like you're crooked, like you're lazy. (lazy)

Hit me from the top to the toe. 
Even when you chew me up and spit me out, 
I'm still gonna want to know.

ANOTHER DAY

 Every day she takes a morning bath s e wets her hair, 
Wraps a towel around her 
As she's heading for the bedroom chair, 
It's just another day. 
 
Slipping into stockings, 
Stepping into shoes, 
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat. 
Ah, it's just another day. 
 
At the office where the papers grow she takes a break, 
Drinks another coffee 
And she finds it hard to stay awake, 
 
It's just another day. Du du du du du 
It's just another day. Du du du du du

Ay 
So sad, so sad,

Alone in her apartment she'd dwell, 
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell. 
 
Ah, stay, don't stand around 
And he comes and he stays 
But he leaves the next day, 
So sad. 
Sometimes she feels so sad.

People gather 'round her 
And she finds it hard to stay alive,

ARROW THROUGH ME

 Ooh, baby, 
You couldn't have done a worse thing to me, 
If you'd had taken an arrow and runned right through me. 
Uh, uh, uh, uh. 
 
Ooh, baby, 
A bird in the hand is worth two flying, 
But when it came to love I knew you'd be lying. 
 
It could have been a finer fling, 
Would have been a major attraction. 
With no other thing 
Offering a note of distraction. 
Come on, get up, get under way and bring your love. 
 
Ooh, baby, 
You wouldn't have found a more down hero, 
If you'd had started at nothing and counted to zero. 
 
Oo oo oo. 
 
Ooh, baby, 
You couldn't have done a worse thing to me,

Featuring but love and affection.

Now the birds have all flown from our nest.

PAUL MCCARTNEY
BACK IN THE USSR

 Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC 
Didn't get to bed last night 
Oh, the way the paper bag was on my knee 
Man, I had a dreadful flight 
I'm back in the USSR 
You don't know how lucky you are, boy 
Back in the USSR, yeah 
 
Been away so long I early knew the place 
Gee, it's goo to be back home 
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case 
Honey disconnect the phone 
I'm back in the USSR 
You don't know how lucky you are, boy 
Back in the US 
Back in the US 
Back in the USSR

They leave the west behind 
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout 
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind

That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind

Come and keep your comrade warm

Back in the USSR 
Oh, let me tell you honey

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
BACK ON MY FEET

 How many days will the wet weather last? 
I want know will the clouds 
When they roll back 
Reveal a man in an old mac 
Living on a park bench 
Sitting on his own? 
 
Cut the rain as it runs down the glass 
Eventually through the lightning and thunder 
We see a man going under 
This is how it happens 
This is what he said 
 
I don't need love 
Though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 
'Til I'm back on me feet 
You're always telling me about my misery 
I've seen things you will never see 
Don't pity me 
 
Focus in on the breath of a man 
Who takes a brown paper bag 
From his knapsack 
Between his whispers and wise cracks 
He's looking for permission 
Screaming at the sky 
 
I don't need love 
Though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 
'Til I'm back on me feet 
You're always telling me about my misery 
I've seen things you will never see 
Don't pity me 
 
I'll be right again 
Be upright without you 
I'll stand up again 
Kick up a fuss again too 
 
Cut back again to a girl walking by 
Until the feet that are all shoes and no socks 
Climb an invisible soap box 
Laughing at the traffic 
Shouting at the world 
 
I don't need love 
Though temptation is sweet 
Give me your hand 
'Til I'm back on me feet 
You're always telling me about my misery 
I've seen things you will never see 
Don't pity me 
 
I'll stand up again 
Kick up a fuss again too 
I'll be right again 
Be upright without you 
 
We see a life through the eyes of a man 
As he live and he dies 
By a simple tattoo 
 
I'll be back again 
When I land on my feet 
I'll stand up again 
Kick up a fuss again, wouldn't you 
 
Well there you go, though we tried hard to know him 
It's there on his face 
He's a case where there's clearly no hope 
 
Give me your hand again 
'Til I land again 
 
His face starts to fade 
As we pull down the shade 
And the picture we made 
Is in glorious cinemascope 
 
I'll be back...

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
BACK SEAT OF MY CAR

 Speed along the highway, honey I want it my way 
But listen to her daddy's song, don't stay out to long 
Were just busy hidin', sitting the back seat of my car 
The lazy lights are pretty, we end up in Mexico City 
But listen to her daddy's song, makin' love is wrong 
Were just busy ridin', sitting the back seat of my car 
 
Oh we was only busy hidin', sitting the back seat of my car 
And when we've finshed drivin' we can say we were late in arriving 
and listen to her daddy's song, we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
 
We can make it to Mexico City, sittin' in the backseat of my car 
 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong 
NO NO NO NO 
Ohhh we believe that we can't be wrong

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
BACKWARDS TRAVELLER

 Hey, did you know that I'm 
Always going back in time 
Rhyming slang, auld lang syne my dears 
Through the years 
 
I am the backwards traveller 
Ancient wool unraveller 
Sailing songs, wailing on the moon 
 
And we were sailing songs, wailing on the moon 
Wailing on the moon.

BALLROOM DANCING

 Well, I used to smile when I was a pup, 
Sailing down the Nile in china cup, 
With the recipe for a lovely day 
Sticking out my back pocket.

Till me made it up in the ballroom.

The band is ready and we're starting with the first of our 
Dances in this competition, that's the 'cha cha cha'. 
 
Well, it went so fast and we all grew up, 
Now the days that passed in the china cup, 
Are the memories of another day 
And I wouldn't want to knock it. 
 
Oh, but it wasn't always such a pretty sight, 
'Cause, we used to fight like cats and dogs 
Till me made it up in the ballroom.

BEAUTIFUL NIGHT

 Someone's gone out fishing 
Someone's high and dry. 
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei. 
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky 
And I'm left stranded, wondering why. 
 
You and me together 
Nothing feels so good 
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood 
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles 
And I'm still stranded, wondering why 
 
Make it a beautiful night for me 
It's a beautiful night for love 
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold 
Make it a beautiful night for me 
It's a beautiful night for love 
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold 
 
Some boat's on the ocean 
We're here in this room 
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon 
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky 
No more wondering, wondering why 
 
Things can go wrong, things can go right 
Things can go bump, in the dead of the night 
So let me be there, let me be there 
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night 
 
Make it a beautiful night for me 
It's a beautiful night for love 
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold 
Make it a beautiful night for me 
Such a beautiful night for love 
Such a wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold 
 
Yeah, it's a beautiful night 
Yeah, it's a beautiful night 
 
Yeah, beautiful night, beautiful night 
Yeah, it's such a beautiful night, beautiful, beautiful night 
 
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night 
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night

BROADCAST

 We've got a chance and we'll take it; 
We may win or we may lose; 
We may even have to cut and run for it. 
Well, it won't be the first time I've run 
And it won't be the first time I've been caught. 
It's the game that matters. 
 
Brother, I am proud to know you. 
This is one of the greatest moments I have ever experienced. 
I think I'll sense a situation when we all esteemed it 
An honor to breathe the rather inferior atmosphere 
Of this station here along with our little friend. 
 
I guess we should all go home and treasure the memory of his face 
As the whitest thing in our museum of recollection. 
And, perhaps, this good woman will also go home 
And watch the face of our little brother here. 
 
I'm inspired with a new faith in mankind. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to present to you 
A sure enough saint who only wants a halo to be transfixed. 
Stand right up.

BROWN EYED HANDSOME MAN

 (Berry) 
 
Well, flying across the desert in a TWA, I saw a woman walking in the sand. 
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay to meet a brown eyed handsome man, 
her destination was a brown eyed handsome man. 
 
Way back in history three thousand years, in fact ever since the world began, 
there's been a whole lotta good women shedding tears over a brown eyed handsome man, 
a lot of trouble was a brown eyed handsome man. 
 
Well, the Milo de Venus was a beautiful lass, she had the world in the palm of her hand 
she lost both her arms in a wrestling match to win a brown eyed handsome man, 
she fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man. 
 
Well, a beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind between a doctor and a lawyer man. 
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself a brown eyed handsome man, 
just like your daddy was, a brown eyed handsome man. 
 
Well, a two, three the count with nobody home he hit a high flyer into the stand. 
A rounded third he was a heading for home, 
it was a brown eyed handsome man that won the game, It was a brown eyed handsome man. 
It was a brown eyed handsome man.

Continental breakfast in the bar 
English speaking people drinking German beer

DELIVER YOUR CHILDREN

 Well, the rain was a failin' 
And the ground turned to mud 
I was watching all the people 
Running from the flood 
So I starred to payin' 
Though I ain't no prayin' man 
For the lord to come a helpin' 
Knowing he'd understand 
 
Deliver your children to the good good life 
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife 
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night 
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right 
 
Well, I had a woman 
She was good and clean 
She spent all day with the washing machine 
But when it come to lovin' 
She was never around 
She was out getting dirty 
All over town 
 
Deliver your children to the good good life 
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife 
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night 
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right 
 
Well, I was low on money 
And my truck broke down 
I was on my way to the lost and found 
So I took it to a dealer 
I said make it run 
Well, I ain't got no money 
But I got me a gun 
 
I said you robbed me before 
So I'm robbing you back 
And if it don't put you straight 
It'll put you on the right track 
Well, I ain't no devil and I ain't no saint 
But I can tell a dealer by the colour of his paint 
 
Deliver your children to the good good life 
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife 
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night 
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right 
 
If you want good eggs 
You gotta feed that hen 
And if you wanna hear some more 
Well, I'll sing it again.

DISTRACTIONS

 What Is This Thing In Life That Persuades Me To Spend 
Time Away From You? 
If You Can Answer This You Can Have The Moon. 
This Is The Place To Be, Anyway You Can See 
There's A Lovely View. 
Why Are There Always So Many Other Things To Do? 
Distractions, Like Butterflies Are Buzzing 'Round My Head, 
When I'm Alone I Think Of You 
And The Life We'd Lead If We Could Only Be Free 
From These Distractions. 
 
The Postman's At The Door 
While The Telephone Rings On The Kitchen Wall, 
Pretend We're Not At Home And They'll Disappear. 
I Want To Be With You, Tell Me What I Can Do, 
Nothing Is Too Small 
Away From All This Jazz We Could Do Anything At All. 
Distractions, Like Butterflies Are Buzzing 'Round My Head. 
When I'm Alone I Think Of You 
And The Things We'd Do If We Could Only Be Through 
With These Distractions. 
I'll Fond The Peaceful Place Far A Way From The Noise Of A Busy 
Day 
Where We Can Spend Our Nights Counting Shooting Stars, 
Distractions, Like Butterflies Are Buzzing 'Round My Head. 
When I'm Alone I Think Of You 
And The Things We'd Do If We Could Only Be Through 
With These Distractions, Like Butterflies They're 
Buzzing 'Round My Head, When I'm Alone I Think Of You 
And The Life We'd Lead If We Could Only Be Free 
From These Distractions.

DON'T BE CARELESS LOVE

 Burn The Midnight Lamp 
Down Until The Dawn, 
I'll Keep Watch Until I'm Sure Your Coming Home. 
Shadows Play And Flicker On The Bedroom Wall 
They Turn Into A Bad Dream Overnight, 
Something Could Be Terribly Wrong. 
Don't Be Careless Love, 
Don't Be Careless Love, 
Don't Be, Don't Be Careless. 
In My Dream You're Running Nowhere 
Every Step You've Taken Turns To Glue, 
Walking Down A Spiral Staircase 
Failing Through, Failing Through, 
Don't Be Careless Love, 
Be Careless Love. 
The Lamp Burns Down And Out 
I'm Getting Pretty Tired Of This, 
I Feel So Bad Something Might Be Going Amiss, 
I Won't Be There So Look Out For Yourself 
You're Getting In Deep Whatever You Do, 
Don't Let Me Go Back To Sleep, 
Don't Be Careless Love, 
Don't Be Careless Love, 
Don't Be, Don't Be Careless. 
Saw Your Face In The Morning Paper, 
Saw Your Body Rolled Up In A Rug 
Chopped Up Into Two Little Pieces 
By Some Thug, 
Don't Be Careless Love, 
Be Careless Love. 
But In The Morning Light 
When I Wake Up Again 
You're By My Side And That's The Way It's Always Been, 
But In The Dark Your Mind Plays Funny Tricks On You, 
Your Mind Plays Funny Tricks On You, 
Your Mind Plays Funny Tricks On You, 
Don't Be Careless Love.

DON'T GET AROUND MUCH ANYMORE

 Missed the Saturday dance 
Heard they crowded the floor 
Couldn't bear it without you 
Don't Get Around Much Anymore. 
 
Thought I'd visit the club 
Got as far as the door 
They'd have asked me about you 
Don't Get Around Much Anymore. 
 
Oh, darling I guess 
My mind's more at ease 
But nevertheless 
Why bring my memo, why bring my memo, 
Why bring my memories. 
 
Been invited on dates 
Might have gone but what for 
It's awfully different without you 
Don't Get Around Much Anymore. 
 
Thought I'd visit the club 
Got as far as the door

DON'T LET IT BRING YOU DOWN

 Though some things in life are hard to bear 
Don't let it bring you down 
 
Should the sand of time run out on you 
Don't let it bring you down 
 
Don't go down don't go underground 
Things seem strange, but they change 
How they change 
 
Up and down your carousel will go 
Don't let it bring you down 
 
Don't go down don't get out of town 
Get to know how it goes, how it goes 
 
When the price you have to pay is high 
Don't let it bring you down.

DRESS ME UP AS A ROBBER

 You can dress me up as a robber, 
But I won't be in disguise. 
Only love is a robber 
And he lives within your eyes. 
Oo oo oo oo ee oo. 
 
You can dress me up as a sailor, 
But I'll never run to sea, 
As long as your love is available to me 
What do I do with a sea of blue? 
Oo ee oo. 
 
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. 
 
Dressing me up, 
It doesn't make a diff'rence what you want to do. 
Which ever way you look at it, 
I'm still in love with you. 
If we go on forever, I may never make a change. 
 
Dressing me up, (dressing me up) 
And if I don't convince you, you needn't look too far 
To see that I'm not lying 
But I love you the way you are. 
What's the point of changing when I'm happy as I am? 
 
You can dress me up as a soldier, 
But I wouldn't know what for, 
I was the one that told you he loved you, 
Don't wanna go to another war. 
No, no, no. 
 
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

Lives in a dream 
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door 
Who is it for? 
 
All the lonely people 
Where do they all come from ? 
All the lonely people 
Where do they all belong ?

No one comes near. 
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there 
What does he care?

FAMOUS GROUPIES

 All stand back, let the people see 
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me 
 
Behold the famous groupies 
They are alike as two peas 
And where the other goes, the other goes 
But though the famous groupies 
Are only paid in rupies 
Nobody knows what the famous groupies know 
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go 
 
There was a bango player 
Who kept an extra layer 
Of dunlopillo mattress in his van 
But when the famous groupies 
Arrived with their twin snoopies 
Nobody saw which way the poor boy ran 
Nobody does it like a famous groupie can 
 
All stand back, let the people see 
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me 
 
There was a lead guitarist 
Who lived in Epping forest 
And all he ever wanted was to blow 
When the girls were with him 
He never lost his rhythm 
And nobody knows what the famous groupies know 
Nobody goes where the famous groupies go 
 
There was a classic story 
Of a roadic nicknamed Rory 
Who used to practice voodoo on the side 
When the famous twosome 
Suggested something gruesome 
All that they found was a crater two miles wide 
Which left the music business absolutely horrified 
 
Ladies and gentlemen, those magnificent examples of 
Female pulchritude and luminosity, direct from their 
Global perambulations to the very boards of this 
Supremely magnificent proscenium arch ladies and 
Gentlemen; I give you famous groupies!

Shooting stars from a purple sky

Stick my tongue out and lick my nose 
Tuck my shirt in and zip my fly 
Go ahead, have a vision 
I'm the man on the flaming pie 
 
Everything I do has a simple explanation 
When I'm with you, you could do with a vacation 
I took my brains out and stretched 'em on a rack 
Now I'm not so sure I'm ever gonna get 'em back 
 
Cut my toes off to spite my feet 
I don't know whether to laugh or cry 
Never mind, check my rhythm

FOOTPRINTS

 It's beautiful outside, 
An old hand gathers wood, 
Can he see me sitting here? 
His mind is somewhere else. 
 
His friends have flown away, 
He's left out in the cold. 
He won't sit by my fire, 
He says he likes it in the snow. 
Where footprints never go, 
He likes it in the snow. 
 
It's getting dark outside, 
The old man's going home. 
Has he someone waiting there? 
Is he living on his own? 
Where footprints never go, 
He likes it in the snow. 
 
In white blanket, 
Hiding the traces of tears she didn't see. 
Oh, white blanket, 
Covers the memory of all that used to be, 
All that used to be. 
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way, 
He can't help feeling that she might come back some day. 
 
It's beautiful outside, 
A magpie looks for food. 
The old hand throws a crumb, 
Do you think he's found a friend? 
Where footprints never go, 
He likes it in the snow. 
 
Oh, white blanket, 
Hiding the traces of paths he didn't take. 
Oh, oh, white blanket, 
Covers the memory of moves he didn't make. 
 
Go now, 
 
Oh, white blanket, 
Hiding the traces of tears she didn't see. 
Snow white blanket, 
Simply covers the memory of all that used to be. 
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way, 
He can't help feeling that she might come back some day.

FOR NO ONE

 Your day breaks, 
Your mind aches, 
You find that all her words of kindness linger on 
When she no longer needs you. 
 
She wakes up, 
She makes up, 
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry; 
She no longer needs you. 
 
And in her eyes you see nothing, 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one. 
A love that should have lasted years. 
 
You want her, 
You need her, 
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead; 
You think she needs you. 
 
And in her eyes you see nothing, 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one. 
A love that should have lasted years. 
 
You stay home, 
She goes out, 
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone; 
She doesn't need him. 
 
Your day breaks, 
Your mind aches, 
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head, 
You won't forget her. 
 
And in her eyes you see nothing, 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one. 
A love that should have lasted years. 
 
Mm mm.

 And when the time comes around 
We will be duty bound 
To tell the through of what we've seen 
And what we haven't found 
Will not be going down 
Despite too easy ride to see 
 
From a lover to a friend 
Take your own advice 
Let me love again 
Now that you turned out to be 
Someone I can trust 
Someone I believe 
 
Ohh la la la 
How can I walk when I can't find a way 
I have a dilemma 
All I want is to tell me 
You're going to take it away 
 
From a lover to a friend 
Take your own advice 
Let me love again 
Now that you turned out to be 
Someone I can trust 
Someone I believe 
 
And what we haven't found

GET IT

 You've gotta get it, mm mm, 
You've gotta get it, 
Don't forget it doesn't come around again. 
You've gotta get it, mm mm, 
You've gotta get it and you've gotta get it good. 
 
Once I had a little Spanish guitar, 
The neighbours told me I could go pretty far. 
Well, I came and I went 
And my guitar got bent. 
 
But I discovered that the people who love 
Are what we need if we're to get up above it all, 
And that's that, 
Unless the world is flat. 
 
I wanna get it, mm mm, 
I wanna get it just in case it doesn't come around again. 
I wanna get it, mm mm, 
I wanna get it and I wanna get it good 
 
Doo doo, doo doo, 
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, 
Doo doo, doo doo, 
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, 
 
Pardon me if I've been misunderstood, 
I wanna get it while the going is good. 
The telephone rang 
About a song I sang. 
 
The life of cadillac and ultra for sure, 
Is automatic for the lady demure, 
She came and she went 
Without a single dent. 
 
You've gotta get it, mm mm, 
You've gotta get it, 
Don't forget it doesn't come around again.

 Say you don't love him, my salamander, 
Why did you need him? 
Oh no, don't answer, oh no. 
I'm getting closer,

Keeping ahead of the rain on the road, 
Watching my windscreen wipers (wipers)

Hitting the chisel and making a joint, 
Gluing my fingers together (together) 
Radio play me a song with a point, 
Sailor beware of weather (weather) 
 
Oh, oh, 
Oh, oh. 
 
I'm getting closer, my salamander,

In the heart of the country. 
 
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go, 
I'm gonna tell everyone I know 
Livin' in a home 
In the heart of the country. 
 
Heart of the country 
Where the holy people grow, 
Heart of the country, 
Smell the grass in the meadow. 
 
Wo wo wo..

HEATHER

 I'm gonna fly to the moon 
Check in outta space 
Find me a suitable plot 
Build myself a place 
There I will stay 
For a year and a day 
Until the cares of my life blow away 
And I will dance to a runcible tune 
With the queen of my heart

HEAVEN ON A SUNDAY

 Peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday 
Wishful, not thinking what to do 
We've been calling it love 
But it's a dream we're going through 
 
And if I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
 
Restful, like Devon on a Monday 
Cooling my fingers in the bay 
We've been learning a song 
But it's a long and lonely blues 
 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
 
It's peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday 
Wishful, not thinking what to do 
We've been calling it love 
But it's a dream we're going through 
 
And if I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love 
Yours would be the one I'd choose 
If I only had one love

HELEN WHEELS

 Said farewell to my last hotel, it was never much kind of abode 
Glasgow town never brought me down when I was heading out on the road 
Carlisle city never looked so pretty and the kendal freeway's fast 
Slowdown driver, want to stay alive, I want to make this journey last. 
 
Helen, hell on wheels, ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels 
Helen, hell on wheels, and they never gonna take her away 
 
M6 south down to Liverpool, where they play the west coast sound, 
Sailor sam he came from Birmingham but he never will be found 
Doing fine when a London sign greets me like a long lost friend, 
Mister motor won't you check her out, she's got to take me back again. 
 
Helen, hell on wheels, ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels 
Helen, hell on wheels, and they never gonna take her away

HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE

 To lead a better life I need my home to be here... 
 
Here, making each day of the year 
Changing my life with the wave of her hand 
Nobody can deny that there's something there 
 
There, running my hands through her hair 
Both of us thinking how good it can be 
Someone is speking but she doesn't know he's there 
 
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me 
I know I need never care 
But to love her is to need her everywhere 
Knowing that love is to share 
 
Each one believing that love never dies 
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there 
 
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me 
I know I need never care 
But to love her is to need her everywhere 
Knowing that love is to share 
 
Each one believing that love never dies 
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there 
 
To be there and everywhere 
Here, there and everywhere

HERE TODAY

 And if I say I really knew you well, 
What would your answer be? 
If you were here today. 
Uh, uh, uh, here today. 
 
Well, knowing you, 
You'd probably laugh and say 
That we were worlds apart. 
If you were here today. 
Uh, uh, uh, here today. 
 
But as for me, 
I still remember how it was before 
And I am holding back the tears no more. 
Uh, uh, uh, 
I love you, uh. 
 
What about the time we met? (what about the time?) 
Well, I suppose that you could say 
That we were playing hard to get. 
Didn't understand a thing, 
But we could always sing. 
 
What about the night we cried? (what about the night) 
Because there wasn't any reason 
Left to keep it all inside. 
Never understood a word, 
But you were always there with a smile. 
 
And if I say I really loved you 
And was glad you came along. 
Then you were here today, 
Uh, uh, uh, for you were in my song. 
 
Uh, uh, uh, here today.

Deny that there's something there. 
 
I want her ev'rywhere 
And if she's beside me I know I need never care. 
But to love her is to meet her 
 
Ev'rywhere, 
Knowing that love is to share, 
Each one believing that love never dies, 
Watching her eyes 
And hoping I'm always there. 
 
I will be here, there and ev'rywhere.

This is not a lie. 
 
No, it isn't, 
Oh, oh, oh, 
Mm mm mm. 
 
It's funny thing, 
Half serious, 
With our hands on our ears. 
Living dreams with mouths ajar, 
Wide awake we go to sleep. 
 
However absurd, 
However absurd it may seem. 
However absurd, 
However absurd it may seem. 
 
Something special between us, 
When we made love the game was over. 
I couldn't say the words, 
Words wouldn't get my feelings through, 
And so I keep talking to you. 
 
However absurd, 
However absurd it may seem. 
However absurd, 
However absurd it may seem.

I LOST MY LITTLE GIRL

 Well I Woke Up Late This Morning 
My Head Was In The Whirl 
Only When I Realized 
I Lost My Little Girl 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
 
Well Her Clothes Were Not Expensive 
Her Hair 
Didn't Always Curl 
I Don't Know Why I Loved Her 
But I Loved My Little Girl 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
 
**Well Gather Round People 
Let Me Tell You The Story 
The Very First Song I Wrote 
Repeat** 
 
Repeat*

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU

 Last Night You Helped Me Through, 
Took Me To The Lovers Zone. 
I Saw There, Images 
Projected On A Wall Of Stone. 
I Stood Inside Egyptian Temples, 
I Looked Into Eternal Gardens, 
Lay On The Shores Of Distant Islands, 
Linstening To The Sea Birds Song Of Joy. 
 
Oh I Owe It All To You, 
You Make Me Happy, 
Oh I Owe It All To You. 
 
Late Last Night We Were Right 
Into Some Exotic Scene. 
Everywhere, Images 
Appearing On A Giant Screen. 
I Stood Inside A Glass Cathedral, 
I Looked Into The Golden Canyon, 
Lay By The Lakes Of Holy Water 
Glistening Like A Diamond In The Light. 
 
Oh I Owe It All To You, 
You Make Me Happy, 
Oh I Owe It All To You.

I SAW HER STANDING THERE

 Well she was just seventeen 
You know what I mean 
And the way she looked 
Was way beyond compare 
So how could I dance with another, 
Oh, when I saw her standing there 
 
Well she looked at me 
and I, I could see 
That before too long 
I'd fall in love with her 
She wouldn't dance with another 
Oh, when I saw her standing there 
 
Well my heart went boom 
When I crossed that room 
And I held her hand in mine 
 
Oh we danced through the night 
And we held each other tight 
And before too long 
I fell in love with her 
Now I'll never dance with another 
Oh, when I saw her standing there 
 
Well my heart went boom 
When I crossed that room 
And I held her hand in mine

KEEP UNDER COVER

 Love, I'm gonna pick you up in the morning, 
Love, I'm gonna take you out on a journey. 
I don't know where I'm going to, 
But I know what I've been going through, 
Without you by my side. 
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo. 
 
What good is butter if you haven't got bread? 
What good is art when it hurts your head? 
Might as well be in bed. 
 
Keep under cover 'til the battle has ceased, 
Keep out of trouble 'til the prisoners are released. 
 
What good's a puzzle when you haven't a clue? 
What good is me when I'm not with you? 
Might as well stay in bed. 
 
Keep under cover 'til the clouds disappear, 
Keep out of trouble 'til the weather is bright and clear. 
 
Love, I'm gonna pick you up, 
I'm gonna take you out. 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 
But I know what I've been going through, 
Without you by my side, 
Without you by my side, 
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo. 
 
What good is tennis when there isn't a ball? 
What good's a curtain without a call? 
Might as well be in bed. 
 
Keep under cover 'til the battle has ceased, 
Keep out of trouble 'til the prisoners are released. 
 
Love, I'm gonna pick you up, (i'm gonna pick you up) 
I'm gonna take you out. (yes, I'll be taking you out) 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 
But I know what I've been going through,

LADY MADONNA

 Oh! 
 
Lady Madonna, children at your feet, 
Wonders how you manage to make ends meet. 
Who finds the money when you pay the rent, 
Did you know that money was heaven sent? 
 
Friday night arrives without a suitcase, 
Sunday morning creeping like a nun. 
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace, 
(see how they'll run!) 
 
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast, 
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest, ooh. 
 
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, 
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, 
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, 
See how they'll run! 
 
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed, 
Listen to the music playing in your head, ooh oh oh.. 
 
Tuesday afternoon is never ending, 
Wedn'sday morning papers didn't come, 
Thursday night your stockings needed mending, 
See how they'll run! 
 
Lady Madonna, children at your feet, 
Wonders how you manage to make ends meet.

You used to say life and let life 
(you know you did, you know you did you know you did) 
But in this ever changing world in which we live in 
Makes you give in and cry 
 
Say live and let die 
Live and let die 
Live and let die 
Live and let die 
 
What does it matter to ya 
When you got a job to do 
You gotta do it well 
You gotta give the other fellow hell 
 
When you were young and your heart was an open book 
You used to say life and let life 
(you know you did, you know you did you know you did) 
But in this ever changing world in which we live in 
Makes you give in and cry.

LONDON TOWN

 Walking down the sidewalk one purple afternoon, 
I was accosted by a barker 
Playing a simple tune upon his flute. 
Toot toot toot toot. 
Silver rain was falling down 
Upon the dirty ground of London town. 
 
People pass me by on my imaginary street, 
Ordinary people it's impossible to meet, 
Holding conversations that are always incomplete. 
Well I don't know. 
 
Oh, where are there places to go? 
Someone, somewhere has to know. 
I'don't know. 
 
Out of work again, the actor entertains his wife 
With the same old stories of his ordinary life. 
Maybe he exaggerates the trouble and the strife. 
Well, I don't know. 
 
Oh, where are there places to go? 
Someone, somewhere has to know. 
 
Crawling down the pavement on a Sunday afternoon, 
I was arrested by a rozzer 
Wearing a pink balloon about his foot. 
Toot toot toot toot. 
Silver rain was falling down 
Upon the dirty ground of London town. 
 
Someone, somewhere has to know. 
Silver rain was falling down 
Upon the dirty ground of London town.

LONELY ROAD

 I tried to get over you 
I tried to find something new 
But all I could ever do 
Was fill my time 
With thoughts of you 
 
I tried to go somewhere old 
To search for my pot of gold 
But all I could ever hold 
Inside my mind 
Were thoughts of you 
 
I hear your music 
And it's driving me wild 
Familiar rhythms 
In a different style 
I hear your music 
And it's driving me wild again 
 
Don't want to let you take me down 
Don't want to get hurt second time around 
Don't want to walk that lonely road again 
 
I hear your music 
And it's driving me wild 
Familiar rhythms 
In a different style 
I hear your music 
And it's driving me wild again 
 
Don't want to let you take me down 
Don't want to get hurt second time around 
Don't want to walk that lonely road again 
 
Don't want to let you take me down 
Don't want to get hurt second time around 
Don't want to walk that lonely road again 
 
Ad lib to end

LONESOME TOWN

 (Knight) 
 
There's a place where lovers go 
To cry their troubles away 
And we call it Lonesome Town 
Where the broken hearts stay 
 
You can buy a dream or two 
To last you all through the years 
And the only price you pay 
Is heart full of tears 
 
Going down to Lonesome Town, where the broken hearts stay 
I'm going down to Lonesome Town, to cry my troubles away 
 
And in the town of broken dreams 
The streets are filled with regret 
Maybe down in Lonesome Town 
Well I can learn to forget 
 
Lead solo 
 
Going down to Lonesome Town, where the lonely hearts stay 
I'm going down to Lonesome Town, to cry, to cry my troubles away 
 
And in the town of broken dreams 
The streets are filled with regret 
Maybe down in Lonesome Town 
I can learn to forget 
 
Maybe down in Lonesome Town 
I can learn to forget

LONG HAIRED LADY

 Well, well, well, well, well, 
Do you love me like you know you ought to do? 
Well, well, well, well, well, 
Or is this the only thing you want me for? 
Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about it for sometime, 
Sweet little lass, you are my long haired lady. 
 
Who's the lady that makes that brief occasional laughter? 
She's the lady we wears those flashing eyes. 
Who'll be taking her home when all the dancing is over? 
I'm the lucky man she will hypnotize. 
 
Long haired lady. Long haired lady. 
 
Bells are buzzing about my sweet delectable baby, 
Birds are humming about their big surprise. 
Who's your favorite person, dear phenomenal lady? 
I belong to the girl with flashing eye. 
 
Long haired lady. Long haired lady. 
 
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long. 
Ah, when you're wrong, love is long, love is long.

And Stick It In His Own Brain 
You Know What I Mean 
 
I Saw A Rabbit With Its Eyes Full Of Tears 
The Lab That Owned Her Had 
Been Doing It For Years 
Why Don't We Make Them Pay For Every Last Eye 
That Couldn't Cry Its Own Tears 
Do You Know What I Mean 
 
When I Tell You That We'll All Be 
Looking For Changes 
Changes In The Way We Treat Our Fellow Creatures 
And We Will Learn How To Grow

A Guy Beside Him Gave Him Cigarettes To Smoke

MAGIC

 There must have been magic 
The night that we met 
If I hadn't stopped you 
I'd always regret 
 
A few minutes later 
You'd have been out that door 
And I'd have been lonely 
Forever more 
Forever more 
 
Oh what made us do it? 
Under what holy spell? 
Nature's mother knew it 
Only too well 
 
She reached out her fingers 
To point at the sky 
Leaving me helpless 
Not knowing why 
 
And this is the hour 
That they turn out the light 
Nothing but memories 
Burning so bright 
Burning so bright 
 
Oh what made us do it? 
Under what holy spell? 
Nature's mother knew it 
Only too well 
 
There must have been magic 
The night that we met 
If I hadn't stopped you 
I'd always regret 
 
There must have been magic 
There must have been magic 
There must have been magic 
The night that we met

MAGNETO AND TITANIUM MAN

 Well I was talking last night 
Magneto and titanium man ... 
We were talking about you, babe, 
Oo they said 
 
You were involved in a robbery 
That was due to happen 
At a quarter to three 
In the main street. 
 
I didn't believe them 
Magneto and titanium man ... 
But when the crimson dynamo 
Finally assured me, well, I knew 
 
You were involved in a robbery 
That was due to happen 
At a quarter to three 
In the main street. 
 
So we went out 
Magneto and titanium man ... 
And the crimson dynamo 
Came along for the ride 
 
We went to town with the library 
And we swung all over that 
Long tall bank in the main street 
 
Well there she were and to my despair 
She's a five star criminal 
Breaking the code 
 
Magneto said now the time come 
To gather our forces and run!!! 
Oh no ... 
This can't be so ... 
 
And then it occurred to me! 
 
You couldn't be bad 
Magneto was mad! 
Titanium too! 
And the crimson dynamo 
Just couldn't cut it no more 
You were the law ...

Oh oh oh

The rain comes falling from the sky, 
To fill the stream that fills the sea 
And that's where life began for you and me 
 
So the next time you see rain it ain't bad, 
Don't complain it rains for you, 
The next time you see l.a. Rainclouds, 
Don't complain it rains for you and me 
 
Mamunia mamunia mamunia 
Oh oh oh 
Mamunia mamunia oh oh oh oh 
 
It might have been a bright blue day 
But rainclouds had to come this way 
They're watering everything that they can see. 
 
A seed is waiting in the earth 
For rain to come and give him free, 
So the next time you see l.a. Rainclouds 
Don't complain, it rains for you. 
 
So lay down your umbrellas 
Strip off your plastic macs. 
You've never felt the rain my friend, 
Till you've felt it running down your back 
 
So the next time you see rain, it ain't bad 
Don't complain, it rains for you. 
The next time you see l.a. Rainclouds 
Don't complain it rains for you and me.

MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB

 Mary had a little lamb, 
His fleece was white as snow, 
Ev'rywhere that mary went, 
That lamb was sur to go. 
 
And you could hear them singing: 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
 
He followed her to school one day, 
It was against the rules, 
Made the children laugh and play to 
See a lamb at school. 
 
You could hear them singing: 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
 
Soon the teacher turned it out, 
Still it lingered near, 
Waited patiently about till 
Mary did appear. 
 
You could hear them singing: 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
 
 But the lamb loved Mary so , 
The eager children cry, 
 And mary loves the lamb, you know , 
The teacher did reply. 
 
And you could hear them singing: 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

MEDICINE JAR

 What's wrong with you? 
I wish I knew 
You say time and tell 
I hope that's true 
There's more to life than blues and reds 
I say, I know how you feel, 
Now your friends are dead. 
 
Dead on your feet, you won't get far 
If you keep on sticking your hand 
In the medicine jar. 
 
Now don't give up 
Whatever you do 
You say time will tell 
I hope that's true 
If you go down and lose your head 
I say, I know how you feel

 Well you wake up in the morning. 
Hear the ding dong ring, 
You go a marching to the table, 
See the same damn thing; 
Well, it's on a one table, 
Knife, a fork and a pan, 
And if you say anything about it, 
You're in trouble with the man. 
 
cho: Let the midnight special 
Shine her light on me; 
Let the midnight special 
Shine her ever loving light on me. 
 
If you ever go to Houston. 
You better walk right; 
You better not stagger, 
You better not fight; 
Sheriff Benson will arrest you, 
He'll carry you down, 
And if the jury finds you guilty, 
Penitentiary bound. 
 
Yonder come little Rosie, 
How in the world do you know, 
l can tell her by her apron, 
And the dress she wore. 
Umbrella on her shoulder, 
Piece of paper in her hand, 
She goes a marching to the captain, 
Says, I want my man. 
 
 I don' believe that Rosie loves me 
 Well tell me why 
She ain't been to see me 
Since las' July. 
She brought me little coffee 
She brought me little tea 
Brought me damn near ever'thing 
But the jailhouse key. 
 
Yonder comes Doctor Adams 
 How in the world do you know? 
Well he gave me a tablet 
The day befo' 
There ain't no doctor 
In all the lan' 
Can cure the fever 
Of a convict man.

In Her Bed, 
She Wants To Shout At The Back Of His Head 
Look At Me, Look At Me, Look At Me I'm Afraid 
See What It's Come To, 
I'm Just Your Mistress And Maid. 
 
The Wine Is Warm 
But The Dinner Is Cold. 
The Look In His Eye Tells Her It Won't Be Long 
'Till The Girls On The Page Come To Life. 
And They'll Get The Flowers That He Used To Bring 
With Every Endearing Remark, 
And All Of The Passionate Promises 
He'll Never Fulfil In The Dark.

Look At Me, Look At Me, Now That I'm Not Afraid.

MONKBERRY MOON DELIGHT

 So I sat in the attic, 
A piano at my nose, 
And the wind played a dreadful cantata (cantata...). 
 
Sore was I from the crack of an enemy's hose, 
And the horrible sound of tomato (tomato...). 
 
Ketchup (ketchup) 
Soup and puree (soup and puree), 
Don't get left behind (get left behind)... 
 
When a rattle of rats had awoken, 
The sinews, the nerves and the veins. 
My piano was boldly outspoken, in attempts to repeat its refrain. 
 
So I stood with a knot in my stomach, 
And I gazed at that terrible sight 
Of two youngsters concealed in a barrel, 
Sucking monkberry moon delight. 
 
Monkberry moon delight, 
Monkberry moon delight. 
 
Well, I know my banana is older than the rest, 
And my hair is a tangled beretta. 
When I leave my pajamas to billy budapest, 
And I don't get the gist of your letter (your letter...). 
 
Catch up! (catch up), 
Cats and kittens (cats and kittens), 
Don't get left behind (get left behind)... 
 
Monkberry moon delight... 
Monkberry moon delight...

MORSE MOOSE AND THE GREY GOOSE

 Right on down at the bottom of the sea 
Tell me are you receiving me? 
My name is Morse moose and I'm calling you 
 
The grey goose was a steady boat 
People said she's never float 
One night when the moon was high 
The grey goose flew away 
 
As we were sailing 'round the rocks 
The mate took out his compass box 
And said the wind is like a fox 
But the grey goose flew away 
 
When out upon the open sea 
The admiral, the mate and me 
Prepared to face eternity 
But the grey goose flew away 
 
She flew into the stormy sea 
Davy Jones was calling me 
But heading for tranquillity 
The grey goose flew away.

MOVE OVER BUSKER

 Well, the rest of my life lay in front of me, 
I was pedalling down the road, 
When I saw nell gwynne and her oranges, 
And I say, i'll have one of those! 
She said, 
 move over, busker, don't bang the drum, 
Move over, busker, your time will come. 
 
Well, I was hanging around for a miracle, 
Struggling with a rhyme, 
When I saw mae west in a sweaty vest, 
And I said i'll come up and see you some time . 
She said, 
 move over, busker, that's not my style, 
Your chance is coming in a little while. 
 
You've got it coming, come on, come on, 
You've got it coming, coming to you. 
You've got it coming, come on, come on, 
You've got it coming, coming to you. 
 
Well, I've been waiting, (waiting) 
But I'm impatient, 
No one can hold me back, 
I wanna stay with the action. 
But I won't get it, (get it) 
My great illusion will vanish anyhow 
If I don't grab it now. 
 
Whoa! 
Oo wee, babe! 
A belly dancer! 
 
Well, I was hacking my way through the undergrowth, 
Juggling with my pride, 
When I saw errol flynn in a tiger skin, 
And I said, you look satisfied! 
Uh, well, he looked down at me from his motor home, 
And he gave me a dirty smile. 
He said, 
 well, yes, I am, but she's calling me, 
Would you excuse us for a while? 
 
Yeah, move over, busker, your day is done, 
Move over, busker, my time has come. 
 
I'm telling you to 
Move over, busker, (come on, come on) 
I'll bang my drum. (come on, come on) 
Move over, busker, my time has come. 
(you've got it coming, coming to you) 
 
Ooh, move over, busker, (come on, come on) 
Yeah, your day, your day is done. (come on, come)

CHORUS 
(Ah), Ah 
 
SHANTY 
The air raid siren slices through 
A night in 1942. 
A couple sheltering in the gloom 
Know all too well this waiting room 
For often they have in the past 
Been huddled close against the blast 
Of doodle bugs and bombs galore, 
They can't put up with any more. 
So it was that I was born 
Into this world one summer morning 
And breaking through this brand new day 
I hear the sound of warning. 
 
CHORUS 
(War, Ah) 
 
SHANTY 
Oh will it all end here? 
Or is their future round the corner? 
You'll be forgiven if you're down on your knees. 
What will it be what will it? 
What will we be what will we? 
What will we see what will we see? 
 
They stay in darkness underground 
Until they hear the All Clear sound 
And weary eyes will search the sky 
For any sign of sunlight. 
For any sign of sunlight. 
 
CHORUS 
Mother and father holding their child, 
Not knowing what future magic lies inside. 
We open our hearts, 
You open the door 
To peace and happiness for evermore, 
For us for evermore.

 BOYS 
We're here in school today to get a perfect education, 
Yes, we're going up. 
We're keen to learn the rules and laws that civilization taught us 
Yes, we're growing up. 
Not for ourselves, B 
but for the whole world were we born. 
And we were born in Liverpool. 
 
Our teachers say that ignorance will always drag us down, 
It's like a nagging cough. 
 
SHANTY (thrown away) 
But I can say that looking back, 
The most important thing I found was sagging off! 
Not for the whole world. 
But for yourself were you born. 
And you were... 
 
SHANTY and BOYS 
Born in Liverpool. 
 
BOYS 
Not Birmingham 
Nor Edinburgh. 
Not Manchester

Being born where you were born 
Carries with it certain responsibilities.

This school is only good for those 
Who want to learn from books. 
 
You'll lose your sense of purpose...

We're scared of teacher's looks. 
Not for ourselves,

Down the stairs and into the playground.

Through the school gates, 
Cross the road, and over the cemetery fence, 
Down the hill to where the grave stones 
Lie inviting in the sun. 
 
Settle down. 
Settle down. 
Let the afternoon slip by. 
Settle down. 
Settle down. 
It's the perfect place for a kip. 
 
(Shanty falls asleep on a grave stone and dreams) 
 
SHANTY 
 
Kept in confusion, 
Trapped by illusion, 
Thinking of speaking my mind. 
Dreams of the future, 
Ghosts of the past left behind. 
 
Constantly drifting, 
Endlessly lifting 
More weight than one man can bear. 
Into the future, 
Ghosts of the past everywhere.

Why does it have to be so?

 SHANTY 
And so it was that I had grown 
Into a youth uncertain, thrown 
Amongst the lions and the lambs. 
To pass the time we watched the children dance. 
 
I used to come here when this place was a crypt. 
Now the music plays. 
Oh don't you sometimes wish they'd stick to the script 
As the local preacher says. 
 
Rain from heaven will blessings bring, 
Behold the harvest grown. R 
Ian from heaven falls down on you, 
But me, I feel alone. 
 
PREACHER (sympathetically) 
Alone.

If they won't come to worship 
God in a church 
Something must be done.

For a way to make it fun. 
Rain from heaven will blessings bring, 
Behold the harvest grown. 
 
SHANTY and PREACHER 
Rain from heaven falls down on you,

Thought I had a vision 
Lying in a graveyard, 
Thought I heard a melody inside. 
Could it be the future, 
Speaking with the voice of those who died? 
 
Thought I saw a kingdom, 
Happiness and laughter, 
Somewhere for an innocent to play. 
Is there any justice? 
Do these things still happen in this way? 
 
MARY DEE 
Don't tell him no, 
It isn't fair. 
For he was told by those who know 
There was love everywhere. 
 
SHANTY 
Love everywhere.

Now's the time to tell him, 
While his mother's crying. 
Break it to him gently as she weeps. 
Let him know his father 
Will be well looked after, where he sleeps. 
 
CHORUS (ghosts) 
He's sleeping amongst us. 
He's in our dreams. 
Don't worry. he's with us now.

In my life. 
 
You should have warned me Of all the dangers. 
But maybe there were some things you just didn't know. 
But you're my father, 
And surely fathers ought to know about most things 
In this life. 
Don't tell me. 
I thought you were the best. 
You were only human 
And a lot like all the rest.

Not secure

That would speed past your door.

Something in the air 
Is slowly drawing us together.

Sit tight, 
Be brave. 
And believe in something more.

Drawing us inevitably towards it.

Did I sign the letter that you typed up yesterday? 
Is Mr. Fisher on the flight to LA? 
He's got the details of the takeover bid 
And I'll be in a meeting with the Minister. 
 
WOMEN'S CHORUS 
Minister, Minister of love. 
 
Love. 
 
MARY DEE 
Feeling confusion, 
Fear of intrusion, 
Frightened of losing my mind. 
Dreams of the future, 
Thoughts of myself left behind. 
 
WOMEN'S CHORUS 
Working women at the top. 
 
MARY DEE 
Will I ever stop? 
Orders piling up and up. 
 
WOMEN'S CHORUS 
Days go by like Thursday, Friday. 
 
MARY DEE 
Always on the go. 
Part of myself lives inside. 
 
(Shanty's office) 
 
MEN'S CHORUS 
When you ask a working man, 
'Does he ever stop?' 
Will he make it to the top? 
Should he take a break on Sunday? 
Work until he drop. 
 
SHANTY 
My early days in school required 
A lot of concentration 
I was finding out. 
 
But now in later years I find 
My colleagues here are more inclined 
To mess about. 
My wife at home 
Would surely never understand 
If I so much as look at someone else 
 
MEN'S CHORUS 
If men had been the faithful sort 
It surely would have changed the course of history. 
 
Don't ask me who the first man was 
That dared to take a mistress, 
It's a mystery. 
Your wife at home 
Would surely have to understand 
If you were ever seen with someone else. 
 
MR. DINGLE 
Oh, no she won't! 
 
MEN'S CHORUS 
You wouldn't dare! 
 
SHANTY 
Oh, yes I would! 
 
MR, DINGLE 
Oh, no you don't! 
 
MEN'S CHORUS 
All things matrimonial 
Carry with them certain responsibilities. 
 
SHANTY and MR. DINGLE 
(Ah) 
Carry with them certain responsibilities. 
 
MR. DINGLE 
Let's find ourselves a little hostelry 
Where you can sit and have a drink on me. 
We'll get a chance 
To talk about anyone who bothers us. 
 
There's so much more to life than meets the eye, 
It's quite enough to make a throat feel dry. 
So let's repair 
To where no one else would dare to bother us. 
 
Let's have a drink 
While we think what to do. 
And while we think, 
I'll accept a little drink from you. 
 
If everybody took a serious view of life, 
We all would feel the same as you. 
But, as it is, 
We don't, so it isn't gonna bother us. 
 
Let's have a drink 
While we think what to do. 
And while we think, 
I'll accept a little drink from you. 
 
MARY DEE 
Part of myself grows inside.

 (Mary Dee and Shanty's home) 
 
MARY DEE (alone in bedroom) 
The world you're coming into, 
Is no easy place to enter. 
Every day is haunted 
By the echoes of the past. 
Funny thoughts and wild; wild dreams 
Will find their way into your mind. 
 
The clouds that hang above us, 
May be full of rain and thunder. 
But in time they slide away 
To find the sun still there. 
Lazy days and wild. wild flowers 
Will bring some joy into your heart. 
And I will always love you, 
I'll welcome you into this world. 
 
MARY DEE and BOY SOLO 
You re mine and I will love you. 
 
SHANTY 
]Where s my dinner? 
I've been working hard all day 
And a man can work up quite an appetite that way. 
 
What's for dinner? 
Something nourishing and hot? 
I could tackle quite a lot of 'you know what' 
And all I've got to say to you is 'Why no dinner?' 
 
I've got nothing on my plate. 
It's expected of a mate. 
Whyd 'ya have to make me wait? 
Where's my... 
 
MARY DEE 
This is the way we put out the candle. 
Farewell to childhood. 
Deep in the wild wood a fire goes out, 
And what are we left with 
Now we are grown up? 
 
SHANTY 
This is the way we pull up the anchor. 
Goodbye to romance. 
Out on the ocean a good ship is lost, 
And what are we left with 
Now we are grown Up? 
 
MARY DEE 
Time to be thinking of real life feelings. 
I must get on. 
 
SHANTY 
Time to be buying those little trinkets 
I can't afford. 
Lord knows 
I want to give her the best. 
But where will 
I find the rest of the cash? 
 
MARY DEE 
It's one mad dash 
To fame and fortune. 
The cymbals clash 
And then you're gone. 
 
SHANTY 
So what are my chances 
Of getting promotion? 
The way things are going 
It doesn't look good. 
 
MARY DEE 
What good is complaining, 
It's getting you nowhere. 
And I'm in the middle of your whirlwind 
In the eye of your storm. 
 
SHANTY 
Let's not argue. 
 
MARY DEE 
Spare me your excuses. 
 
SHANTY 
No excuses. 
 
MARY DEE 
Pardon my anger. 
 
SHANTY 
Why are you driving me so hard? 
 
MARY DEE 
I can't believe what I'm hearing. 
 
SHANTY 
You didn't cook any dinner. 
 
MARY DEE 
I'm not a slave. 
I work for a living, 
I can command the respect of my peers. 
Where did you go? 
You were out with the boys. 
 
SHANTY 
So what if I went for a drink? 
You'd think to listen to you 
It was some sort of crime. 
 
MARY DEE 
I needed someone to talk to 
But all I could find was myself. 
If you were the same man I married, 
You'd know that your woman needs love. 
 
SHANTY 
And what about me? 
I suppose I don't matter. 
I'm not even sure 
If you ever loved me. 
 
MARY DEE 
Right! 
That's it! 
I'm off! 
 
Oh, and by the way...you're about to become a father.

Do you know who you are 
As you lie there sleeping? 
Take the time to rest your troubled head. 
I will watch over you till the moment you awake. 
 
Can you hear what I say 
As you lie there sleeping? 
When misfortunes crowd into your day 
And the dark side of life 
Has become too much to bear, 
I will stay by your side. 
Though we don't yet know if there's something wrong 
You were brought in from the street 
And a witness said you gave a shout 
As you fell down at his feet. 
 
We are running tests 
And soon the results will be known. 
But I feel I have to warn you, 
There may be complications. 
 
But we don't yet know if your child is in danger. 
We shall have to wait and see. 
In the meantime 
There is nothing more for you to do 
But sleep.

I'm not afraid of Ghosts that the past left behind. 
 
SHANTY 
Let her recover, 
Then let me love her 
Until we run out of time. 
And in the future 
I will promise to be the man 
She had in mind. 
 
NURSE 
Be still. 
Be calm. 
Your child is safe. 
 
MARY DEE 
Do we live in a world 
With an uncertain future 
Where a man is unsure of his fate? 
Will we come to our senses 
Be fair to each other? 
Can we turn it around 
Before it's too late? 
 
Do I know that we have the answer? 
Yes, I know now We are together. 
 
So we must bear in mind 
That the pages are turning 
And the sand will run out of the glass. 
In the heat of the battle 
We will drive out the demons 
And we'll carry the day, 
For we must save the child. 
 
MARY DEE and NURSE 
(Ah) 
 
MARY DEE and SHANTY 
We have come to our senses, 
We are part of each other 
And we'll carry the day, 
For we must save the child.

MARY DEE and SHANTY 
Yes, we know now. 
 
CHORUS

We know now. 
We are together.

Now, let me take you to the movies, Magg, so I can hold your hand. 
Oh, it ain't that I don't like your house, it's just that doggone man 
and that double barrel behind the door that waits for me, I know. 
Oh, climb upon old Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show. 
 
I only see her once a week and it's when my work is through. 
I break new ground the whole week long but my mind's set straight on you. 
And I polished up my old horse Beck, and she looks good, I know. 
So climb upon old Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show. 
 
Now won't you let me take you to the show so I can hold your hand. 
Oh, it ain't that I don't like your house, it's just that doggone man 
and that double barrel behind the door that waits for me, I know. 
So climb upon old Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show. 
 
Well, I break new ground all week long with my mind's set straight on you. 
And every time I try to smile, my heart it breaks in two. 
I slick myself for Saturday night cause there's one thing I know, 
I'm gonna take my Maggie dear to the western picture show. 
Now won't you let me take you to the show so I can hold your hand. 
And it ain't that I don't like your house, it's just that doggone man 
and that double barrel behind the door that waits for me, I know. 
Oh, climb upon old Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show.

MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT

 I've just seen another sunset on my own. 
All day long I've been alone, 
And I must do something about it, 
Yes I must do something about it. 
 
Played another losing cardgame with myself. 
Lonely joker on ashalf, 
And I must do something about it, 
Yes I must do something about it. 
 
No one on the party line, 
No one seems to need a dime, 
No one even knows that I'm feeling this way. 
 
I've just seen another suset on my own. 
All day long I've been alone, 
And I must do something about it, 
Yes I must do something about it. 
 
No one seems to need my vote, 
No one has to change a note, 
No one here to hold my coat, 
Oh, what a day. 
 
I've just watched another movie on t.v. 
No one's in the house but me, 
And I must do something about it, 
Yes I must do something about it. 
 
Oh, oh, something about it. 
 
I've just dialed another number on my phone. 
All day long I've been alone, 
And I must do something about it.

NAME AND ADDRESS

 Our love affair was over on the second day 
You packed a bag and like a birdie flew away 
Meanwhile I'm sitting here, I'm getting in a mess 
If you want my love, leave your name and address 
 
I used to love you baby, when I was your man 
But maybe loving you is something no one man can do 
Meanwhile I'm sitting here, I'm getting in a mess 
If you want my love, leave your name and address 
 
Love to feel the tingle of your heavenly caresses 
Love to intermingle, a lonely single without addresses 
If you want my love, leave your name and address 
 
But if it's all over baby, you know I'll understand 
Maybe I'll hate to think of you with another man 
Meanwhile I'm sitting here, I'm getting in a mess 
If you want my love, leave your name and address.

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
NINETEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE

 On no one left alive in 1985, will ever do 
She may be right 
She may be fine 
She may get love but she won't get mine 
'Cos I got you 
Oh I oh I 
Well I just can't enough of that sweet stuff 
My little lady gets behind 
 
Interlude 
 
On my mama said the time would come when I would find myself in 
Love with you 
I didn't think 
I never dreamed 
That I would be around to see it all come true 
Woh I oh I 
Well I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff 
My little lady gets behind.

But I don't want no other baby but you, I don't want no other baby but you, 
cause no other baby can thrill me like you do. 
 
Got a little woman, lives across the hall, I got a little woman, she lives across the hall 
and most every evening she's asking me to call. 
But I don't want no other baby but you, I don't want no other baby but you, 
cause no other baby can thrill me like you do. 
 
But lots of other women say be my daddy do, yeah, lots of other women say be my daddy do,

NO WORDS

 You want to give your love away 
And end up giving nothing 
I'm not surprised, that your black eyes 
Are gazing. 
 
You say that love is everything 
And what we need the most of 
I wish you knew, that's just how true 
My love was. 
 
No words for my love 
 
You're burning love, sweet burning love 
It's deep inside, 
You mustn't hide, your burning love 
Sweet burning love, your burning love. 
 
You want to turn your head away 
And someone's thinking of you 
I wish you'd see, it's only me, 
I love you. 
 
No words for my love.

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
NOBODY KNOWS

 Ooh ooh, 
They say nobody knows, nobody knows. 
 
Which one of you can tell me 
What is I'm looking at? 
Anyone who can has got to be a crazy cat. 
'Cause I believe that nobody knows, no, nobody knows. 
Yeah, nobody knows, 
Lord, I cannot tell you, 
Well, that's the way I like it, yeah now, nobody knows. 
 
Ooh uh, 
Ooh uh, 
Nobody knows, ooh uh ih, 
Oh, nobody knows, uh uh, 
Well, lord, you know that nobody knows. 
 
Samson and delilah would have made a crazy pair, 
If that silly woman hadn't shaven off his hair. 
I believe that nobody knows, 
Well, nobody knows, no, no, 
But that's the way I like it, 
Oh now, nobody knows, nobody knows, oh no. 
 
Nobody knows. 
 
Ooh uh, nobody, 
Ah, nobody, nobody knows, 
But that's the way I like it, 
That's the way I like it, nobody knows, so nobody knows. 
 
I may go hungry, maybe next week, 
Well, if I do, babe, I'll still find something to eat. 
And you know, nobody knows, 
No, nobody knows, 
Well, that's the way I like it, baby, nobody knows. 
 
And that includes you, honey, 
Nobody knows, 
I'll pay your rent, 
I'll do you right, 
Nobody knows, most every night, 
But still there's nobody knows, uh, 
No, no, nobody knows, 
And that's the way I like to keep it 
Just so nobody knows.

NOT SUCH A BAD BOY

 Yeah, er...should we try not such a bad boy? 
 Do we have to? 
 Yeah, this time, alright, one, two, three, four! 
 
 
I laughed at the teachers who taught in my school, 
They kept one armed bandits in the swimming pool. 
They don't understand me, but they never will, 
And if was there, I'd be telling them still: 
 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more, 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more, 
 
I followed the leader into her tent, 
But nobody told me that she owed some rent. 
She wanted to love me, I wanted to go. 
But she taught me things that I needed to know, you know, you know. 
 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more, 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more. 
 
Come on, boys! 
Ow! 
 
Oh yeah, she wanted to love me, I wanted to go. 
Well, she taught me things that I needed to know, she know, she know. 
 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more, 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more. 
 
I talked to my lawyer, he picked up my bail. 
Won't someone get me out of this lousy jail? 
We're both in agreement that crime never pays, 
And I should be out in a couple of days, hey! 
 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more, 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more. 
 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, (no more, no more) 
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more 
 
No more, no more, no more. 
 
Ow!

OLD SIAM SIR

 In a village in old siam, sir, 
Lived a lady who lost her way. 
In an effort to find her man, sir, 
She found herself in old u.k. 
 
She waited round in walthanstow, 
She scouted round in scarborough, 
She waited round in walthanstow, 
She skated round in scarborough. 
 
In a village in old eastham, sir, 
She met a fellow who made her reel. 
Took her rushes to show his mam, sir, 
Met his dad at the wedding meal. 
 
In a letter from old siam, sir, 
Came a terrible tale of woe. 
She decided the only answer 
Was to get up a pile of dough. 
 
She waited round in walthanstow, 
She scouted round in scarborough,

ON THE WAY

 One, two, one, two, three and a four now. 
 
Well, you know I'll always love you, 
But it would have been a lie 
If I said that I could please you, 
Ev'ry moment that I try. 
 
Wouldn't want to see you crying, 
So I hope you don't mind the things I say on the way. 
 
Well, we've been trav'ling for a long time, 
And we finally finished here. 
Though I said some things to hurt you, 
But it was only out of fear. 
 
Wouldn't want to see you crying, 
So I hope you don't mind the things I say on the way. 
 
Well, you know I'll always love you, 
Ev'rything will be alright 
If I know you don't mind the things I say on the way. 
 
If I know you don't mind the things I say on the way.

ONE MORE KISS

 Only one more kiss / I didn't mean to hurt you little girl 
Let's make it one to remember / only one more kiss 
 
I said a foolish thing last night 
I didn't think you'd take it bad 
But now I'm on my way again and just before I go 
 
Only one more kiss / I never mean to hurt you little girl 
Let's make it one to remember / only one more kiss 
 
Only one more kiss / I didn't mean to hurt you little girl 
Let's make it one to remember / only one more kiss 
 
Somebody's built a home for us 
Someday we'll see it standing there 
But like the wind that has to blow / I must be on my way 
 
Only one more kiss / I never mean to hurt you little girl 
Let's make it one to remember / only one more kiss 
Well only one more kiss.

ONE OF THESE DAYS

 One of these days when my feet are on the ground, 
I'm gonna look around and see. 
See what's right, see what's there, 
And breathe fresh air, ever after. 
 
One of these days when a job just takes too long, 
I'm gonna sing my song and see. 
See what's right, see what's there, 
And breathe fresh air, ever after. 
 
It's there, it's round, 
It's to be found, 
By you, by me, 
It's all we ever wanted to be. 
 
One of these days when we both are at our ease, 
When you've got time to please yourself. 
See what's right and see what's there, 
And breathe fresh air, ever after. 
 
It's there, it's round, 
It's to be found 
By you, by me, 
It's all we ever wanted to see. 
 
One of these days when my feet are on the ground,

ONLY LOVE REMAINS

 And if you take your love away from me, 
I'm only going to want it back. 
I'll probably pretend I didn't see, 
But knowing me, 
I want you back again and again, 
'Til the word has lost it's meaning, 
And love is all that stays. 
Only love remains. 
 
If you should ever feel that something's wrong, 
I'm gonna want to put it right, 
To bring a happy ending to our song, 
I'll carry on believing in a love. 
If your love was to trickle through my fingers, 
What would it leave me with? 
Only love remains. 
 
(only love, love remains) 
Only love (remains) 
 
Old enough and strong enough 
To stretch across the world. 
Taking the sand inside an oyster, 
Changing it into a pearl. 
Making another magic transformation, 
Find the right boy for the right girl. 
 
When all our friends have gone and we're alone, 
There's nothing left to shout about, 
Together we'll explore the great unknown. 
I'd say we won't be going out tonight, 
Let tonight be the one that we remember, 
When love is all that stays, 
Only love remains. 
When love (only love) 
Is all that stays, (love remains) 
Only love remains, 
Only love (only love) remains.

PENNY LANE

 In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs 
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know. 
And all the people that come and go 
Stop and say hello. 
 
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, 
The little children laugh at him behind his back. 
And the banker never wears a mack 
In the pouring rain, very strange. 
 
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
There beneath the blue suburban skies 
I sit, and meanwhile back 
 
In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass 
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. 
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, 
It's a clean machine. 
 
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
A four of fish and finger pies 
In summer, meanwhile back 
 
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout 
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray 
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play 
She is anyway. 
 
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, 
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim. 
And then the fireman rushes in 
From the pouring rain, very strange. 
 
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
There beneath the blue suburban skies 
I sit, and meanwhile back. 
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
There beneath the blue suburban skies, 
Penny Lane.

PICASSO'S LAST WORDS

 The grand old painter died last night 
His paintings on the wall 
Before he went he bade us well 
And said goodnight to us all. 
 
Drink to me, drink to my health 
You know I can't drink any more 
Drink to me, drink to my health 
You know I can't drink any more 
 
3 o'clock in the morning 
I'm getting ready for bed 
It came without a warning 
But I'll be waiting for you baby 
I'll be waiting for you there 
So drink to me drink to my health 
You know I can't drink any more 
Drink to me drink to my health 
You know I can't drink any more 
 
French interlude 
 
Temp change 
 
Jet... Drink to me 
 
Drunken chorus 
 
French (tempo) drink to me... Ho hey ho.

And I really am relying on your touch. 
But with all these people listening in, 
I don't know where I ought to begin. 
 
Baby, we could hit upon a word, 
Something that the others haven't heard, 
When you want me to love you, 
Just tell me to press. 
Right there, that's it, yes, 
Ah, when you feel the stress don't just stand there, 
Tell me to press. (press, press, tell me to press, tell me to press) 
 
You can give me what I want, I must confess, 
My body needs attention, my mind is in a mess, 
Oklahoma was never like this. 
Never like this, it was never like this, 
Ever like this, say was it ever like this? 
Oklahoma was never like this. 
Oh, it was never like this. 
 
Darling, I know it really wouldn't be a crime, 
If I say I want to love you all the time, mm mm. 
But with all these people listening in, 
I don't know where I ought to begin. 
 
A maybe we should have a secret code, 
Before we both get ready to explode. 
When you want me to love you, 
Well, just tell me to press. (tell me to press, tell me to press)

RICHARD CORY

 They say that richard cory owns one half of this whole town, 
With political connections to spread his wealth around. 
Born into society, a banker's only child, 
He had everything a man could want: power, grace, and style. 
 
But I work in his factory 
And I curse the life I'm living 
And I curse my poverty 
And I wish that I could be, 
Oh, I wish that I could be, 
Oh, I wish that I could be 
Richard Cory. 
 
The papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes: 
Richard cory at the opera, richard cory at a show. 
And the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht! 
Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got. 
 
But I work in his factory 
And I curse the life I'm living 
And I curse my poverty 
And I wish that I could be, 
Oh, I wish that I could be, 
Oh, I wish that I could be 
Richard Cory. 
 
He freely gave to charity, he had the common touch, 
And they were grateful for his patronage and thanked him very much, 
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read: 
 Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head. 
 
But I work in his factory 
And I curse the life I'm living 
And I curse my poverty 
And I wish that I could be, 
Oh, I wish that I could be, 
Oh, I wish that I could be 
Richard Cory.

RINSE THE RAINDROPS

 Rinse the raindrops 
From your head 
Wipe your eyes 
Go back to bed

See the sunlight 
Break the ice 
For the birds of paradise 
Listen to the song they sing

ROCK SHOW

 What's that man holding in his hand? 
He looks a lot like a guy I knew way back when 
Its silly willy with philly band 
Could be ... Oo ee ... 
 
What's that man movin' cross the stage? 
It looks a lot like the one used by jimmy page 
Its like a relic from a different age 
Could be ...Oo ee ... 
 
If there's rock show 
At the concertgebow 
They're got long hair 
At the madison square 
You've got rock and roll 
At the hollywood bowl, 
We'll be there ... Oo yeah ... 
 
The lights go down they're back in town o.k. 
Behind the stacks you glimpse an axe 
The tension mounts you score an ounce ole! 
Temperatures rise as you see the white of their eyes 
 
If there's rock show 
At the concertgebow 
You're got long hair 
At the madison square 
They've got rock and roll 
At the hollywood bowl, 
We'll be there ... Oo yeah ... 
 
In my green metal suit I'm preparing to shoot up the city 
And the ring at the end of my nose makes me look rather pretty 
Its a pity there's nobody here to witness the end 
Save for my dear old friend and confidante madamoiselle kitty 
 
What's that man movin' to and fro? 
That decibel meter doesn't seem to be reading low. 
But they was louder at the rainbow 
Could be .... Oo ee ... 
 
If there's rock show 
At the concertgebow 
They're got long hair 
At the madison square 
You got rock and roll

We'll be there ... Oo yeah ...

RUN DEVIL RUN

 (McCartney) 
 
Run devil run, the angels having fun 
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done 
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you, 
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run 
 
By a swamp in Alabama in the cold in the damp 
Sittin reading by the light of a kerosene lamp 
Lives a holly roller with a mission on her mind 
Got to spread the word to anybody she can find 
You can hear her screaming any time in night or day 
This is what she says to keep the demons away 
 
Run devil run, the angels having fun 
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done 
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you, 
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run 
 
Her brother and her sister said that she brought them down 
Steppin on the bus that was heading to town 
There they started drinking, they got into a fight 
The sheriff introduced them to the jailhouse for a night 
When the holy roller came to town to pay the bail 
This is what she sang as she was leaving the jail 
 
Run devil run, the angels having fun 
 
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done 
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you, 
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run 
 
Lead solo (8 bars) 
 
Piano (8 bars) 
 
Well by the middle of the summer they were back in the shack 
Picking cotton for a livin keep 'em on the right track 
Visiting the nieghbours trying to spread the good news 
Singing gospel music with a hint of the blues 
All of them determined to deliver the goods 
Now you you hear the music comin out on the woods 
 
Run devil run, the angel having fun 
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done 
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you, 
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run 
 
Ah you'ld better Run . . . Run Devil Run 
You better Run . . . Run Devil Run

SALLY

 Sally, Sally, pride of our alley, 
You're more than the whole world to me. 
Sally, Sally, don't ever wander 
Away from the alley and me. 
(Spoken) 
'Ladies and gentlemen, Reginald Dixon and the Blackpool Tower Orchestra. 
Come on Reg! Lovely! Lovely! Lovely! 
I love the way this boy plays, I love it! 
Marvellous, marvellous, I love it, I love it!' 
 
Oh now when you're away there are grey skies, 
And when I'm away there are even more grey skies 
Than the grey skies I talked about before. 
 
Sally, Sally, don't ever wander 
Away from the alley and me. Oh. 
 
(Spoken) 
'Thank you, thank you, thank you so much. 
Thank you, thank you so much. 
For coming here to Batley tonight. 
So lovely! 
Thank you so much!'

SALLY G

 Sowhere to the south of New York city 
Lies the friendly state of tennessee, 
Down in nashville toen I met a pretty 
Who made a pretty big fool out of me. 
 
And they call her sally, 
Sally G, why d'you wanna do the things you do to me? 
You're my sally, sally G 
Took the part that was the heart of me, sally G. 
 
The night life took me down to printers alley, 
Where sally sang a song behind a bar. 
I ran my eyes across her as she sang a tangled mime, 
I used to love to hear her sweet guitar. 
 
And they call her sally, 
Sally G, why d'you wanna do the things you do to me? 
You're my sally, sally G 
Took the part that was the heart of me, sally G. 
 
Me and sally took up, 
Things began to look up, 
Me and her were going strong. 
 
Then she started lyin', 
I could see our love was dyin'. 
I heard a voice say, 
 move along, move along . 
 
Well now. I'm on my own again, 
I wonder if she ever really understood. 
I never thought to ask her what the letter G stood for, 
But I know for sure it wasn't good. 
 
And they call her sally, 
Sally G, why d'you wanna do the things you do to me? 
You're my sally, sally G 
Took the part that was the heart of me, sally G.

SAN FERRY ANNE

 You've got a lot, 
And from what you've got, 
I'd say ou're doing well, dear. 
Dressed like a dream, 
And if things are what they seem, 
You're looking swell, dear. 
 
Your little man 
Brings you trinkets when he can, 
But he can't stay, sear. 
That's very well, 
But inside your shiny shell, 
You dance all day, dear. 
 
So go, begay, 
Let your feelings leap away 
Into the laughter. 
San ferry anne, 
And the world keeps turning happy ever after.

SAN FRANCISCO BAY BLUES

 I got the blues from my baby left me by the San Francisco Bay, 
The ocean liner's gone so far away. 
Didn't mean to treat her so bad, 
She was the best girl I ever have had, 
She said goodbye, I can take a cry, I want to lay down and die. 
 
I ain't got a nickel and I ain't got a lousy dime. 
She don't come back, think I'm going to lose my mind. 
If she ever gets back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day, 
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay. 
 
Sitting down looking from my back door, 
Wondering which way to go, 
The woman I'm so crazy about, she don't love me no more. 
Think I'll catch me a freight train, 'cause I'm feeling blue, 
And ride all the way to the end of the line, thinking only of you. 
 
Meanwhile, in another city, 
Just about to go insane, 
Thought I heard my baby, Lord, the way she used to call my name. 
If I ever get her back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day, 
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay, 
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay, 
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay.

SILLY LOVE SONGS

 You'd think that people would have had enought of silly love songs. 
But I look around me and I see it isn't so. 
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs. 
And what's wrong with that? 
I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again 
I love you, I love you, 
I love you, I love you. 
 
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; say can't you see? 
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me 
Now can't you see, what's wrong with that 
I need to know, 'cause here I go again 
I love you, I love you. 
 
Love doesn't come in a minute, 
Sometimes it doesn't come at all 
I only know that when I'm in it 
It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, love isn't silly at all. 
 
How can I tell you about my loved one? 
How can I tell you about my loved one? 
 
How can I tell you about my loved one? 
(i love you) 
How can I tell you about my loved one? 
(i love you)...

SINGING THE BLUES

 Well, I never felt more like singing the blues 
And I never thought 
that I'd ever lose your love 
Why did you do me this way? 
Well, I never felt more like crying all night 
Everything's wrong 
But nothing is right without you 
You've got me singing the blues 
Well, the moon and the stars no longer shine 
The dream is gone I thought was mine 
There's nothing left for me to do 
But cry i i i over you 
Cry over you 
Well, I never felt more like running away 
And why shouldn't I go 
'Cause I couldn't stay without you 
You've got me singing the blues. 
Well, the moon and the stars no longer shine 
The dream is gone I thought was mine 
There's nothing left for me to do 
But cry i i i over you 
Cry over you 
Well, I never felt more like running away 
And why shouldn't I go 
'Cause I couldn't stay without you 
You've got me singing the blues 
(Mr. Paul Wiggins, Come on Paul) 
Well, the moon and the stars no longer shine 
The dream is gone I thought was mine 
There's nothing left for me to do 
But cry i i i over you 
Cry over you 
Well, I never felt more like running away 
And why shouldn't I go 
'Cause I couldn't stay without you

SOME PEOPLE NEVER KNOW

 No one else will ever see 
How much faith you have in me, 
Only fools would disagree that it's so, 
Some people never know. 
 
Like a fool I'm faraway, 
Ev'ry night I hope and pray 
I'll be coming home to stay and it's so, 
Some people never know. 
 
Some people can sleep at nightime, 
Believing that love is a lie. 
I'm only a preson like you, love, 
And who in the world can be right 
All the right time. 
I know I was wrong, make me right, right. 
 
Only love can stand the test, 
Only you outshine the rest, 
Only fools take the rest, 
Only fools take second best, but it's so, 
Some people never know.

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
SOMEBODY WHO CARES

 When your body is coming apart at the seams 
And the whole thing's feeling low, 
You're convincing yourself 
That there's nobody there, I know. 
I know how you feel. 
 
Like somebody has taken the wheels off your car, 
When you had somewhere to go. 
Well, it's annoying, 
Not going to get very far, I know. 
But somebody cares. 
 
There's always someone, somewhere, 
You should know by now, 
Always somebody who cares. 
It's happening day in, day out, 
Well, you know by now, 
Always somebody who cares. 
 
If you don't know it, 
How will it find you? 
How will we know your whereabouts? 
 
But I know how you feel. 
 
I know how you feel 
 
Like somebody has taken the wheels off your car, 
When you had somewhere to go. 
Well, it's frustrating, 
Not going to get very far, I know. 
But somebody cares. 
 
There's always someone, somewhere, 
You should know by now, 
Always somebody who cares. 
It's happening day in, day out, 
Well you know by now, 
Always somebody who cares. 
 
If you don't know it, 
How will it find you? 
How will we know your whereabouts? 
 
But I know how you feel.

Somedays I look into your soul. 
 
Sometimes I laugh, 
I laugh to think how young we were. 
Sometimes it's hard, 
It's hard to know which way to turn. 
 
Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall, 
How much it cost or what it's worth. 
Sometimes I laugh, 
I laugh to think how young we were. 
 
We don't need anybody else 
To tell us what is real. 
Inside each one of us is love, 
And we know how it feels. 
 
Somedays I cry, 
I cry for those who live in fear. 
Somedays I don't, 
I don't remember why I'm here. 
 
No use reminding me, it's just the way it is, 
Who ran the race and came in first. 
Somedays I cry, 
I cry for those who fear the worst.

SPIN IT ON

 This is it! 
 
Spin it on, don't stop, 
Take it back to the top, 
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you. 
I wanna spin it on. 
 
Spin it on! 
Off to the flicks with the piddle in her mix, 
To the fair with her hair in curlers. 
Her cousin couldn't get down to the pleasure dome, 
Her cousin had to spend the night in an aircraft hangar, memories. 
 
Spin it on, don't stop, 
Take it back to the top, 
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you. 
That's why I wanna spin it on.

Went off to the field with a missionary's zeal 
For the life of a wife of a farmer. 
Her cousin couldn't get on down to the village hall, 
Her cousin had to spend the night on a pinball table, memories. 
 
Spin it on, don't stop, 
Take it back to the top, 
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you. 
That's why I wanna spin it on.

SPINNING ON AN AXIS

 World spinning round 
To the next revolution 
Sun going down 
Gonna rise up again 
 
I watch the sun go down 
With some sorrow 
And now I know it's gonna come back tomorrow 
Ain't no reason 
It has to do that 
It's the season of the culture bat 
 
Spinning on an axis 
Spinning on an axis 
Staring in the face 
Of time and space 
Spinning on an axis 
 
World spinning round 
To the next revolution 
Sun going down 
Gonna rise up again 
 
Hear me rising 
Rise up and sing, rise up, rise up 
 
Although I'm curious 
It isn't a crime 
I want to know if I'll 
Find out in time 
A lot of people busy doing their thing 
Gonna wake up and sing 
 
Spinning on an axis 
Spinning on an axis 
We ask the question 
And the answer's yes 
Spinning on an axis 
 
I watch the sun go down 
With some sorrow 
And now I know it's gonna come back tomorrow 
Ain't no reason why 
It has to do that 
It's the season of the culture bat 
 
I watch the sun go down 
Wonder if it's gonna come back 
Certainly there's no guarantee 
But I got a feeling it will be 
Spinning on an axis 
Spinning on an axis 
Spinning on an axis 
Spinning on, Spinning on an axis 
Spinning on an axis 
 
World spinning round 
To the next revolution 
Sun going down 
Gonna rise up again

 You're my baby and I love you

I'm your baby do you love me? 
I can drive a cadillac 
Across the irish sea 
But when I've finished doing that

'Cos I'm your baby, and you love me.

You were always a very good dancer.

TALK MORE TALK

 A master can highlight the phrases, 
Sleazy instruments, half talked, half baked ideas... 
Dad, you didn't say ok...ha, ha... 
The window was open, outside was a spaceship, 
(and a master can highlight the phrases) 
It took off into the sky leaving a trail of smoke behind it... 
 
Short of standard, was it the sum? 
What was rehearsal? Conventional drum? 
Not quite a hundred. Less than a ton. 
Clearly the time came, the plan had begun 
 
With talk, more talk, 
Chat, more chat. 
Words of a feather are worn in a hat. 
Talk, more talk, chat, more chat, 
I'm happy to do it for you. 
 
Developed since earlier days at the school, 
Cheapest sensations was used as a rule. 
Outstanding to mem'ry, major free flow, 
Bio degradable, look out below for 
 
Talk, more talk, 
Oh, I love to hear the gentle sound 
Of conversation sprinkled around 
A room where I can be at one with you for 
 
More talk, more talk, talkie talk, talkie talk, 
Chat, more chat, chatie chatie chat. 
Words of a feather are worn in a hat. 
Talk, more talk, chat, more chat, 
Happy to do it for you.

I'm happy to do it, I'm happy to do it, 
I'm happy to do it for you, yeah yi yeah. 
 
Digital organ, finishing stretch, 
Instrumentation, analogue gretsch. 
Not quite a thousand, lower than that. 
Possible bargain for listening at that 
 
Talk, more talk, 
Chat, more chat. 
Words of a feather are worn in a hat. 
Talk, more talk, chat, more chat. 
I'm happy to do it for you. 
 
All you want is a handyman 
And all you want is quick service. 
Because I'm a house owner. 
I am a house owner. 
It may be worth something some day. 
I hear water going through the pipes. 
I don't actually like sitting down music. 
Music is ideas. 
 
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. 
 
Talk, more talk, oh, 
Chat, more chat. 
Words of a feather are worn in a hat. 
Talk, more talk, chat, more chat.

Words of a feather are worn in a hat.

I Thought At Once My Heart Would Burst, 
Still, Every Time Is Like The First. 
There Was Applause When She Stepped Up. 
I Wished That I Could Interrupt 
I Made No Sign, I Made No Sound 
I Know I Must Stay Underground. 
That Day Is Done, That Day Is Done. 
You Know Where I've Gone 
I Won't Be Coming Back, 
That Day Is Done. 
That's Why She Walks, Or So They Say. 
She Always Knew Just What I Needed 
Now If She Would, Just Look My Way 
One Time Before They Proceed. 
She Sprinkles Flowers In The Dirt 
That's When A Thrill Becomes A Hurt, 
I Know I'll Never See Her Face. 
She Walks Away From My Resting Place. 
That Day Is Done, That Day Is Done.

 Day after day alone on the hill

And he never seem to notice 
 
But the fool on the hill 
sees the sun going down 
And the eyes in his head 
See the world spinning round 
 
Well on the way, his head in a cloud 
The man of a thousand voices 
is talking perfectly loud 
But nobody ever hears him 
Or the sound he appears to make 
And he never seems to notice 
 
But the fool on the hill

And the eyes in his head 
See the world spinning round

And he never shows his feelings 
 
But the fool on the hill

All my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way 
That was up until today 
Oh it had to be this way 
 
Today, wait until the morning comes 
Before you slip away 
Without permission 
Without suspicion 
Without permission given 
 
You seem to have a friendlier smile than all the rest 
Well I looked and you were best 
Yeah i've looked at all the rest 
You can't imagine passionate words that I would say 
If only you would stay 
Oh you know you gotta stay 
 
Today, wait until the morning comes 
Before you slip away 
Without permission 
Without suspicion 
Without permission given 
 
You used to be and early bird 
But how was I to know you would leave without shedding a tear 
I only want to love you 
I'll make a wish and suddenly I'm glad that I have you here 
Oh I'm glad I have you here 
Today 
 
To me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day 
And you can't take that away 
No, you can't take that away 
All my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way 
That was up until today 
Yeah, it had to be this way 
 
Today, wait until the morning comes 
Before you slip away, today 
Before you slip away 
Without permission 
Without suspicion 
Without permission given to you, ah

THE LOVERS THAT NEVER WERE

 I Have Always Needed Somebody Girl, 
But I Close The Doors To Keep Out The World. 
But For You, I Would Be Here All Alone, 
Locked In A Photograph. 
All Of The Clocks Have Run Down. 
Lover Beware. 
We'll Be The Lovers That Never Were. 
 
I Hang Patiently On Every Word You Send. 
Will We Ever Be Much More Than Just Friends? 
As For You, You Sit There Playing This Game, 
You Keep Me Waiting 
When All Of The Clocks Have Run Down, 
All Over The World. 
We'll Be The Lovers That Never Were. 
 
For As Long As The Sun Shines In Somebody's Eyes, 
I Believe In You Baby, So Don't Tell Me Lies. 
For As Long As The Trees Throw Down Blossoms And Leaves, 
I Know There Will Be A Parade Of Unpainted Dreams. 
 
And I Know Dear, How Much It's Going To Hurt 
If You Still Refuse To Get Your Hands Dirty. 
So You, You Must Tell Me Something,...I Love You, 
Say Goodbye Or Anything. 
All Of The Clocks Have Run Down. 
Time's At An End. 
If We Can't Be Lovers We'll Never Be Friends. 
 
For As Long As The Sun Shines In Somebody's Eyes, 
I Believe In You Baby, So Don't Tell Me Lies. 
For As Long As The Trees Throw Down Blossoms And Leaves, 
I Know There Will Be A Parade Of Unpainted Dreams.

THE MAN

 There's a man, 
Who plays the game of life so well, 
Oo, there's such a man, 
His thoughts you can never tell. 
Oo, and it's just the way he thought it would be, 
'Cause the day has come for him to be free, 
Then he laughs, he kicks, then rolls up his sleeves, 
I'm alive and I'm here forever, 
This is the man. 
 
And it's just the way he thought it would be, 
'Cause the day has come for him to be free, 
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves, 
I'm alive and I'm here forever, 
This is the man. 
 
There's a man, 
Ev'rybody thought they knew, 
Oo, there's such a man, 
He's not like me and you. 
Oo, and it's just the way she thought it would be, 
And he says, something has happened to me. 
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves, 
I'm alive and I'm here forever, 
This is the man. 
 
And it's just the way he thought it would be, 
'Cause the day has come for him to be free, 
And he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves, 
I'm alive and I'm here forever, 
This is the man. 
 
Did you know, 
This man can do anything? 
Oo, there's such a man, 
I wish that we could bring. 
Oo, and it's just the way he thought it would be,

 You sailed away one night in june

THE NOTE YOU NEVER WROTE

 Later on, the story goes, 
A bottle floated out to sea. 
After days, when it had found the perfect spot, 
It opened up, 
And I read the note that you never wrote to me 
 
After all, I'm sure you know, 
The mayor of baltimore is here. 
After days now he can finally appear, 
Now at last he's here, 
 
But he never is gonna get my vote, 
'Cause he never is gonna get a quote 
From the little note 
That you never wrote to me. 
 
Further on, along the line, 
I was arrested on the shore, 
Holding papers of governments galore. 
I was taken in, 
 
But I read the note that you never wrote. 
Yes, I read the note that you never wrote. 
Oh, I read the note that you never wrote to me. 
 
To me. 
To me. 
To me.

 

PAUL MCCARTNEY
THE OTHER ME

 I know I was a crazy fool, 
For treating you the way I did. 
But something got a hold of me 
And I acted like a dustbin lid. 
 
I didn't give second thought 
To what the consequence might be. 
I really wouldn't be surprised 
If you were tryin' to find another me. 
 
'Cause the other me would rather be the glad one, 
The other me would rather play the fool. 
I wanna be the kind of me 
That doesn't let you down as a rule. 
 
I know it doesn't take a lot 
To have a little self control, 
But every time that I forgot, 
Well, I landed in another hole. 
 
But ev'rytime you pull me out, 
I find it harder not to see, 
That we can build a better life 
If I can try to find the other me, mm mm. 
 
The other me would rather be the glad one, 
Yeh, the other me would rather play the fool. 
Said, I wanna be the kind of me 
That doesn't let you down as a rule. 
 
But if I ever hurt you, 
Well, you know that it's not real. 
It's not easy living by yourself, 
So imagine how I feel. 
 
I wish that I could take it back, 
I'd like to make a diff'rent mode. 
And if you let me try again, 
I'll have a better attitude. 
 
Well, I know that one and one make two, 
And that's what I want us to be. 
I really would appreciate it, 
If you'd help me find the other me. 
 
Uh uh, yeah, yeah. 
 
Well, the other me would rather be the glad one, 
The other me rather play the fool. 
But I wanna be the kind of me 
That doesn't let you down as a rule. 
 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
 
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo, 
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo, 
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo, 
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, 
 
The other me would rather be the glad one, 
And the other me would rather play the fool. 
And I wanna be the kind of me 
Who doesn't let you down as a rule.

THE POUND IS SINKING

 The pound is sinking, 
The peso's failing, 
The lira's reeling, 
And feeling quite appalling. 
 
The mark is holding, 
The franc is fading, 
The drachma's very weak 
But ev'ryone's still trading. 
 
The market's bottom has fallen right out 
And only the strong are survivors. 
 
Well I fear, my dear, that it's eminently clear, 
That you can't see the trees for the forest. 
Your father was an extraordinary man, 
But you don't seem to have inherited 
Many of his mannerisms. 
 
Oh, any of his mannerisms. 
 
The dollar's moving, 
The rouble's rising. 
The yen is keeping up 
Which hardly seems surprising. 
 
The market's bottom has fallen right out 
And only the strong are survivors. 
 
Hear me, my lover, (hear me, my lover) 
I can't be held responsible now, (oh no, it wasn't me) 
For something that didn't happen (i didn't do it and you knew it) 
I knew you for a minute, 
Oh, it didn't happen, only for a minute, 
Your heart just wasn't in it any more, mm mm mm. 
 
The pound is sinking, 
The peso's failing, 
The lira's reeling, 
And feeling quite appalling. 
 
Uh, uh, uh.

THE SONG WE WERE SINGING

 For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe 
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life 
We could jaw through the night 
 
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like 
Oh yeah 
 
But we always came back to the songs we were singing 
At any particular time 
Yeah we always came back to the songs we were singing 
At any particular time 
 
Take a sip, see the world through a glass 
And speculate about the cosmic solution 
To the sound, blue guitars 
Caught up in a philosophical discussion 
 
Oh yeah 
 
But we always came back to the songs we were singing 
At any particular time 
Yeah we always came back to the songs we were singing

THE WORLD TONIGHT

 I saw you sitting at the center of a circle 
Everybody, 
Everybody wanted something from you 
I saw you sitting there 
 
I saw you swaying to the rhythm of the music 
Caught you playing 
Caught you praying to the voice inside you 
I saw you swaying there 
 
I don't care what you want to be 
I go back so far, I'm in front of me 
It doesn't matter what they say 
They're giving the game away 
 
I can see the world tonight 
Look into the future 
See it in a different light 
I can see the world tonight 
 
I heard you listening to a secret conversation 
You were crying 
You were trying not to let them hear you 
I heard you listening in 
 
Never mind what they want to do 
You got a right, to your point of view 
It doesn't matter what they say 
They're giving the game away 
 
I can see the world tonight 
Look into the future 
See it in a different light 
I can see the world tonight 
 
I saw you hiding from a flock of paparazzi 
You were hoping 
You were hoping that the ground would swallow you 
I saw you hiding there 
 
I don't care what you want to be 
I go back so far, I'm in front of me 
It doesn't matter what they say 
They're giving the game away 
 
I can see the world tonight 
Look into the future 
See it in a different light 
I can see the world tonight 
 
Look into the future 
 
I can see the world tonight

THINGS WE SAID TODAY

 You say you will love me 
If I have to go. 
You'll be thinking of me, 
Somehow I will know. 
Someday when I'm lonely, 
Wishing you weren't so far away, 
Then I will remember 
The things we said today. 
You say you'll be mine, girl, 
Until the end of time. 
These days such a kind girl 
Seems so hard to find. 
Someday when we're dreaming, 
Deep in love, not a lot to say. 
Then we will tremember 
The things we said today. 
Me, I'm just the lucky kind. 
Love to hear you say that love is luck. 
And, though we may be blind, 
Love is here to stay. And that's enough 
To make you mine, girl, 
Be the only one. 
Love me all the time, girl. 
We'll go on and on.

THROUGH OUR LOVE

 We wasted time and again, 
On things, things we already knew. 
Born to do, I give my love to you. 
 
Whenever you get some time, 
Whenever you get some time, 
I'd like to roll it all up in ball, 
And spend it with you. 
You've got the power of love 
And love has the power to make it come true. 
 
We can go through our love, 
We can do things that they said were impossible. 
Through our love, 
We can do all that we want to do. 
We can go through our love, 
We can go through our love. 
 
Yeah. 
 
Whenever you will be mine, 
Whenever you will be mine, 
I wanna to be with you, 
Just wanna do whatever feels right. 
You've got the power of love 
And love has the power to turn on the light. 
 
Here we go through our love, 
We can see things that they said were invisible. 
Through our love, 
We can see where we are going to. 
We're going through our love, 
Through our love we can learn to do things 
That they said were impossible. 
Through our love, 
We can be blessed with a better view. 
We can go through our love, 
We can go through our love, 
We can go through our love.

 You don't feel right when I come on strong, 
Don't get me wrong. 
I wait all night but you won't be long, 
Don't get me wrong. 
 
Hear me right, 
I love you from the bottom of my heart, 
You make the answer bright. 
You touch me in a way that no one else could ever do, 
If you'll only love me, 
I'll love you. 
 
And if you're tempted to tell a lie, 
Don't get it wrong. 
Well, it breaks my heart when I see you cry, 
Don't get it wrong. 
 
Get it right, 
The brightest light that's shining in the skies, 
Is shining from your eyes. 
I love you in a way that no one else could ever do, 
If you'll only love me, 
I'll love you. 
 
I'm often accused of giving to little, 
It's got me confused, I'm split down the middle, 
Conflicting reviews of our life coming in. 
It's tough on a tightrope,

TREAT HER GENTLY LONELY PEOPLE

 Treat her gently 
Treat her kind 
She doesn't even know her own mind 
 
Treat her simply 
Take it slow 
Make it easy 
And let her know 
You'll never find another way 
 
Here we sit 
Two lonely old people 
Eaking our lives away 
 
Bit by bit 
Two lonely old people 
Keeping the time of day 
 
Here we sit 
Out of breath 
And nobody asked us to play 
 
 old people's home for the play 
Nobody asked us to play 
 
Treat her gently 
Treat her kind 
She doesn't even know her own mind 
 
Treat her simply 
Make it slow 
Take it easy 
And let her know 
You'll never find another way

It's a tug of war, 
Though I know I mustn't grumble, 
It s a tug of war. 
But I can't let go, 
If I do, you'll take a tumble 
And the whole thing is going to crumble, 
It's a tug of war. 
 
In years to come, they may discover 
What the air we breathe and the life we lead are all about. 
But it won't be soon enough, (soon enough) 
Soon enough for me. 
No, it won't be soon enough, (it won't be soon enough for me)

TWENTY FLIGHT ROCK

 Well I got a girl with a record machine, 
When it comes to rocking she's a queen. 
I took her to a dance on a saturday night, 
All alone where I can hold her tight. 
She lives on the twentieth floor uptown. 
The elevator's broken down. 
 
And I walk one, two flight, three flight four, 
Five six seven flight, eight flight more. 
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag, 
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag. 
I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock. 
 
You know she called me up on the telephone, 
Said come on ever baby 'cause I'm all alone. 
I said baby you're mighty sweet, 
But I'm in bed with aching feet. 
This went on for a couple of days, 
But I couldn't stay away. 
 
And I walk one, two flight, three flight four, 
Five six seven flight, eight flight more. 
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag, 
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag. 
I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock. 
 
Well I sent to Chicago for repairs, 
Till it's fixed I'm using the stairs. 
I hope they hurry, before it's too late, 
I want my baby too much to wait. 
All this climbing is getting me down, 
They'll find me hanging over the rail.

TWICE IN A LIFETIME

 Now I know that it can easily happen to some like me 
 
I don't want to step on anybody's toes. 
Who knows how to find love? 
Think before you give your answer. 
Who knows what a mystery may bring. 
 
Once in a life, I'm a lucky man, 
If I can find the kind of love 
That's gonna last for me. 
 
Twice in a lifetime, 
Is one of those unspoken dreams 
We usually reserve for fantasy. 
 
Who knows how we find love? 
Stop before you give your answer. 
Who knows when a mystery begins?

I know because it's happening to me,

WILD LIFE

 The world wild applies to the words you and me . 
 
While take a walk thru an african park one day, 
I saw a sign say, the animals have the right of way . 
 
Wild life, whatever happened to, 
Wild life, the animals in the zoo? 
 
We're breathing a lot, 
A lot of political nonsense in the air. 
 
You're making it hard for the people who live in there. 
You're moving so fast, but, baby, you know not where. 
Wild life, (wild life), what's gonna happen to 
Wild life, (wild life), the animals in the zoo? 
 
You'd better stop, there's animals ev'rywhere, 
And man is the top, an animal too, 
And, man, you just got to care. 
 
Wild life, what's gonna happen to,

 Doctor Tom is getting on, 
All he does is sign his name. 
I get things my brainbox sings, 
But I'll go down again. 
 
Play with fire, getting higher, 
Higher than a nine foot flame. 
My soul is pent and so's the rent, 
But I'll go down again. 
 
Wino junko can't say no, 
Wino junko, eyes aglow. 
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no 
Till you go down again 
 
This and treat you crazy cat, 
Flying sideways once again. 
I'm in a spin it makes me grin, 
But I'll go down again. 
 
Wino junko can't say no, 
Wino junko, eyes aglow. 
Pill freak, spring a leak, you can't say no 
Till you go down again. 
 
Till you go down again. 
Till you go down again. 
Till you go down. 
 
Take what I need until I bleed, 
People will say I've gone insane. 
Ain't scared to die, it's such a high, 
Till I go down again.

I can forget the airs and graces

(So Why Don't You Come Right Out And Say It, Stupid)? 
She Makes Me Do Things I Don't Want To Do, 
I Don't Know Why I Should Be Telling You 
I Know That You Want Her Too. 
My Intentions Are Quite Sincere, 
(That's Not What You Said The Other Night) 
And All You Can Do Is Sneer, 
(Go Ahead And Kid Yourself You're Right) 
She Makes Me Do Things I Don't Want To Do, 
I Don't Know Why I Should Be Telling You 
I Know That You Want Her Too. 
I've Got A Better Chance Than You Do, 
I Know That You Want Her Too. 
You're Such A Hopeless Romantic 
She Told Me You're So Predictable And Nice, 
She Only Did You A Favour Once Or Twice, 
Once Or Twice. 
She Makes Me Go So Wrong. 
(So Why Don't You Lie Back And Enjoy It)? 
My Conscience Is Clear And Strong 
(Yes She Says I'm Just The Boy For It). 
She Makes Me Do Things I Don't Want To Do, 
I Don't Know Why I Should Be Telling You 
I Know That You Want Her Too, 
I Know That You Want Her Too, 
I Know That You Want Her Too.

YOUNG BOY

 He's just a young boy Looking for a way to find love 
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him, Find love 
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long 
He just a young boy Looking for a way to find love 
 
He doesn't need another helping hand from someone 
But don't you think he doesn't understand what he wants, Someone 
Though independence means a lot he got to still be strong 
He just a young boy Looking for a way to find love 
 
Find Love, a perfect combination 
Find Love, whatever you do 
Find Love, a cause for celebration 
Then it might come looking, come looking for you 
 
Find love in any situation 
Find Love, whatever you do 
Find Love, a cause for celebration 
And it might come looking, come looking for you 
 
He's just a young boy Looking for a way to find love 
It isn't easy nothing you can say will help him, Find love 
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long 
He's just a young boy Looking for a way to find love 
 
Find love, a time for meditation 
Find love, a source for inspiration 
Find love, instead of confrontation 
And love will come looking for you

YOUR LOVING FLAME

 How can I hope to reach your love 
Help me to discover 
What it is you're thinking of 
 
'Cos when we kiss, nothing feels the same 
I could spend eternity 
Inside your loving flame 
 
What am I to do 
If I don't have you 
I'll be feeling blue 
Just sitting here without you 
You could be the one 
To chase my blues away, away 
 
So tell me how, how to reach your love 
Help me to discover 
What it is you're thinking of 
 
'Cos when we kiss, nothing feels the same 
I could spend eternity 
Inside your loving flame 
 
What am I to do 
If I don't have you 
I'll be feeling blue 
Just sitting here without you 
You could be the one 
To chase my blues away, away 
 
'Cos when we kiss, nothing feels the same 
I could spend eternity 
Inside your loving flame 
 
So tell me how, how to reach your love 
Help me to discover 
What it is you're thinking of 
 
How can I hope to reach your love 
Here forever in your loving flame

YOUR WAY

 I like it 
Please don't take my heart away 
It's happy 
Where it is so let it stay 
You gave me love 
You gave me what I wanted 
You gave me love your way 
 
I've seen it 
Shining from the furthest stars 
Like Venus 
Saw it on the way to Mars 
You gave me love 
You gave me what I wanted 
You gave me love your way 
 
Your way is strong 
You way is right 
Your way is mine tonight 
 
I like it 
Please don't take my heart away 
It's happy 
Where it is so let it stay 
You gave me love 
You gave me what I wanted 
You gave me love your way 
 
Your way is strong 
You way is right 
Your way is mine tonight 
 
Your way is strong 
You way is right 
Your way is mine tonight 
 
You gave me love your way
