ANIMAL INSTINCT

 Suddenly something has happened to me 
As I was having my cup of tea 
Suddenly I was feeling depressed 
I was utterly and totally stressed 
Do you know you made me cry 
Do you know you made me die 
 
And the thing that gets to me 
Is you'll never really see 
And the thing that freaks me out 
Is I'll always be in doubt 
It is a lovely thing that we have 
It is a lovely thing that we 
It is a lovely thing, the animal 
The animal instinct 
 
So take my hands and come with me 
We will change reality 
So take my hands and we will pray 
They won't take you away 
They will never make me cry, no 
They will never make me die 
And the thing that gets to me 
Is you'll never really see 
And the thing that freaks me out 
Is I'll always be in doubt 
 
The animal, the animal, 
the animal instinct in me 
It's the animal, the animal, 
the animal instinct in me 
It's the animal, it's the animal, 
it's the animal instinct in me x2

BOSNIA

 I would like to state my vision 
Life was so unfair 
We live in our secure surroundings 
And people die out there 
 
Bosnia, was so unkind 
Sarejevo, change my mind 
And we all call out in despair 
All the love we need isn't there 
And we all sing songs in our rooms 
Sarejevo erects another tomb 
 
Sarejevo! Sarejevo! Sarejevo! Sarejevo! 
Bosnia, was so unkind 
Sarejevo! Sarejevo! Sarejevo! 
Bosnia, was so unkind 
 
Sure, things would change 
If we really wanted them to 
No fear for children anymore 
There are babies in their beds 
Terror in their heads 
for the love of life!

CAROUSEL

 River side, river run 
I take my tea at one 
With coffee and some cigarettes 
I watch you dare out the sun 
I rule this town with poisoned wells 
But with lovers running parallel 
Angel dust I'm all mixed up 
I think I'm running towards the carousel 
 
Sweetened like a sweetened cherry 
Bury me beneath the hills 
Whispering with their bare trees 
I will array my conspiracy 
I'll wash away all the dirty 
Scorch it on a blue heart flame 
Settle under a riverbed 
Never to come back again 
 
I dig a hole, I dig a well 
I try to save me from myself 
I think I could I think I will 
I think I'm running towards a carousel

Just like me they long to be 
Close to you 
 
On the day that you were born 
the angels got together 
They decided to create a dream come true 
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair 
and put the starlight in your eyes so blue 
 
That is why all the girls in town 
follow you all around

FREE TO DECIDE

 It's not worth anything more than this at all 
I live as I choose or I will not live at all 
 
So return to where you've come from 
Return to where you dwell 
Because harassment's not my forte 
But you do it very well 
 
I'm Free To Decide, I'm free to decide 
And I'm not so suicidal after all 
I'm Free To Decide, I'm free To decide 
And I'm not so suicidal after all (at all, at all) 
 
You must have nothing more with your mind to do 
There's a war in Russia and Sarejevo, too 
 
So to hell with want you're thinking 
And to hell with your narrow mind 
You're so distracted from the real thing 
You should leave your life behind (behind) 
 
I'm Free To Decide, I'm free to decide 
And I'm not so suicidal after all 
I'm Free To Decide, I'm free to decide 
And I'm not so suicidal after all (at all, at all) 
 
I'm Free To Decide, I'm free to decide 
And I'm not so suicidal after all (at all, at all)

GO YOUR OWN WAY

 Loving you 
Isn't the right thing to do 
How can I ever change things 
That I feel 
 
If I could 
Maybe I'd give you my world 
How can I 
When you won't take it from me 
 
You can go your own way 
Go your own way 
You an call it 
Another lonely day 
You can go your own way 
Go your own way 
 
Tell me why 
Everything turned around 
Packing up 
Shacking up is all you wanna do 
 
If I could 
Baby I'd give you my world 
Open up 
Everything's waiting for you 
 
You can go your own way 
Go your own way 
You an call it 
Another lonely day 
You can go your own way 
go your own way...

I JUST SHOT JOHN LENNON

 It was the fearful night of December 8th 
He was returning home from the studio, late 
He had perceptively known that it wouldn't be nice 
Because in 1980, he paid the price 
 
John Lennon died, John Lennon died, John Lennon died 
John Lennon died, John Lennon died, John Lennon died 
 
With a Smith & Wesson, 38 
John Lennon's life was no longer a debate 
He should have stayed at home 
he should have never cared 
And the man who took his life declared, he said: 
 
 I Just Shot John Lennon! 
He said: I Just Shot John Lennon! 
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight 
It was a sad and sorry and sickening night 
 
Oh a sad and sorry and sickening sight 
It was a sad and sorry and sickening night 
 
 I Just Shot John Lennon! 
He said, I Just Shot John Lennon! 
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight

I try to remain 
I'm trying not to go insane 
I need your affection all the way 
 
I'm still remembering my life 
Before I became your wife 
I'm still remembering the pain 
And the mind games 
Reverse psychology, never tainted me 
I didn't sell my soul, I didn't sell my soul

The world has changd or I've changed in a way 
I try to remain 
I'm trying not to go insane 
I need your affection all the way

Rise to the top

Will his presence still remain 
Remember J.F.K. 
Ever saintly in a way 
 
Where are you now 
Where are you now

A love song so divine

If I broke down and cried? If I cried?

I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do 
Oh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it

If I could stick a knife in my heart 
Suicide right on stage 
Would it be enough for your teenage lust 
Would it help to ease the pain? Ease your brain? 
 
If I could dig down deep in my heart 
Feelings would flood on the page 
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya 
Would ya think the boy's insane? He's insane

 There was a game we used to play 
We would hit the town on Friday night

Living not for reality 
 
It was just my imagination x3 
There was a time I used to pray 
I have always kept my faith in love 
It's the greatest thing from the man above 
The game I used to play 
I've always put my cards upon the table 
Let it never be said that I'd be unstable 
 
It was just my imagination x3 
 
There is a game I like to play 
I like to hit the town on Friday night

You'll always be special to me

things we once shared 
Watching movies on 
the living room armchair 
 
But they say it will work out fine 
Was it all a waste of time 
Cause I knew, I knew, I'd lose you 
 
You'll always be special to me 
 
Will you forget in time 
You said I was on your mind 
There's no need to argue 
No need to argue anymore 
There's no need to argue anymore 
Special

NOTHING LEFT AT ALL

 Know it's over but the thoughts of you go on 
Nothing here, nothing left at all 
 
How I swore that I would never feel like this again 
But then you, you brought it through 
 
Oh no, is there any reason why I should walk away 
Is it wrong, is it wrong to want to stay 
 
And I know if I had the choice I would never let you 
go 
Do you know, do you really want to know 
 
Well now the thoughts of you just circle in my mind 
Hard to find, you were really hard to find 
 
Oh and although, though I swore I'd never feel like 
this again 
I can't take it anymore 
 
Because I know if I had the choice I'd never let you go 
Do you know, do you really want to know 
 
And I didn't think, I didn't think I'd think about you in this way 
Well really, you really made my day 
 
Now, now it's over but the thoughts of you go on 
Nothing here, nothing left at all

He's eighteen years old

We used to have a life, 
but now it's all gone.

Does it have to be so cold in Ireland?

Look what they've done to me. 
They've taken my hand... 
And it's killing me. 
Killing me, killing me, killing me! 
 
Does it have to be so cold in Ireland?

It wasn't often 
 
We wore Doc Martens in the snow 
Paint our toenails black and let our hair grow 
What I am now is what I was then 
I am not more acceptable than them 
I am not more acceptable than them 
 
It wasn't often, that we'd fight at all 
It wasn't often 
It wasn't often, that we'd fight at all 
It wasn't often 
 
It wasn't often, it wasn't often 
It wasn't often, it wasn't often 
It wasn't often, it wasn't often 
It wasn't often, it wasn't often 
 
Seems like yesterday we were sixteen 
We were The Rebels of the Rebel Scene 
 


 

CRANBERRIES
THE SUN DOES RISE

 Nightime has gone when all was still 
Moon shone the way as we climbed the hill 
When we arrived we raised our hands 
Now the dawn has come now we understand 
The sun does rise in the eastern sky 
and love soon comes watch over I 
The road was long yes we travelled far 
Through long dark nights without guiding star 
Visions of an angel came along the way 
Told us don't be fearful for there comes a brighter day 
This journey's been an epic 
Sometimes I've been so down 
Stranded in a lonely bar the other side of town 
Yes we've travelled day and night for many a pour mile 
Now it all makes sense as we see the morning smile

THEM

 Don't listen to what they say 
Make up your mind, walk away 
Oh don't even give them the time of day 
They put you wrong, turn away 
 
So why'd they all just walk away 
There was something wrong 
But you don't want to say 
 
Oh why did they listen to someone else 
I did something wrong 
Something 
 
Oh that attitude 
They all got that attitude 
 
Something they say 
Make up your mind, walk away 
Oh oh never happen again 
They've all gone wrong, gone insane 
 
That's why they all just walked away 
There was nothing wrong 
Didn't want to say

WALTZING BACK

 Who gave them the right 
Waltzing back into your life (your life, your life) 
Now I feel fear 
I wish that they'd never come here (here, here) 
 
What they gonna do 
What they gonna say 
Taking you away 
From my life (my life, my life) 
 
Say, what they gonna do 
What they gonna say 
Taking you away 
From my life (my life, my life)

WANTED

 Sitting in an armchair 
with my head between my hands 
I wouldn't have to be like this 
if you'd only understand 
Too many misunderstandings 
causing such delay 
And if it doesn't work like this 
Well, I'll try another way 
 
Oh, if this is the way you wanted it 
oh, I didn't understand 
Oh, if this is the way you wanted it 
oh, I didn't understand 
 
You know that all I wanted 
was to be there by your side 
And if you didn't want it 
Well, you should have denied 
You knew that you were someone special 
right form the start 
But if you treat me badly 
We'd be better off apart 
 
Oh, if this is the way you wanted it 
oh, I didn't understand 
Oh, if this is the way you wanted it 
oh, I didn't understand 
Understand

WAR CHILD

 Who will save the war child baby 
Who controls the keys 
The web we weave is thick and sordid 
Fine by me 
 
At times of war 
We're all the losers 
There's no victory 
We'll shoot to kill, and kill your lover 
Fine by me 
 
War Child 
Victim of political pride 
Plant the seed, territorial greed 
Mind, the war child. 
We should mind, the war child 
 
I spent last winter in New York 
And came upon a man 
He was sleeping on the streets and homeless 
He said, I fought in Vietnam 
 
Beneath his shirt he wore the mark 
He bore the mark of pride 
A two inch deep incision carved 
Into his side 
 
War Child! 
Victim of political pride 
Plant the seed, territorial Greed 
Mind, the war child 
We should mind, the war child 
 
Whose the loser now 
Whose the loser now 
We're all the losers now 
We're all the losers now

WHAT YOU WERE

 Now it's easy for to see 
Why people's life are so lonely 
And you never understood 
You never really could, you were wrong 
 
What you were, what you were 
I couldn't say 
'Cause you left me here behind 
A stupid state of mind, and I'm lonely 
 
Yeah, you left me here behind 
A stupid state of mind, and you're gone 
 
Cos you left me here behind 
A stupid state of mind, and you're gone 
 
What you were, what you were 
I couldn't say 
It took something hard like this 
Mistaken to resist, and I'm lonely

WHEN YOU'RE GONE

 Hold on to love, that is what I do 
Now that I've found you 
And from above, everything's stinking 
When they're not around you 
 
And in the night, I could be helpless 
I could be lonely, sleeping without you 
And in the day, everything's complex 
There's nothing simple, when I'm not around you 
 
But I miss you when you're gone 
That is what I do, Baby, Baby 
And it's going to carry on, 
That is what I knew, Baby, Baby 
 
Hold on to my hands 
I feel I'm sinking, sinking without you 
And to my mind, everything's stinking 
Stinking without you 
 
And in the night, I could be helpless 
I could be lonely, sleeping without you 
And in the day, everything's complex 
There's nothing simple, when I'm not around you

That is what I do, Baby, Baby

WOMAN WITHOUT PRIDE

 I'll try to be nice, be nice if I can 
I will try to be nice and please my man 
I'll try to let on that it's a perfect day 
And I'll try to pretend she's going away 
 
I'll try to let on that she never persisted 
I'll try to let on she never was twisted 
I'll try to pretend she doesn't exist 
And I'll try to let on that you never kissed her 
Kissed her, kissed her, kissed her, kissed her, kissed her, kissed her, kissed her 
 
You don't see things like I do

YEATS' GRAVE

 Silenced by death in the grave 
W B Yeats couldn't save 
Why did you stand here 
Were you sickened in time 
But I know by now 
Why did you sit here? 
In the GRAVE 
 
W.B. Yeats Second 
 
Why should I blame her, 
that she filled my days 
With misery or that she would of late 
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways 
Or hurled the little streets upon the grave 
Had they but courage 
Equal to desire 
 
Sad that Maud Gonne couldn't stay 
But she had Mac Bride anyway 
And you sit here with me 
on the isle Inistree 
 
And you are writing down everything 
But I know by now 
Why did you sit here 
In the grave... 
 
Why should I blame her 
Had they but courage equal to desire

YESTERDAY'S GONE

 I heard she loved you 
I heard she cared 
I heard she miscarried 
And you were scared 
 
Did you run, from the one 
who conceived your child 
Yesterday's Gone, there's no return 
And she cries all night 
 
I believe that a woman can be 
A slave to the man 
I believe that love we can make 
And I try if I can 
 
Will you return, to the one 
who conceived your child 
Yesterday's Gone, there's no return 
And she cries all night 
 
Did you run from the one 
who conceived your child 
Yesterday's Gone, there's no return 
And she cries all night

Aahh, you and me it will always be

Dwelling in this happiness, 
your gift of purity 
 
Eh ee oh, eh ee oh,

We must be mistaken 
It's the same old theme since 1916 
In your head, in your head they're still fightin'

In your head, in your head they are dyin'
