 Are you such a dreamer? 
To put the world to rights? 
I'll stay home forever 
Where two & two always 
makes up five 
 
I'll lay down the tracks 
Sandbag & hide 
January has April's showers 
And two & two always 
makes up five 
 
It's the devil's way now 
There is no way out 
You can scream & you 
can shout 
It is too late now 
Because 
 
You have not been 
paying attention 
 
I try to sing along 
I get it all wrong 
Ezeepeezeeeezeepeeezee 
NOT 
I swat em like flies but 
Like flies the burgers 
Keep coming back 
NOT 
Maybe not 
 All hail to the thief 
 But I am not! 
 Don't question my authority 
or put me in the dock 
Cozimnot! 
Go & tell the king that 
The sky is falling in 
When it's not 
Maybe not. 
 
(ahh diddums.)

you had to shred our big day 
you had to ruin it for all concerned 
in a drunken punchup at a wedding.

A REMINDER

 If I get old, I will not give in 
But if I do, remind me of this. 
Remind me that, once I was free, 
Once I was cool, once I was me. 
And if I sat down, and crossed my arms, 
Hold me into, this song. 
Knock me out, smash out my brains, 
If I take a chair, start to talk shit..... 
If I get old, remind me of this: 
That night we kissed, and I really meant it. 
 
Whatever happens, if we're still speaking. 
Pick up the phone, play me this song.

AIRBAG

 In the next world war 
in a jack knifed juggernaut 
I am born again 
In the neon sign scrolling up and down 
I am born again 
 
In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe 
 
In a deep deep sleep of the innocent I am born again 
In a fast german car I'm amazed that I survived 
An airbag saved my life 
 
In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe 
In an interstellar burst I am back to save the universe

 Don't get any big ideas

CLIMBING UP THE WALLS

 I am the key to the lock in your house, 
that keeps your toys in the basement 
And if you get too far inside, 
you'll only see my reflection 
It's always best when the light is off, 
I am the pick in the ice 
Do not cry out or hit the alarm, 
we're friends till we die 
 
And either way you turn, 
I'll be there, open up your skull 
I'll be there, climbing up the walls 
 
It's always best when the light is off, 
it's always better on the outside 
Fifteen blows to the back of my head, 
fifteen blows to your mind 
So tuck the kids in safe tonight, 
shut the eyes in the cupboard 
So not cry out or hit the alarm, 
you'll get the loneliest feeling 
 
That either way you turn, 
I'll be there, open up your skull 
I'll be there, climbing up the walls 
 
Climb up the walls. climb up the walls

The drying of your tears, today we escape, we escape 
Pack and get dressed,

Breathe, keep breathing, 
don't lose your nerve, breathe, keep breathing 
I can't do this alone 
Sing us a song, a song to keep us warm, 
there's such a chill, such a chill 
 
You can laugh a spineless laugh 
We hope your rules and wisdom 
choke you now we are one in everlasting peace 
We hope that you choke, that you choke 
We hope that you choke, that you choke

Too scared to know the reasons why

FITTER HAPPIER

 Fitter, happier, 
more productive, 
comfortable, not drinking too much 
Regular exercise at the gym, 3 days a week 
Getting on better 
with your associate employee contemporaries at ease 
Eating well, 
no more microwave dinners and saturated fats 
A patient better driver, a safer car, 
baby smiling in back seat 
Sleeping well, no bad dreams, no paranoia 
Careful to all animals, 
never washing spiders down the plughole 
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then 
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall 
Favors for favors, fond but not in love 
Charity standing orders 
on sundays ring road supermarket 
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants 
Car wash, also on sundays, 
no longer afraid 
of the dark or midday shadows 
Nothing so ridiculously teenage 
and desperate nothing so childish 
At a better pace, 
slower and more calculated, no chance of escape 
Now self employed, concerned, but powerless 
An empowered and informed member of society, 
pragmatism not idealism 
Will not cry in public, 
less chance of illness, 
tires that grip in the wet 
Shot of baby strapped in back seat, 
a good memory still cries at a good film 
Still kisses with saliva, 
no longer empty and frantic like a cat tied to a stick 
That's driven into frozen winter shit, 
the ability to laugh at weakness 
Calm fitter, healthier 
and more productive a pig in a cage on antibiotics

 Mother mary come to me 
Cause I am a wicked child 
I have sinned and I am so confused and I am a wicked child 
I am a wicked child 
 
I am the devils son and I wish I could be good for you 
I walk a crooked mile 
but I wish I could be good 
I wish I could be good 
 
If I could have kept the straight and narrow 
If I could have kept the straight and narrow 
And not have broke your heart 
Not have broke your heart 
 
Now I wake up in the night 
Lying on my bed 
It's tugging at my arms and legs 
Like I was a marionette 
 
Send baby Jesus 
Surely it is time 
Send baby jesus 
Let him radiate his light

I am the devils son and I wish I could be good for you

I CAN'T

 Please forget the words 
that I just blurted out 
It wasn't me, 
it was a strange and creepy doubt 
 
They keep drivin' in my cage 
There's nothing in this world to keep the time 
 
Even though I might, 
Even though I try, 
I can't 
 
See the things that keep, keep me uninvolved 
Silly words that I, that I can't live without 
 
If you give up on me now, 
I'll be gutted like I've never been before 
 
Even though I might, 
Even though I try, 
I can't 
 
If you give up on me now, 
I'll be gutted like I've never been before 
 
Even though I might, 
Even though I try, 
 
I can't

I MIGHT BE WRONG

 I might be wrong 
I might be wrong 
I could have sworn 
I saw a light coming on 
 
I used to think 
I used to think 
There is no future left at all 
I used to think 
 
Open up, begin again 
Let's go down the waterfall 
Think about the good times 
And never look back 
Never look back 
 
What would I do? 
What would I do? 
If I did not have you? 
 
Open up, let me in 
Let's go down the waterfall 
Have ourselves a good time 
It's nothing at all 
Nothing at all 
Nothing at all

comes like a comet, 
suckered you but not your friends. 
one day he'll get to you, 
teach you how to be a holy cow. 
 
don't get my sympathy hanging out the 15th floor. 
you've changed the locks 3 times, 
he still comes reeling through the door. 
and soon he'll get to you, 
teach you how to get to purest hell. 
 
you do it to yourself you do 
and that's what really hurts is 
you do it to yourself just you, 
you and no one else

What if they don't get outta the way?

Lock me up in the back of the trunk, 
packed with foam and blind drunk. 
 
They won't ever catch me alive, cause they all drive..

LET DOWN

 Transport, motorways and tram lines 
Starting and then stopping, taking off and landing 
The emptiest of feelings disappointed people 
clinging onto bottles and 
When it comes its so so disappointing 
 
Let down and hanging around 
Crushed like a bug in the ground 
Let down and hanging around 
 
Shell smashed, juices flowing wings twitch, 
legs are going 
Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel 
One day I'm going to grow wings 
A chemical reaction, 
hysterical and useless hysterical and 
 
Let down and hanging around 
Crushed like a bug in the ground 
Let down and hanging around let down again 
 
You know, you know where you are with you, 
know where you are 
With floor collapses floating, 
bouncing back and one day 
I am gonna grow wings 
A chemical reaction, 
hysterical and useless hysterical and 
 
Let down and hanging around 
Crushed like a bug in the ground 
Let down and hanging around

MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION

 Was always waiting for the crush 
The car to drive right through the shops 
To call in sick and late at work 
And take a holiday 
 
Was always tangled up in knots 
To keep myself from speaking up 
But no one's listening anyway 
Just trying to bribe me 
 
And if it's alright 
Then what are we doing here? 
And if it's alright 
This place is gassed by fear 
And if it's alright 
I'll tell you cos you never understand 
And if it's alright I'll beg you 
'Cause I'm a begging kind of man 
 
Today I wrote a bad cheque 
Packed a bag and took a jet 
And no one's looking anyway 
I hope you miss me

Washed down the toilet

You'll see devils tearing your life away 
But, if you've made your peace 
Then the devils are really angels 
Freeing you from the Earth... from the Earth 
 
White worms on the underground 
Caught between stations

Who do not want to climb down from 
Their chestnut tree 
Long white gloves 
Police tread carefully 
Escaped from the zoo

THERE THERE

 in pitch dark i go walking in your landscape. 
broken branches trip me as i speak. 
just because you feel it doesnt mean it's there. 
just because you feel it doesnt mean it's there. 
 
there's always a siren 
singing you to shipwreck. 
(don't reach out, don't reach out) 
steer away from these rocks 
we'd be a walking disaster. 
(don't reach out, don't reach out) 
 
just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there. 
(there's someone on your shoulder) 
just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there. 
(there's someone on your shoulder) 
 
there there 
 
why so green and lonely? 
heaven sent you to me. 
 
we are accidents 
waiting waiting to happen.

THINKING ABOUT YOU

 Been thinking about you, 
the way I cut your hair 
Your eyes are on my wall, 
your teeth are over there 
 
But I'm still no one, 
and you're my star 
 
What do you care? 
 
Been thinking about you, 
and there's no rest 
 
Should I still love you, 
still see you in bed 
 
When I'm playing with myself? 
What do you care 
when the other men are far, far better? 
 
All the things you got, 
all the things you need 
I bought you cigarettes, 
and pried the company 
to come and see you, 
honey 
 
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep? 
Those people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet 
They don't know what I know. 
Why should you care when I'm not there? 
 
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest 
Should I still love you, still see you in bed 
When I'm playing with myself? 
What do you care when I'm not there? 
 
All the things you got 
that you'll never need 
all the things you got 
I bled and 
I bleed to please you 
 
Been thinking 
about you...

THIS MESS WE'RE IN

 Can you hear them? 
The helicopters? 
I m in New York 
No need for words now 
We sit in silence 
You look me 
In the eye directly 
You met me 
I think it s Wednesday 
The evening 
The mess we re in and 
 
The city sun sets over me 
 
Night and day 
I dream of 
Making love 
To you now baby 
Love making 
On screen 
Impossible dream 
And I have seen 
The sunrise 
Over the river 
The freeway 
Reminding 
Of this mess we re in and 
 
The city sun sets over me 
 
What were you wanting? 
I just want to say 
Don t ever change now baby 
And thank you 
I don t think we ll ever meet again 
And you must leave now 
Before the sunrise 
Above skyscrapers 
The sin and 
The mess we re in and 
 
The city sun sets over me

For your magazines 
I am trapped in the society page

At the end of the tunnel?

TRUE LOVE WAITS

 i'll drown my beliefs 
to have you be in peace 
i'll dress like your niece 
to wash your swollen feet 
 
just don't leave

and true love waits 
in haunted attics 
and true love wins 
on lollipops and crisps 
 
just don't leave 
don't leave 
 
i'm not living 
i'm just killing time 
your tiny hands 
your crazy kiss and smile 
 
just lonely, longing

UP ON THE LADDER

 monster in the ?????? 
trapped in our birth space 
a man sleep timing 
the mixture of mother craze 
 
all the right moves and in the right percent 
watch my dog, a puppet 
looking as it's seen a strain 
 
give me an answer 
give me a line 
i've been climbing up this high 
i've been wasting my time 
 
climb up the ladder 
up the ladder

climb, climb up the ladder 
up the ladder 
up on the ladder 
it's my time to escape 
 
up on the ladder 
away from your mistake 
 
up on the ladder 
to call out the pain 
 
up on the ladder

VEGETABLE

 I never wanted anything like this 
I worked hard, tried hard 
I ran around in domestic bliss 
I fought hard, died long 
 
Every time you're running out of here 
Every time you're running I get the fear 
 
I never wanted any broken bones 
Scarred face, no home 
Your words surround me and asphyxiate 
And I burn all hate 
 
Every time you're running out on me 
Every time you're running I can see 
 
I'm not a vegetable 
I will not control myself 
I spit on the hand that feeds me 
I will not control myself 
 
The waters spray, the waters roll all over me 
The waters spray, the waters roll on this tired [?] 
 
I'm not a vegetable 
I will not control myself 
I spit on the hand that feeds me 
I will not control myself

WE SUCK YOUNG BLOOD

 are you hungry? 
are you sick? 
are you begging for a break? 
 
are you sweet? 
are you fresh? 
are you strung up by the wrists? 
 
we want the young blood 
 
are you fracturing? 
are you torn at the seams? 
would you do anything? 
flea bitten? motheaten? 
 
we suck young blood 
we suck young blood 
 
won't let the creeping ivy 
won't let the nervous bury me 
our veins are thin 
our rivers poisoned 
 
we want the sweet meats 
we want the young blood

i am up in the clouds

and i can't and i can't come down 
 
i can watch but not take part 
where i end and where you start 
where you, you left me alone 
you left me alone.

Sprawling on a pin, 
Hanging off the hook,

We know what you want, 
We know what you want, 
What you really wanted. 
 
Take a look around, 
There's candles on the cake,

The road you should have took, 
Mistakes mistaken 
 
There's no use dwelling on, 
No use dwelling on.
