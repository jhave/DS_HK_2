A DAY IN THE LIFE

 I read the news today oh boy 
About a lucky man who made the grade 
And though the news was rather sad 
Well I just had to laugh 
I saw the photograph 
He blew his mind out in a car 
He didn't notice that the lights had changed 
A crowd of people stood and stared 
They'd seen his face before 
Nobody was really sure 
If he was from the House of Lords 
I saw a film today oh boy 
The English Army had just won the war 
A crowd of people turned away 
but I just had to look 
Having read the book 
I'd love to turn you on  

Woke up, fell out of bed 
Dragged a comb across my head 
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup 
And looking up I noticed I was late 
Found my coat and grabbed my hat 
Made the bus in seconds flat 
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke 
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream 

I read the news today oh boy 
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire 
And though the holes were rather small 
They had to count them all 
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall 
I'd love to turn you on

A HARD DAY S NIGHT

 It's been a hard day's night, 
And I've been working like a dog, 
It's been a hard day's night, 
I should be sleeping like a lo 
but when I get home to you 
I'll find the things that you do 
will make me feel alright 
You know I work all day 
to get you money, 
to buy you things 
And it's worth it just to hear you say, 
you're gonna give me everything 
That's why I like to come home 
'cause when I get you alone 
you know I feel allright 
When I'm home, 
everything seems to be right 
When I'm home, 
feeling you holding me tight, tight 
That's why I like to come home, 'cause when I get you alone 
you know I feel allright 
you know I feel alright 
you know I feel alright 


 

BEATLES (THE)
A TASTE OF HONEY

 A taste of honey. 
Tasting much sweeter than wine. 
I dream of your first kiss and then, 
I feel upon my lips again, 
A taste of honey. 
Tasting much sweeter than wine. 
I will return, 
yes I will return, 
I'll come back 
for the honey, 
and you. 
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart, 
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart, 
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine. 
I will return, yes I will return, 
I'll come back 
for the honey, 
and you.

ACROSS THE UNIVERSE

 Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup, 
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe 
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, 
Possessing and caressing me. 
Jai guru de va om 
Nothing's gonna change my world, 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
 
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes, 
That call me on and on across the universe, 
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they 
Tumble blindly as they make their way 
Across the universe 
Jai guru de va om 
Nothing's gonna change my world, 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
 
Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing 
Through my open views inviting and inciting me 
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a 
million suns, it calls me on and on 
Across the universe 
Jai guru de va om 
Nothing's gonna change my world, 
Nothing's gonna change my world.

FOR NO ONE

 Your day breaks, your mind aches 
You find that all the words of kindness linger on 
When she no longer needs you 
She wakes up, she makes up 
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry 
She no longer needs you 
And in her eyes you see nothing 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one 
A love that should have lasted years 
You want her, you need her 
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead 
You think she needs you 
And in her eyes you see nothing 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one 
A love that should have lasted years 
You stay home, she goes out 
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone 
She doesn't need him 
Your day breaks, your mind aches 
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head 
you won't forget her 
And in her eyes you see nothing 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one 
A love that should have lasted years

HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE

 To lead a better life 
I need my love to be here 
Here,making each day of the year 
Changing my life with wave of her hand 
Nobody can deny that there's something there. 
There,running my hands through her hair 
Both of us thinking how good it can be 
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there. 
I want her everywhere 
And if she's beside me i know i need never care 
But to love her is to meet her everywhere 
Knowing that love is to share 
Each one believing that love never dies 
Watching her eyes and hoping i'm always there. 
I want her everywhere 
And if she's beside me i know i need never care 
But to love her is to meet her everywhere 
Knowing that love is to share 
Each one believing that love never dies 
Watching her eyes and hoping i'm always there. 
To be there and everywhere 
here,there,and everywhere.

HEY BULLDOG

 Sheepdog 
Standing in the rain, 
Bullfrog 
Doing it again 
Some think that happinness is measured out in years 
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears 
Child like 
No one understands, 
Jack knife 
In your sweaty hands, 
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles 
What makes you think you're something special when you smile 
You can talk to me, if you're lonely you can talk to me 
Big man 
Walking in the park 
Whigwam 
Frightened of the dark 
Some think that happiness is measured out in you 
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue 
You can talk to me, if you're lonely you can talk to me

Corporation tee shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday. 
Man, you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long. 
I am the eggman, they are the eggmen. 
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob. 
Mister City Policeman sitting 
Pretty little policemen in a row. 
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run.

'cause I've just lost the only girl I had. 
If I could get my way, 
I'd get myself locked up today, 
but I can't, 
so I'll cry instead. 
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet, 
I can't talk to people that I meet. 
If I could see you now, 
I'd try to make you sad somehow, 
but I can't, 
so I'll cry instead. 
Don't want to cry when there's people there, 
I get shy when they start to stare, 
I'm gonna hide myself away, 
but I'll come back again someday. 
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls, 
'cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world. 
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two, 
I'll show you what your loving man can do. 
Until then I'll cry instead.

 I'm a Loser, I'm a Loser,

She was a girl in a million my friend, 
I should have known she would win in the end. 
I'm a Loser, I'm a Loser, 
and I lost someone who's near to me. 
I'm a Loser, I'm a Loser, 
and I'm not what I appear to be. 
Although I act and I laugh like a clown, 
beneath this mask I am wearing a frown. 
My tears are falling like rain from the sky, 
is it for her or myself that I cry? 
I'm a Loser, I'm a Loser, 
and I lost someone who's near to me. 
I'm a Loser, I'm a Loser, 
and I'm not what I appear to be. 
What have I done to deserve such a fate? 
I realise I have left it too late. 
And so it's true pride comes before a fall, 
I'm telling you so that you won't loose all. 
I'm a Loser, I'm a Loser, 
and I lost someone who's near to me. 
I'm a Loser, I'm a Loser,

You don't sound different, 
I've learnt the game. 
I'm looking through you, 
you're not the same. 
Why, tell me why

You're thinking of me,

You were above me,

The only difference, 
is you're down there.

IF I FELL

 If I fell in love with you 
would you promise to be true 
and help me understand? 
'Cause I've been in love before 
and I found that love was more 
than just holding hands 
If I give my heart to you, 
I must be sure 
from the very start 
that you, 
would love me more than her 
If I trust in you oh please, 
don't run and hide 
If I love you too oh please 
don't hurt my pride like her, 
'cause I couldn't stand the pain 
and I, 
would be sad if our new love, 
was in vain 
So I hope you see that I, 
would love to love you, 
and that she will cry 
when she learns we are two.

 There are places I'll remember all my life, 
though some have changed. 
Some forever not for better 
some have gone and some remain. 
All these places have their moments 
with lovers and friends I still can recall. 
Some are dead and some are living, 
in my life I've loved them all 
But of all these friends and lovers 
there is no one compares with you. 
And these memories lose their meaning 
when I think of love as something new. 
Though I know I'll never lose affection 
for people and things that went before 
I know I'll often stop and think about them 
in my life I love you more.

Why should I feel the way I do? 
It's only love, and that is all, 
but it's so hard loving you. 
Is it right that you and I should fight 
every night? 
Just the sight of you makes nightime bright, 
very bright. 
Haven't I the right to make it up girl? 
It's only love and that is all, 
Why should I feel the way I do? 
It's only love, and that is all

And the more I go inside, the more there is to see 
It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere, it's what you make 
For us to take, it's all too much 
Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me 
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be 
It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around here 
All the world's a birthday cake, 
So take a piece but not too much 
 
Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free 
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea 
It's all to much for me to see 
A love that's shining all around here 
The more I am, the less I know 
And what I do is all too much 
It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere, it's what you make 
For us to take, it's all too much 
It's too much.....It's too much 
Too much too much too much

LET IT BE

 When I find myself in times of trouble 
Mother Mary comes to me 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
And in my hour of darkness 
She is standing right in front of me 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. 
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. 
 
And when the broken hearted people 
Living in the world agree, 
There will be an answer, let it be. 
For though they may be parted there is 
Still a chance that they will see 
There will be an answer, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. Yeah 
There will be an answer, let it be. 
 
And when the night is cloudy, 
There is still a light that shines on me, 
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be. 
I wake up to the sound of music

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. 
There will be an answer, let it be.

LOVELY RITA

 Lovely Rita meter maid, lovely Rita meter maid 
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, nothing can come between us 
when it gets dark I tow your heart away 
Standing by a parking meter when I caught a glimpse of Rita 
Filling in the ticket in her little white book. 
 
I the cap she looked much older 
And the bag across her shoulder 
made her look a little like a military man. 
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, may I inquire discreetly, 
When you are free to take some tea with me 
 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner 
Told her I would really like to see her again 
 
Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home and nearly made it 
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two. 
 
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid, where would I be without you, 
Give us a wink and make me think of you

LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS

 Picture yourself in a boat on a river 
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies. 
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, 
A girl with caleidoscope eyes. 
 
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green 
Towering over your head. 
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes 
And she's gone. 
 
Chorus: 
Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah 
 
Follow her downto a bridge by the fountain 
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies. 
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers 
That grow so incredibly high. 
 
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore 
Waiting to take you away 
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone. 
 
Chorus 
 
Picture yourself on a train in a station 
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, 
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile, 
The girl with caleidoscope eyes. 
 
Chorus

And she never walk down Lime Street any more

They returned me to 
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER

 Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical 
Science in the home 
Late nights all alone with a test tube 
Ohh oh oh oh... 
 
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone 
 Can I take you out to the pictures Joan? 
 
But as she's getting ready to go 
A knock comes on the door... 
 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Came down upon her head 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Made sure that she was dead 
 
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again 
Teacher gets annoyed 
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene 
 
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
So he waits behind 
Writing 50 times I must not be so... 
 
But when she turns her back on the boy 
He creeps up from behind 
 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Came down upon her head 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Made sure that she was dead 
 
B.C. Thirty One said we caught a dirty one 
Maxwell stands alone 
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh 
 
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery 
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free) 
The judge does not agree and he tells them so 
 
But as the words are leaving his lips 
A noise comes from behind 
 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Came down upon his head 
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Made sure that he was dead

MEAN MR. MUSTARD

 Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park 
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper 
Sleeps in a hole in the road 
Saving up to buy some clothes 
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose 
Such a mean old man 
Such a mean old man 
 
His sister Pam works in a shop 
She never stops, she's a go getter 
Takes him out to look at the queen 
Only place that he's ever been 
Always shouts out something obscene 
Such a dirty old man 
Dirty old man

It's gonna be a drag in misery.

Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one. 
Send her back to me, 
'Cause everyone can see 
Without her I will be in misery

NORWEGIAN WOOD

 I once had a girl, 
or should I say she once had me? 
She showed me her room, 
isn't it good, Norwegian wood? 
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere, 
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair. 
I sat on a rug, 
biding my time, drinking her wine. 
We talked until two 
and then she said It's time for bed . 
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh. 
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath. 
And when I awoke 
I was alone, this bird had flown. 
So I lit a fire, 
isn't it good, Norwegian wood?

 I'd like to be under the sea 
In an octopus' garden in the shade 
He'd let us in, knows where we've been 
In his octopus' garden in the shade 
 
I'd ask my friends to come and see 
An octopus' garden with me 
I'd like to be under the sea 
In an octopus' garden in the shade. 
 
We would be warm below the storm 
In our little hideaway beneath the waves 
Resting our head on the sea bed 
In an octopus' garden near a cave 
 
We would sing and dance around 
because we know we can't be found 
I'd like to be under the sea 
In an octopus' garden in the shade 
 
We would shout and swim about 
The coral that lies beneath the waves 
(Lies beneath the ocean waves) 
Oh what joy for every girl and boy 
Knowing they're happy and they're safe 
(Happy and they're safe) 
 
We would be so happy you and me 
No one there to tell us what to do 
I'd like to be under the sea 
In an octopus' garden with you.

ONLY A NORTHERN SONG

 If you're listening to this song 
You may think the chords are going wrong 
But they're not 
He just wrote it like that. 
It doesn't really matter what chords I play 
What words I say 
or time of day it is 
As it's only a Northern song 
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear 
Or how I fare 
or if my hair is brown 
When it's only a Northern song. 
When you're listening late at night 
You may think the band are not quite right 
But they are, they just play it like that 
It doesn't really matter what chords I play 
What words I say or time of day it is 
As it's only a Northern song. 
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear 
Or how I fare 
or if my hair is brown 
When it's only a Northern song. 
If you think the harmony 
Is a little dark and out of key 
You're correct, there's nobody there. 
It doesn't really matter what chords I play 
What words I say or time of day it is 
And I told you there's no one there

PENNY LANE

 In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs 
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know. 
And all the people that come and go 
Stop and say hello. 
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, 
The little children laugh at him behind his back. 
And the banker never wears a mack 
In the pouring rain, very strange. 
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
There beneath the blue suburban skies 
I sit, and meanwhile back 
In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass 
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. 
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, 
It's a clean machine. 
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
A four of fish and finger pies 
In summer, meanwhile back 
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout 
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray 
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play 
She is anyway. 
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, 
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim. 
And then the fireman rushes in 
From the pouring rain, very strange. 
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
There beneath the blue suburban skies 
I sit, and meanwhile back. 
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
There beneath the blue suburban skies, 
Penny Lane.

ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC

 Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music 
Any old way you choose it 
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me 
I've got no kick against modern jazz 
Unless they try to play it too darn fast 
And lose the beauty of the melody 
Until they sound just like a symphony 
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music 
Any old way you choose it 
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me 
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks 
So she can hear my man awail a sax 
I must admit they have a rockin' band 
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican' 
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music 
Any old way you choose it 
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me 
Way down South they had a jubilee 
The jokey folks they had a jamboree 
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup 
The folks dancin' there are all shook up 
And started playin' that that rock and roll music 
Any old time you use it 
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me 
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango 
And In The Mood they take a mambo 
It's way to early for a congo 
So keep a rockin' that piano 
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music 
Any old time you use it 
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me

It's a rockin' rhythm record 
I want my jockey to play. 
Roll Over Beethoven,

Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tchaikowsky the news. 
I got the rockin' pneumonia, 
I need a shot of rhythm and blues. 
I think I'm rollin' arthritis

Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two. 
Well, if you feel you like it, 
go get your lover, then reel and rock it. 
Roll it over and move on up just

SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW

 She came in through the bathroom window 
Protected by a silver spoon 
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders 
By the banks of her own lagoon 
 
Didn't anybody tell her? 
Didn't anybody see? 
Sunday's on the phone to Monday, 
Tuesday's on the phone to me 
 
She said she'd always been a dancer 
She worked at 15 clubs a day 
And though she thought I knew the answer 
Well I knew what I could not say. 
 
And so I quit the police department 
And got myself a steady job 
And though she tried her best to help me 
She could steal but she could not rob 
 
Didn't anybody tell her? 
Didn't anybody see? 
Sunday's on the phone to Monday, 
Tuesday's on the phone to me 
Oh yeah.

SHE IS LEAVING HOME

 Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins 
Silently closing her bedroom door 
Leaving the note that she hope would say more 
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief 
Quietly turning the backdoor key 
Stepping outside she is free 
 
She (We gave her most of our lives) 
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives) 
Home (We gave her everything money could buy) 
She's leaving home after living alone for so many years. Bye, bye 
 
Father snores as his wife gets into the dressing gown 
Picks up the leter that's lying there 
Standing alone at the top of the stairs 
She breaks down and cries to her husband 
Daddy, our baby's gone 
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly 
How could she do this to me 
 
She (We never thought of ourselves) 
is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves) 
home (We gave her everything money could buy) 
She's leaving home after living alone for so many years. Bye, bye 
 
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away 
Waiting to keep the appointment she made 
Meeting a man from a motor trade 
 
She (What did we do that was wrong) 
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong) 
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy) 
 
Something inside that was always denied for so many years 
She's leaving home, bye, bye. 


 

SHE SAID SHE SAID

 She Said She Said She said I know what it's like to be dead 
I know what it is to be sad 
And she's making me feel like I've never been born. 
I said Who put all those things in your hair 
Things that ake me feel that I'm mad 
And you're making me feel like I've never been born. 
She said you don't understand what I said 
I said No, no, no, you're wrong 
When I was a boy everything was right 
Everything was right 
I said Even though you know what you know 
I know that I'm ready to leave 
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born 
She said you don't understand what I said 
I said No, no, no, you're wrong 
When I was a boy everything was right 
Everything was right 
I said Even though you know what you know 
I know that I'm ready to leave 
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born

 

SOMETHING

 Something in the way she moves 
Attracts me like no other lover 
Something in the way she woos me 
 
I don't want to leave her now 
You know I believe her now 
 
Somewhere in her smile she knows 
That I don't need no other lover 
Something in her style that shows me 
 
Don't want to leave her now 
You know I believe her now 
 
You're asking me will my love grow 
I don't know, I don't know 
You stick around now it may show 
I don't know, I don't know 
 
Something in the way she knows 
And all I have to do is think of her 
Something in the things she shows me 
 
Don't want to leave her now 
You know I believe her now

 Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields. 
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.

It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesn't matter 
much to me.

Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.

 Day after day alone on the hill, 
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still, 
But nobody wants to know him, 
They can see that he's just a fool, 
And he never gives an answer, 
But the fool on the hill 
Sees the sun going down, 
And the eyes in his head, 
See the world spinning around. 
Well on his way his head in a cloud, 
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud 
But nobody ever hears him, 
Or the sound he appears to make, 
And he never seems to notice, 
But the fool on the hill... 
Nobody seems to like him 
They can tell what he wants to do. 
And he never shows his feelings, 
But the fool on the hill...

These days such a kind girl, 
seem so hard to find. 
Someday when we're dreaming, 
deep in love, not a lot to say, 
then we will remember 
things we said today. 
Me, I'm just the lucky kind, 
love to hear you say that love is luck. 
And though we may be blind, 
love is here to stay, and that's enough 
to make you mine, girl, 
be the only one. 
Love me all the time, girl, 
we'll go on and on.

THINK FOR YOURSELF

 I've got a word or two 
to say about the things that you do. 
You're telling all those lies 
about the good things that we can have 
if we close our eyes. 
Do what you want to do, 
and go where you're going to, 
think for yourself 
'cos I won't be there with you. 
I left you far behind 
the riuns of the life that you had in mind. 
And though you still can see, 
I know your mind's made up 
you're gonna cause more misery. 
Do what you want to do, 
and go where you're going to, 
think for yourself 
'cos I won't be there with you. 
Although your mind's opaque 
try thinking more if just for your own shake. 
The future still looks good,

all the things that you should.

think for yourself 
'cos I won't be there with you

I don't know why she's riding so high, 
She ought to think twice,

Before she gets to saying goodbye, 
She ought to think twice, 
She ought to do right by me. 
I think I'm gonna be sad, 
I think it's today yeah.

TILL THERE WAS YOU

 There were bells on a hill, 
But I never heard them ringing. 
No I never heard them at all 
Till there was you. 
There were birds in the sky, 
But I never saw them winging. 
No I never saw them at all 
Till there was you. 
Then there was music, and wonderful roses 
They tell me, 
in sweet fragrant meadows 
of dawn, 
and you. 
There was love all around, 
But I never heard it singing. 
No I never heard it at all 
Till there was you. 


 

BEATLES (THE)
TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS

 Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream, 
It is not dying, it is not dying 
Lay down al thoughts, surrender to the void, 
It is shining, it is shining. 
Yet you may see the meaning of within 
It is being, it is being 
Love is all and love is everyone 
It is knowing, it is knowing 
And ignorance and hate mourn the dead 
It is believing, it is believing 
But listen to the colour of your dreams 
It is not leaving, it is not leaving 
So play the game Existence to the end 
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Wait

But if your heart breaks, 
don't wait, 
turn me away. 
And if your heart's strong, 
hold on, 
I won't delay. 
Wait

but when I saw him with you I could feel my future fold. 
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie, 
tell me why. 
What goes on in your heart?

You're tearing me apart,

What goes on in your mind? 
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time,

It's so easy for a girl like you to lie, 
tell me why. 
What goes on in your heart? 
I used to think of no one else, but you were just the same 
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name. 
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die? 
Tell me why.

 When I get older losing my hair, 
Many years from now

Birthday greetings, bottle of wine

Wold you lock the door 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me 
When I'm sixty four. 
 
You'll be older too, 
And if you say the word I could stay with you. 
 
I could be handy mending a fuse 
When your lights have gone 
You can knit a sweater by the fireside 
Sunday morning go for a ride 
 
Doing a garden, digging the weeds, 
Who could ask for more 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me 
When I'm sixty four. 
 
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight, 
if it's not too dear 
We shall scrimp and save 
Grandchildren on your knee 
Vera, Chuck & Dave 
 
Send me a postcard, drop me a line 
Stating point of view 
Indicater precisely what you mean to say 
Yours sincerely, wasting away 
 
Give me your answer, fill in a form, 
Mine for evermore, 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me 
When I'm sixty four 


 

WITH A LITTLE HELP FOM MY FRIENDS

 What would you think if I sang out of tune, 
Would you stand up and walk out on me ? 
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song 
And I'll try not to sing out of key. 
 
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends 
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends 
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends 
 
What do I do when my love is away 
(Does it worry you to be alone ?) 
How do I feel by the end of the day, 
(Are you sad because you're on your own ?) 
 
No, I get by with a little help from my friends 
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends 
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends 
 
Do you need anybody 
I need somebody to love 
Could it be anybody 
I want somebody to love. 
 
Would you believe in a love at first sight 
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time 
What do you see when you turn out the light 
I can't tell you but I know it's mine, 
 
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends 
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends 
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends 
 
Do you need anybody 
I just need someone to love 
Could it be anybody 
I want somebody to love. 
 
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends

WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU

 We were talking about the space between us all 
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion 
Never glimpse the truth then it's far too late when they pass away 
 
We were talking about the love we all could share 
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love 
With our love we could save the world if they only knew 
 
Try to realise it's all within yourself no one else can make you change 
And to see you're really only very small 
And life flows on within you and without you. 
 
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold 
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul 
They don't know, they can't see are you one of them ? 
 
When you've seen beyond yourself 
then you may find peace of mind is waiting there 
And the time will come when you see we're all one 
And life flows on within you and without you.

There's a shadow hanging over me. 
Oh yesterday came suddenly. 
Why she had to go? 
I don't know she woldn't say.
