 When I was a boy I thought about the times I'd be a man 
I'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in a can 
In my lonely room I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone 
You can throw me if you wanna 'cause I'm a bone and I go 
Oop ip ip oop ip ip, yeah! 
 
If I don't start cryin' it's because that I have got no eyes 
My father's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized 
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way 
Trapped inside a night but I'm a day and I go 
Oop ip ip oop ip ip, yeah!

Me crazy. It's just like being in the navy. 
 
Doomsday, doomsda's coming 1981. 
But until things blow. I'm gonna have 
Some fun. The bubble's going to explode. 
Probably never live to get old. 
 
But I just wanna have some fun. Probably 
Won't see no money. I just wanna have some fun. 
Before they throw me in the sanitarium.

BLANK GENERATION

 I was sayin' let me outta here before I was even born 
It's such a gamble when you get a face 
It's fascinatin' to observe what the mirror does 
But when I done it's for the wall that I set a place 
 
I belong to the blank generation 
And I can take it or leave it each time 
Well, I belong to the generation 
But I can take it or leave it each time 
 
Triangles were fallin' at the window as the doctor cursed 
He was a cartoon long forsaken by the public eye 
The nurse adjusted her garters as I breathed my first 
The doctor grabbed my throat and yelled: God's consolation prize! 
 
(Chorus) 
 
Ooh, ooh, ... 
 
To hold the TV to my lips the air so packed with cash 
Then carry it up flights of stairs and drop it in the vacant lot 
To lose my train of thought and fall into your arms tracks 
And watch beneath the eyelids every passing dot

Drank in all the bars in town for an extended foreign policy 
Pick up the pieces 
 
My brain is hanging upside down I need something to slow me down 
 
My brain is hanging upside down I need something to slow me down 
 
Shouldn't wish you happiness, wish her the very best Fifty thousand dollar dress 
Shaking hands with your highness See through you like cellophane

You looked the other way, the day that I was broke. 
You said I was a joke, you kicked me in the head. 
Then you threw me outta bed.

Boomerang all the things you do, everything you say comes back to you. 
Boomerang, all the things you do. 
Everything you say comes back to you boomerang. 
 
I ended up in jail, you wouldn't pay the bail. 
I bit down all my nails. Remember what it could've been. 
And now I'm on the street, got blisters on my feet. Got bugs in my hair. All because you didn't care.

You played me for a fool, you acted oh so cruel. 
A puppet of a string, I gave you everything. 
But things didn't turn out right. You'd go and start the fight. 
You really screwed my mind. You wasted all my time. (Chorus)

BORN TO DIE IN BERLIN

 Intoxicated by the orchids abandoned in the garden Demanding morphine 
Curse my soul is burning Stranded in the sweet wonderings breathing the 
Pale moon silver Torn painted lips tasting the last drops of life 
 
Sometimes I feel like screaming Sometimes I feel I just can't win 
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind Maybe 
I was born to die in Berlin 
 
I sprinkled cocaine on the floor when no one was watching I closed 
My eyes and I let myself sleep Creeps and dirty bastards, demons waitin' 
by my bed There's no choice or difference, no one seems to notice 
 
Sometimes I feel like screamin' Sometimes I feel I just can't win 
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind 
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin 
 
(Third verse in German) 
 
Sometimes I feel like screamin' Sometimes I feel I just can't win

JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE MIND

 Leave your cares behind 
Come with us and find 
The pleasures of a journey to the center of the mind 
 
Come along if you care 
Come along if you dare 
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind 
 
Beyond the seas of thought 
Beyone the realm of what 
Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not 
 
Come along if you care 
Come along if you dare 
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind 
 
But please realise 
You'll probably be surprised 
For it's the land unknown to man 
Where fantasy is fact 
So if you can, please understand 
You might not come back 
Come along if you care 
Come along if you dare 
Take a ride to the land inside and you'll see 
How happy life could be 
If all of mankind 
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind 
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind

Like Romeo and Juliet You two made a pact of death 
Like the needle that ya used Sid and Nancy were born to lose 
Love kills Love kills Love kills 
 
Sid never meant any harm He shot some dope into his arm

MAIN MAN

 When i start movin', you see a blur. 
Get hooked on me baby, there ain't no cure. 
I've always been able to laugh at fate. 
Two brown eyes filled with hate. 
 
I'm the man who makes the street his home 
And my lean mean hearts is just as hard as stone. 
 
Oh, I'm my main man. 
Don't want nothing from no one. 
I'm my main man. 
Always ready for what ever's gonna happen. 
 
Spend my time in a cold jail cell, shootin' up poison 
And livin' in hell and I never care what people think, 
My history's written on me in tattooed ink. 
And still life goes on tracks on my arms, 
And the number thirteen is my good luck charm. 
 
Oh, I'm my main man. 
Don't want nothing from no one. 
I'm my main man. 
Always ready for what ever's gonna happen. 
 
What happens to me is my own affair. 
If you don't like me, I really don't care. 
'Cause no one's been what I've been through, 
And I don't do what people want me to do. 
I'll fight you till the bitter end, 
And then I'll screw your little girl friend. 
 
Oh, I'm my main man. 
Don't want nothing from no one. 
I'm my main man. 
Always ready for what ever's gonna happen

Fast, like a loopty loop Then around, like a merry go round 
 
We even at a hot dog stand Slam danced to a rockin' band 
And when she winked, I gave that girl a hug In the tunnel of love 
 
You'll never know how good it just can feel 'Til it stops at the top of the ferris wheel

If I was stupid or naive Trying to achieve what they all call contentness 
If people weren't such dicks and I never made mistakes Then I could find forgiveness 
 
Take my hand Please help me man 'Cause I'm looking for something to believe in 
And I don't know where to start And I don't know where to begin, oh no 
 
I can't be someone else I don't feel that it's hopeless I don't feel that I'm useless 
 
I can't throw it all away I need some courage to find my weakness 
And with your love, I know with all my heart I can win

Is the institution 'cause you're so lazy 
 
You sound like you're sick you look like you're 
Sick too you sound like you're sick 
 
But if you must act up But if you must act up 
You sound like you're sick You sound like you're sick 
 
Well I can't understand anything about you (repeat verse) 
 
You sound like you're sick you look like you're 
Sick too you sound like you're sick 
 
You sound like you're sick you look like you're 
Sick too well you sound like you're sick 
You sound like you're sick

YOU'RE GONNA KILL THAT GIRL

 I saw her walking down the street he jumped down, 
he knocked her off her feet and then I knew it was the end of her 
 
He's gonna kill that girl He's gonna kill that girl 
He's gonna kill that girl tonight 
 
When I saw her walking down the street my heart stood still and skipped 
A beat then he knocked her on the floor but he wanted just a little bit more 
 
He's gonna kill that girl He's gonna kill that girl 
He's gonna kill that girl tonight 
 
When I saw her walking down the street my heart stood still and skipped 
A beat then he knocked her on the floor but he wanted just a little bit more 
 
I saw her lying on the street he jumped down, he knocked 
her off her feet that's when I knew it was the end of her 
 
He's gonna kill that girl He's gonna kill that girl 
He's gonna kill that girl tonight 
 
When I saw her walking down the street my heart stood still and skipped 
A beat then he knocked her on the floor but he wanted just a little bit more

ZERO ZERO UFO

 It landed in a field in Idaho Where it came from, I don't know 
It did not look like it came from Japan And out of the dark walked a strange man 
 
If you think it's a pack of lies, I saw it happen with my own eyes 
A million miles from the milky way A hundred years, a month, and a day 
 
Zero Zero UFO Zero Zero UFO 
 
(When media writes) the neon lights Spaceship travels at the speed of light 
A million stars in the sky I here the Queen's on the alien's side 
 
If you think it's a pack of lies, I saw it happen with my own eyes 
A million miles from the milky way A hundred years, a month, and a day 
Hey 
 
Zero Zero UFO Zero Zero UFO 
Zero Zero UFO Zero Zero UFO Hey
