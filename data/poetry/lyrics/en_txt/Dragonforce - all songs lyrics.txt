BLACK FIRE

 We come from... 
Over the dark horizon sky 
With twisted tales of sacrifice 
To imagine or believe all the glory of the free 
 
Hunting all day an endless cry 
The things I've seen I can't deny 
Sinners, saints all mixed in one 
The dawn of time has begun 
 
Why can't you see what they're doing to me 
Is it fair that I'm dying in vain 
 
Once in a land of sacrifice now only valleys of demise 
Shadows of a pale blue moonlight ride the waves of entity 
 
Why can't you see what they're doing to thee 
Is it fair that you all die in vain 
 
Ride with the steel and the power of the sword 
Stand up and fight now and forever more 
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire 
To be free there must be black fire 
 
Through the day and through the night with dragons heart the warrior strikes 
This is the day that they'll be known as my enemy 
 
Why can't you see what they're doing 
To what we believe in we rise through the pain 
 
Ride with the steel and the power of the sword 
Stand up and fight now and forever more 
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire 
To be free there must be black fire 
 
We come from distant lands we travel so far 
Can you see the bleeding scar 
The prizes of life we fail to win 
Cause we doubt the power within 
 
Why can't you see what they're doing to 
What we believe in we rise through the pain 
 
Ride with the steel and the power of the sword 
Stand up and fight now and forever more 
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire 
To be free there must be black fire 
 
Black fire...

BLACK WINTER NIGHT

 Day after day as I bodies slay 
And the sun becomes dark in the sky 
Everything's lost for this human race 
And the dawn of a new age will rise 
 
Rays of sunlight now are gone 
Only visions of ice will remain 
The fallen ones and forgotten souls 
Will rise up over the slain 
 
No more hope as we raise our hands to the sky 
No more dreams as the rivers run dry 
 
Everything's lost all is left astray 
Only sorrow and sadness remains 
Curtains have dropped on our fallen world 
And the forces of darkness shall rise 
 
Why can't you see what has happened to thee 
Can you not open your eyes 
Everything's lost there is no retreat 
And the valleys echo with pain 
 
No more hope as we raise our hands to the sky 
No more dreams as the rivers run dry 
 
On the endless sea of madness we sail forever more 
And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores 
When the flame has died forever we stand one and all 
With the power of the almighty sword 
 
We fight the battle on the fields tonight 
To save us from the master of all evil sign 
And to the battle on forever standing strong 
We feel the fire power of the night warriors 
 
No more tomorrow 
Dying of sorrow 
Over the mountains and up through the trees 
Traveling across seven seas 
 
No more hope as we hold our hands to the sky 
No more dreams as the rivers run dry 
 
On the endless seas of madness we sail forever more 
And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores 
When the flame has died forever we stand one and all 
With the power of the almighty sword 
 
We fight the battle on the fields tonight 
To save us from the master of all evil sign 
And to the battle on forever standing strong 
We feel the fire power of the night warriors 
 
On the endless seas of madness we sail forever more 
And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores 
When the flame has died forever we stand one and all 
With the power of the almighty sword 
 
We'll fight the battle on the fields tonight 
To save us from the master of all 
We fight the battle on the fields tonight 
To save us from the master of all evil sign 
 
And to the battle on 
Forever standing strong 
We feel the fire 
Power of the night warriors 
 
The power of the night warriors...

 Can you imagine that it's all up to you 
Evil embrace of powers unnatural 
You're left in silence nothing more to behold

 We will sail on 
Forever on to the land of the evening star 
 
Into the endless we ride unveil the darkness behind 
Abandoned glory hidden castaway we ride 
Now will the sky surrender forever through the never 
A silent whisper echoes through my restless heart tonight 
 
I will see the glory rise 
We'll be one tonight 
Don't you shut your eyes in silence 
Tonight gather near, come and live your fear 
 
In a land of desire your heart filled with fire 
You live for the right to be free 
 
We will sail on 
Forever on to the land of the evening star 
In a land of desire your heart filled with fire 
The land of the evening star 
 
Now and forever after 
Asylums filled with laughter 
Suspicion haunts my dreams 
An echo through my mind 
 
This starlit gaze reminds me 
Are you so blind you can't see 
The winds of change my friend 
Will blow for you in the dead night 
 
I will see glory rise 
We'll be one tonight 
Don't you shut your eyes in silence 
Tonight gather near, come and live your fear 
 
In a land of desire your heart filled with fire 
You live for the right to be free

HEART OF THE DRAGON

 Proud and so glorious standing before of us 
Our swords will shine bright in the sky 
When united we come to the land of the sun 
With the heart of a dragon we ride 
 
We are flying on wings in winter sky with fire burning deep inside 
We are warriors of endless time forever and on 
On wings of steel an ancient flight we see the powers that unite 
The gods will now send us a sign of battle once more 
 
Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar 
Where the fights will be raging for now and for more 
When united we come and divided they fall 
Tonight you will witness it all 
 
Proud and so glorious standing before of us 
Our swords will shine bright in the sky 
When united we come to the land of the sun 
With the heart of a dragon we ride 
 
A land unknown we come so far 
We ride the night till morning star 
When colours fade to black and white 
Your eyes come to sight 
 
With the vision of a great divide 
You turn towards the other side 
You think you run but you can't hide 
The dead can not ride 
 
Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar 
Where the fights will be raging for now and for more 
When united we come and divided they fall 
Tonight you will witness it all 
 
Proud and so glorious standing before of us 
Our swords will shine bright in the sky 
When united we come to the land of the sun 
With the heart of a dragon we ride 
 
Over high seas and mountains 
We fly to the heavens on wings of a dragon tonight 
 
Proud and so glorious standing before of us 
Our swords will shine bright in the sky 
 
Proud and so glorious standing before of us

When united we come to the land of the sun

 Coming down the mountain on high 
Towards the battle we go side by side 
Our hearts are filled with honour and pride 
Cause we know our time has come 
 
Silent voices down from below 
Rising up through the ice and the snow 
Ancient angers cast upon all 
Through the land of the slain 
 
Through the dark night through the rain 
Fighting machine we are risen again 
Striving forever more 
We will survive 
 
Stand and fight join the light 
Into the battle with power and might 
Sound the guns 
Raise the cannons of war 
 
With the north star to guide us we ride on the sky 
Blazing up through the heavens like eagles we fly 
And the horsemen shall come they will judge all your lives 
Revelations will now be unveiled 
 
Darkened night set to swallow the light 
All is lost there's no one left to fight 
Overpowered by the glory and might 
Of the ones who stand tall 
 
Fallen heroes scattered around 
Deafened ears opens up to the sound 
Painful cries rising forever more 
Through the victims of life and of war 
 
Through the dark night through the rain 
Fighting machine we are risen again 
Striving forever more 
We will survive

Our swords will shine with honour 
Hatred fills the sky

STARFIRE

 Outside on a winter's night as the rain begins to fall 
There's a chill in the air and the howl of a wolf while the rain beats at the door 
Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high 
And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry 
 
When the dawn of a new day will see the light then the strongest hearts grow old 
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow 
 
Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead 
In the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one heard what once was said 
And the eagle fly through the clouds while earth bleeds dark and cold 
When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold 
 
When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold 
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow 
 
And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall 
Hoping for a better day never giving in 
Until we find the words till we find the words to say 
Until we find the words to say 
 
Burning starfire shine in the sky 
For the lives of great men who stand by your side 
When the night fall on we will ride 
For no lost souls will live on forever 
 
Dark night on the valley below still the horsemen follow through 
It's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill that inside the magic holds 
Seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies 
And the shadows of the night will no longer hide all their mysteries come undone 
 
When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold 
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow 
 
And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall 
Hoping for a better day never giving in 
Until we find the words till we find the words to say

VALLEY OF THE DAMNED

 On a cold dark winter night hidden by the stormy light 
A battle rages for the right for what will become 
In the valley of the damned a warrior with sword in hand 
Travels fast across the land for freedom he rides 
 
And the sign from the master on high screams aloud and across hear the cry 
For the kingdom of fire and ice and the power to be alive 
Be strong ride on, carry on through the war 
Come along carry on, living for ever more 
 
On the wings of death by the hands of doom 
By the darkest light from the darkest moon 
Crossing silent seas over mountains high 
For we stand as one tonight 
 
On the black wind forever we ride on together 
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide 
When the master will storm us 
He'll stand high before us 
Our hearts filled with splendour 
Our swords will shine over the light 
 
In the valley of the damned 
Days breaks with golden strand 
Over pastures green it glows 
To where night returns 
 
In the shadows faces appear 
Warriors wearing full metal gear 
All join together one and all 
Before the glorious light 
 
Rise up, gather around 
Come and hear what is said 
Use your senses open your mind 
Don't you ever forget 
 
On the wings of life, by the hands of hope 
By the brightest light from the brightest sun 
Crossing silent seas over mountains high
