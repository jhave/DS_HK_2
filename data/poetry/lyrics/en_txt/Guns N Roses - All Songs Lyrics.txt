14 YEARS

 I try and feel the sunshine 
You bring the rain 
You try and hold me down 
With your complains 
You cry and moan and complain 
You whine an tear 
Up to my neck in sorrow 
The touch you bring 
You just don't step inside to 
To 14 years 
So hard to keep my own head 
That's what I say 
You know... I've been the beggar I've played the thief 
I was the dog... they all tried to beat 
 
But it's been 
14 years of silence 
It's been 
14 years of pain 
It's been 
14 years that are gone forever 
And I'll never have again 
 
Your stupid girlfriends tell you 
That I'm to blame 
Well they're all used up has beens 
Out of the game 
This time I'll have the last word 
You hear what I say 
I tried to see it your way 
It won't work today 
You just don't step inside to 
To 14 years 
So hard to keep my own head 
That's what I say 
You know... I've been the dealer hangin' on your street 
I was the dog... they all tried to beat 
 
But it's been 
14 years of silence 
It's been 
14 years of pain 
It's been 
14 years that are gone forever 
And I'll never have again 
 
Bullshit and contemplation 
Gossip's their trade 
If they knew half the real truth 
What would they say 
Well I'm past the point of concern 
It's time to play 
These last 4 years of madness 
Sure put me straight 
Don't get back 14 years 
In just one day 
So hard to keep my own head 
Just go away 
You know... just like a hooker she said 
Nothin's for free 
Oh I tried to see it your way 
I tried to see it your way

 Diamonds and fast cars 
Money to burn 
I got my head in the clouds 
I got these thoughts to churn 
Got my feet in the sand 
I got a house on the hill 
I got a headache like a mother 
Twice the price of my thrills 
An it's a cold day it's a continental drift 
I said this traffic is hell 
Can you give me a lift 
An I'll try to paint a story 
Got your pictures to tell 
Yeah you got to make a living 
With what you bring yourself to sell 
 
I got some genuine 
Imitation 
Bad Apples 
Free sample 
For your peace o' mind 
Only $9.95 
I got my camera back from customs 
Got my law fees up to date 
Hell they musta seen me comin' 
Ain't this life so fuckin' great 
 
When the shit hit the fan 
It was all I could stand 
Yeah, well I'm a frequent flyer 
My body's breathing while it can 
But what I don't understand is that 
My world ain't gettin' no brighter 
If I could touch the sky 
Well I would float on by 
While everybody's talkin' 
Hell I'm just another guy 
If it were up to me 
I'd say just leave me be 
Why let one bad apple 
Spoil the whole damn bunch 
 
Gold and caviar 
Now why'nt you pour my apathy 
I'd have all my bases covered 
If I could teach my hands to see 
But now we're down in the deep end 
Where they'd love to watch you drown 
I said your laundry could use washing 
We'll hang it up all over town 
I said Hollywood's like a dryer 
An we're down on Sunset Strip 
An you'll be suckin' down the Clorox 
'Til your life's all nice and crisp

BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY

 Mama just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead. Mama, life had just begun, But now I've gone and thrown it all away. Mama, ooh, Didn't mean to make you cry, If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters. Too late, my time has come, Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time. Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go, Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth. Mama, ooh, I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all. I see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango. Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me. (Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo, Galileo figaro Magnifico. I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me. He's just a poor boy from a poor family, Spare him his life from this monstrosity. Easy come, easy go, will you let me go. Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. (Oh mama mia, mama mia.) Mama mia, let me go. Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me. So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye. So you think you can love me and leave me to die. Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby, Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here. Nothing really matters, Anyone can see, Nothing really matters, Nothing really matters to me. Any way the wind blows

BREAKDOWN

 We all come in from the cold 
We come down from the wire 
An everybody warms themselves to a different fire 
When sometimes we get burned 
You'd think sometime we'd learn 
The one you love is the one 
That should take you higher 
You ain't got no one 
You better go back out and find her 
 
Just like children hidin' in a closet 
Can't tell what's goin' on outside 
Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track 
We'll get taken for a ride 
By a parlor trick or some words of wit 
A hidden hand up a sleeve 
To think the one you love could hurt you now 
Is a little hard to believe 
But everybody darlin' sometimes 
Bites the hand that feeds 
 
When I look around 
Everybody always brings me down 
Well is it them or me 
Well I just can't see 
But there ain't no peace to found 
But if someone really cared 
Well they'd take the time to spare 
A moment to try and understand 
Another one's despair 
Remember in this game we call life 
That no one said it's fair 
 
BREAKDOWN 
Let me hear it now 
BREAKDOWN 
let me hear it now 
Yeah 
BREAKDOWN 
Let me hear it now 
BREAKDOWN 
Let me hear it now 
Get down with yo' bad self 
Alright 
 
I've come to know the cold 
I think of it as home 
When there ain't enough of me 
To go around 
I'd rather be left alone 
But if I call you out of habit 
I'm out of love and I gotta have it 
Would you give it to me 
If I fit you needs 
Like when we both knew we had it 
But now the damage's done 
And we're back out on the run 
Funny how ev'rything was ROSES 
When we held on to the GUNS 
Just because you're winnin' 
Don't mean you're the lucky one 
 
BREAKDOWN 
Let me hear it now 
BREAKDOWN 
Yeah 
BREAKDOWN 
BREAKDOWN 
Let me hear it now 
 
 There goes the challenger being chased 
By the blue blue meanies on wheels 
The vicious traffic squad cars are 
After our lone driver 
The last American hero 
The the electric sintar 
The demi god 
The super driver of the golden west! 
Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind 
The beautiful lone driver 
The police cars are getting closer closer... 
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile Yeah baby! 
They about to strike 
They gonna get him, SMASH! RAPE! 
The last beautiful free soul on this planet 
 
But... it is writen if the Evil Spirit 
Arms the Tiger with claws 
Brahman provided wings for the Dove 
Thus spake the Super Guru 
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

BRING IT BACK HOME

 Sweet little lady, don't you get crazy. 
Bring it back home to me. 
Woman little standing, dreaming to forget him. 
Bring it back home to me. 
When? Why wonder? 
Brown eyed stunner, come on, 
Bring it home to me. 
Kiss a little, fishing for your lover, 
Won't you bring it down home to me. 
 
See a sky lit on fire, seen the dog in here. 
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree. 
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin 
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her thing. 
 
You can see the love, like check an ounce for pain, 
Darling won't you wanna; 
Sorry to resent, you said; gimme back, 
Keep your teeth 
Never wanna hold you, 
Never wanna kiss you, 
I bet she's taking away from me. 
Never will repeat it, or never reprimand it, 
Will you bring it back home to me. 
 
Take care before my baby, 
When your baby gives it up for free. 
She just puts around, being lazy, 
But since she brings her lover to me. 
Don't need nothing to save me, say for a piece of your luxury. 
Like the doorfoot, you'll never gage it. 
I'll tell you just how it's gonna be. 
 
I call your lover in the morning, 
When you have your cup of tea. 
You never give me your warning, 
So you better give her right up for me. 
Guess who's coming over, on your thinks; 
That's such a surprise. 
If you're saying you never known her, 
 
Honey, you better open your eyes. 
Look out. 
 
See a real long fire, she's the dog in here. 
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree. 
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin. 
Break a back for her daddy, when she does her thing. 
 
Can't take care before my baby, 
When your baby gives it up for free. 
She just gets around being lazy, 
Until she brings her loving to me. 
I don't need nothing to save me, 
Say for a piece of your luxury. 
Lock the door, but you'll never gage me. 
I tell you just how it's gonna be. 
 
I call your lover in the morning, 
When you have your cup of tea. 
You never give me a warning, 
So get yourself a letter from me. 
Ohhhh, where're you going, tell me; who're you to see? 
I've been sleeping on your doorstep, 
Baby, won't you bring it back home to me. 
 
Get me something for my jealous mind, 
You don't get something for free. 
You just bring it down home to me.

CIVIL WAR

 WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE 
SOME MEN YOU JUST CAN'T REACH... 
SO, YOU GET WHAT WE HAD HERE LAST WEEK, 
WHICH IS THE WAY HE WANTS IT! 
WELL, HE GETS IT! 
N' I DON'T LIKE IT ANY MORE THAN YOU MEN. * 
 
(whistle) 
Look at your young men fighting 
Look at your women crying 
Look at your young men dying 
The way they've always done before 
 
Look at the hate we're breeding 
Look at the fear we're feeding 
Look at the lives we're leading 
The way we've always done before 
 
My hands are tied 
The billions shift from side to side 
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride 
For the love of God and our human rights 
And all these things are swept aside 
By bloody hands time can't deny 
And are washed away by your genocide 
And history hides the lies of our civil wars 
 
D'you wear a black armband 
When they shot the man 
Who said Peace could last forever 
And in my first memories 
They shot Kennedy 
I went numb when I learned to see 
So I never fell for Vietnam 
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all 
That you can't trust freedom 
When it's not in your hands 
When everybody's fightin' 
For their promised land 
 
And 
I don't need your civil war 
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers 
In a human grocery store 
Ain't that fresh 
I don't need your civil war 
Ow, oh no, no, no, no, no 
 
Look at the shoes you're filling 
Look at the blood we're spilling 
Look at the world we're killing 
The way we've always done before 
Look in the doubt we've wallowed 
Look at the leaders we've followed 
Look at the lies we've swallowed 
And I don't want to hear no more 
 
My hands are tied 
For all I've seen has changed my mind 
But still the wars go on as the years go by 
With no love of God or human rights 
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside 
By bloody hands of the hypnotized 
Who carry the cross of homicide 
And history bears the scars of our civil wars 
 
 WE PRACTICE SELECTIVE ANNIHILATION OF MAYORS AND 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FOR EXAMPLE TO CREATE A VACUUM 
THEN WE FILL THAT VACUUM AS POPULAR WAR ADVANTAGE 
PEACE IS CLOSER ** 
 
I don't need your civil war 
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers 
In a human grocery store 
Ain't that fresh 
And I don't need your civil war 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
I don't need your civil war 
I don't need your civil war

CIVIL WAR

 WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE 
SOME MEN YOU JUST CAN'T REACH... 
SO, YOU GET WHAT WE HAD HERE LAST WEEK, 
WHICH IS THE WAY HE WANTS IT! 
WELL, HE GETS IT! 
N' I DON'T LIKE IT ANY MORE THAN YOU MEN. * 
 
(whistle) 
Look at your young men fighting 
Look at your women crying 
Look at your young men dying 
The way they've always done before 
 
Look at the hate we're breeding 
Look at the fear we're feeding 
Look at the lives we're leading 
The way we've always done before 
 
My hands are tied 
The billions shift from side to side 
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride 
For the love of God and our human rights 
And all these things are swept aside 
By bloody hands time can't deny 
And are washed away by your genocide 
And history hides the lies of our civil wars 
 
D'you wear a black armband 
When they shot the man 
Who said Peace could last forever 
And in my first memories 
They shot Kennedy 
I went numb when I learned to see 
So I never fell for Vietnam 
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all 
That you can't trust freedom 
When it's not in your hands 
When everybody's fightin' 
For their promised land 
 
And 
I don't need your civil war 
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers 
In a human grocery store 
Ain't that fresh 
I don't need your civil war 
Ow, oh no, no, no, no, no 
 
Look at the shoes you're filling 
Look at the blood we're spilling 
Look at the world we're killing 
The way we've always done before 
Look in the doubt we've wallowed 
Look at the leaders we've followed 
Look at the lies we've swallowed 
And I don't want to hear no more 
 
My hands are tied 
For all I've seen has changed my mind 
But still the wars go on as the years go by 
With no love of God or human rights 
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside 
By bloody hands of the hypnotized 
Who carry the cross of homicide 
And history bears the scars of our civil wars 
 
 WE PRACTICE SELECTIVE ANNIHILATION OF MAYORS AND 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FOR EXAMPLE TO CREATE A VACUUM 
THEN WE FILL THAT VACUUM AS POPULAR WAR ADVANTAGE 
PEACE IS CLOSER ** 
 
I don't need your civil war 
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers 
In a human grocery store 
Ain't that fresh 
And I don't need your civil war 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
I don't need your civil war

COMA

 Hey you caught me in a coma 
And I don't think I wanna 
Ever come back to this... world again 
Kinda like it in a coma 
'Cause no one's ever gonna 
Oh, make me come back to this... world again 
Now I feel as if I'm floating away 
I can't feel all the pressure and I like it this way 
But my body's callin' 
My body's callin' 
Won't ya come back to this... world again 
Suspended deep in a sea of black 
I've got the light at the end 
I've got the bones on the mast 
Well I've gone sailin', I've gone sailin' 
I could leave so easily 
While friends are calling back to me 
I said they're 
They're leaving it all up to me 
When all I needed was clarity 
And someone to tell me 
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON 
GODDAMN IT! 
 
Slippin' farther an farther away 
It's a miracle how long we can stay 
In a world our minds created 
In a world that's full of shit 
 
HELP ME 
HELP ME 
HELP ME 
HELP ME 
BASTARD 
 
Please understand me 
I'm climbin' through the wreackage 
Of all my twisted dreams 
But this cheap investigation just 
can't stifle all my screams 
And I'm waitin' at the crossroads 
Waiting for you 
Waiting for you 
WHERE ARE YOU? 
 
No one's gonna bother me anymore 
No one's gonna mess with my head no more 
I can't understand what all the fightin's for 
But it's so nice here down off the shore 
I wish you could see this 'cause there's nothing to see 
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me 
Not like the world where I used to live 
I NEVER REALLY WANTED TO LIVE 
 
ZAP HIM AGAIN 
ZAP THE SON OF A BITCH AGAIN 
 
Ya live your life like it's a coma 
So won't you tell me why we'd wanna 
With all the reasons you give it's 
It's kinda hard to believe 
But who am I to tell you that I've seen 
Any reason why you should stay 
Maybe we'd be better off 
Without you anyway 
You got a one way ticket 
On your last chance ride 
Gotta one way ticket 
To your suicide 
Gotta one way ticket 
An there's no way out alive 
An all this crass communication 
That has left you in the cold 
Isn't much for consolation 
When you feel so weak and old 
But is home is where the heart is 
Then there's stories to be told 
No you don't need a doctor 
No one else can heal your soul 
 
Got your mind in submission 
Got your life on the line 
But nobody pulled the trigger 
They just stepped aside 
They be down by the water 
While you watch 'em waving goodbye 
They be callin' in the morning 
They be hangin' on the phone 
They be waiting for an answer 
But you know nobody's home 
And when the bell's stopped ringing 
It was nobody's fault but your own 
There were always ample warnings 
There were always subtle signs 
And you would have seen it comin' 
But we gave you too much time 
And when you said that no one's listening 
Why'd your best friend drop a dime 
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting 
For a way to spend our time 
An It's so easy to be social 
 It's so easy to be cool 
Yeah it's easy to be hungry 
When you ain't got shit to lose 
And I wish that I could help you 
With what you hope to find 
But I'm still out here waiting 
Watching reruns of my life 
When you reach the point of breaking 
Know it's gonna take some time 
To heal the broken memories 
That another man would need 
Just to survive

CRASH DIET

 Crash diet of reds'n'ludes 
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze 
Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose 
In your one track mind now 
Where's that leave you? 
 
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster baby 
Takin' your last ride 
Now better be so careful or you'll be dead before you time 
Sorry you took mother's car now 
 
Tears in my eyes, baby please don't go 
You bet (?!) one too many, now one for the road 
fresh outta detox, fresh from jail 
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell 
 
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster 
Takin' your last ride 
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time 
Sorry you took mohter's car now 
 
Too soon, you thought ... ?! 
Too late for the pressure and strain 
Too bad for those who don't believe it 
Ruby street still calls your name 
 
[guitar solo] 
 
Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive 
Smokin' a cig while you drink'n'drive 
With no control in your life ahead 
You're never gonna see if you wind up dead 
 
Drink'n'drive white lightning faster 
Takin' your last ride 
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time 
Drink'n'drive white lightning baby 
It's always on your mind 
Push or pull your limits baby, do it one more time 
Break it down 
Break it down 
Somethin''s changin', somethin''s breakin' 
You gotta be a brother, 'coz ?! your family 
?!.... Oh make it 
Sweet mystery, Ooohhhh

Would you please leave me alive 
Oooohhhh...

DEAD HORSE

 Sick of this life 
Not that you'd care 
I'm not the only one with whom these feelings I share 
 
Nobody understands, quite why we're here 
We're searchin' for answers 
That never appear 
 
But maybe if I looked real hard I'd 
I'd see your tryin' too 
To understand this life that we're all goin' through 
(Then when she said she was gonna like 
wreck my car... I didn't know what to do) 
 
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse 
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down 
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more 
It may sound funny but you'd think by now 
I'd be smilin' 
I guess some things never change 
Never change 
 
I met an old cowboy 
I saw the look in his eyes 
Somethin' tells me he's been here before 
'Cause experience makes you wise 
I was only a small child 
When the thought first came to me 
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son 
That brought back the devil in me 
 
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse 
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down 
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more 
It may sound funny but you'd think by now 
I'd be smilin' 
I guess some things never change 
Never change 
 
I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul 
Still wet behind the ears 
I been around this track a couple o' times 
But now the dust is startin' to clear 
Oh yeah!!! 
 
Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse 
An I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down 
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more 
It may sound funny but you'd think by now 
I'd be smilin' 
Ooh yeah, I'd be smilin'

Ooh smilin'

DON'T DAMN ME

 Don't damn me when I speak a piece of my mind 
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside 
'Cause I've been where I have been 
An I've seen what I have seen 
I put the pen to the paper 
'Cause it's all a part of me 
 
Be it a song or casual conversation 
To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations 
Your words once heard they can place you in a faction 
My words may disturb but at least there's a reaction 
 
Sometimes I wanna kill 
Sometimes I wanna die 
Sometimes I wanna destroy 
Sometimes I wanna cry 
Sometimes I could get even 
Sometimes I could give up 
Sometimes I could give 
Sometimes I never give a fuck 
 
It's only for a while 
I hope you understand 
I never wanted this to happen 
Didn't want to be a man 
So I hid inside my world 
I took what I could find 
I cried when I was lonely 
I fell down when I was blind 
 
But don't damn me when I speak a piece of my mind 
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside 
'Cause I've been where I have been 
An I've seen what I have seen 
I put the pen to the paper 
'Cause it's all a part of me 
 
How can I ever satisfy you 
An how can I ever make you see 
That, deep inside we're all somebody 
An it don't matter who you wanna be 
But now I gotta smile 
I hope you comprehend 
For this man can say it happened 
'Cause this child has been condemned 
So I stepped into your world I kicked you in the mind 
An I'm the only witness to the nature of my crime 
 
But look at what we've done to the innocent and young 
Whoa listen to who's talking 'cause we're not the only ones 
The trash collected by the eyes and dumped into the brain 
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts you tell me who's to blame 
 
I know you don't wanna hear me cryin' 
An I know you don't wanna hear me deny 
That your satisfaction lies in your ILLUSIONS 
But your delusions are yours and not mine 
We take for granted we know the whole story 
We judge a book by its cover and read what we want 
Between selected lines 
 
Don't hail me 
An don't idolize the ink 
Or I've failed in my intentions can you find the missing link 
Your only validation is living your own life 
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time 
So I send this song to the offended 
I said what I meant and I've never pretended 
As so many others do intending just to please 
If I damned your point of view could you turn the other cheek 
 
Don't damn me when I speak a piece of my mind 
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside 
'Cause I've been where I have been 
An I've seen what I have seen 
I put the pen to the paper 
'Cause it's all a part of me 
Don't damn me 
I said don't damn me 
I said don't hail me 
Don't damn me

DOWN ON THE FARM

 All I need is some inspiration 
Before I do somebody some harm 
I feel just like a vegetable 
Down here on the farm 
 
Nobody comes to see me 
Nobody here to turn me on 
I ain't even got a lover 
Down here on the farm 
 
They told me to get healthy 
They told me to get some sun 
But boredom eats me like cancer 
Down here on the farm 
 
Drinkin' lemonade shanty 
Ain't nobody here to do me harm 
But I'm like a fish out of water 
Down here on the farm 
 
I wrote a thousand letters 
Till my fingers all gone numb 
But I never see no postman 
Down here on the farm 
 
I call my baby on the telephone 
I say come down and have some fun 
But she knows what the score is 
Down here on the farm 
 
I can't fall in love with a wheatfield 
I can't fall in love with a barn 
When everything smells like horse shit 
Down here on the farm 
 
Blue skies and swimming pools 
Add so much charm 
But I'd rather be back in Soho 
Than down here on the farm 
 
On the fucking farm! 
 
Are you born in a fucking barn or what? 
 
Baaaaaah!

DUST IN THE WIND

 Tell everybody that I am sorry, truly sorry 
For all the wrong I've done 
I never meant to hurt nobody, no no 
Lord I never want to do no wrong 
 
And I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated 
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in 
And as I lay me down to take my rest 
I can see that it's just dust in the wind 
 
Take hold my hand, and hold it tighter, ever tighter 
You must believe that I love you still 
But my strength, it grows weaker, and weaker 
And my body has lost its will 
 
'Cause I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated 
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in 
And as I lay me down to take my rest 
I can see that it's just dust in the wind 
 
Oh Lord, I have lost once again 
And there's no one to help me find my way home 
Lord and I, Lord I never want to hurt nobody 
And I, Lord I never want to do no wrong 
 
'Cause I have lied, and I have begged and I have cheated 
And I know my ship, it won't be coming in 
And as I lay me down to take my rest 
I can see that it's just dust in the wind

Do as you got to, go your own way 
I said that's right 
Time's short your life's your own 
And in the end 
We are just 
Dust n' bones 
 


 

GUNS'N'ROSES
ESTRANGED

 When you're talkin to yourself 
And nobody's home 
You can fool yourself 
You came in this world alone 
(Alone) 
 
So nobody ever told you baby 
How it was gonna be 
So what'll happen to you baby 
Guess we'll have to wait and see 
ONE, TWO 
 
Old at heart but I'm only 28 
And I'm much too young 
To let love break my heart 
Young at heart but it's getting much too late 
To find ourselves so far apart 
 
I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately 
An what more could you ask from me 
How could you say that I never needed you 
When you took everything 
Said you took everything from me 
 
Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait 
When no one I know can seem to help me now 
Old at heart but I musn't hesitate 
If I'm to find my own way out 
 
Still talkin' to myself 
And nobody's home 
(Alone) 
 
So nobody ever told us baby 
How it was gonna be 
So what'll happen to us baby 
Guess we'll have to wait and see 
 
When I find out all the reasons 
Maybe I'll find another way 
Find another day 
With all the changing seasons of my life 
Maybe I'll get it right next time 
An now that you've been broken down 
Got your head out of the clouds 
You're back down on the ground 
And you don't talk so loud 
An you don't walk so proud 
Any more, and what for 
 
Well I jumped into the river 
Too many times to make it home 
I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone 
If it doesn't show give it time 
To read between the lines 
'Cause I see the storm getting closer 
And the waves they get so high 
Seems everything we've ever known's here 
Why must it drift away and die 
 
I'll never find anyone to replace you 
Guess I'll have to make it thru, this time Oh this time 
Without you 
 
I knew the storm was getting closer 
And all my friends said I was high 
But everything we've ever known's here 
I never wanted it to die

GARDEN OF EDEN

 It's a critical solution 
And the east coast got the blues 
It's a mass of confusion 
Like the lies they sell to you 
 
You got a glass jawed toothache 
Of a mental disease 
An they be runnin' round back 
See 'em line up on their knees 
'Cause the kiss ass sycophants 
Throwin' penance at your feet 
When they got nowhere to go 
Watch 'em come in off the streets 
While they're bangin' out front 
Inside their slammin' to the cruch 
Go on an throw me to the lions 
And the whole damn screamin' bunch 
'Cause the pissed off rip offs 
'R' everywhere you turn 
Tell me how a generation's ever s'posed to learn 
This fire is burnin' and it's out of control 
It's not a problem you can stop 
It's rock n' roll 
 
I read it on a wall 
It went straight to my head 
It said Dance to the tension of a world on edge 
We got racial violence and who'll cast the first stone 
And sex is used anyway it can be 
Sometimes when I look out 
It's hard to see the day 
It's a feelin' you can have it 
It's not mine to take away 
 
Lost in the garden of Eden 
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden 
And there's no one's gonna believe this 
But we're lost in the garden of Eden 
This fire is burnin' and it's out of control 
It's not a problem you can stop 
It's rock n' roll 
Suck on that 
 
Looking through this point of view 
There's no way I'm gonna fit in 
Don't ya tell me what my eyes see 
Don't ya tell me who to believe in 
I ain't superstitious 
But I know when somethin's wrong 
I've been draggin' my heels with a bitch called hope 
Let the undercurrent drag me along 
 
Lost in the garden of Eden 
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden 
And there's no one's gonna believe this 
But we're lost in the garden of Eden 
 
Most organized religions make a mockery of humanity 
Our governments are dangerous and out of control 
The garden of Eden is just another graveyard 
Said if they had someone to buy it 
Said I'm sure they'd sell my soul 
 
This fire is burnin' and it's out of control 
It's not a problem you can stop 
It's rock n' roll 
Lost in the garden of Eden 
(An we ain't talkin' about no poison apple 
or some missin' rib, ya hear) 
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden 
And there's no one's gonna believe this 
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden 
This fire is burnin' and it's out of control 
It's not a problem you can stop 
It's rock n' roll

HEARTBREAK HOTEL

 Well, since my baby left me, 
I found a new place to dwell. 
It's down at the end of lonely street 
at Heartbreak Hotel. 
 
You make me so lonely baby, 
I get so lonely, 
I get so lonely I could die. 
 
And although it's always crowded, 
you still can find some room. 
Where broken hearted lovers 
do cry away their gloom. 
 
You make me so lonely baby, 
I get so lonely, 
I get so lonely I could die. 
 
Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin', 
and the desk clerk's dressed in black. 
Well they been so long on lonely street 
They ain't ever gonna look back. 
 
You make me so lonely baby, 
I get so lonely, 
I get so lonely I could die. 
 
Hey now, if your baby leaves you, 
and you got a tale to tell. 
Just take a walk down lonely street 
to Heartbreak Hotel

HUMAN BEING

 1, 2, 3,4 
Oh yeeeahh 
Oh yeeeeeeahh 
 
Well if you don't like it 
Go ahead find yourself a saint 
Go ahead now try to find a boy 
Who's gonna be what I ain't 
 
What you need is a plastic doll 
With a fresh coat of paint 
Who's gonna sit through all the madness 
And always act so quaint 
I said a, oh yeah, well a 
 
It's your new friend 
You're really 
Making a scene, and I've seen you 
Bouncing around, from machine to machine 
But you know that 
 
They're never really 
Never really what they seem 
And you can count on 
Generate some warmth, then you'll 
See just what I mean 
Oh baby, baby, baby yeah 
 
CHORUS: 
 
And if I'm acting like a king 
Don't ya know it's cos uh I'm a human being 
And if I want too many things 
Don't ya know it's cos I'm a human being 
And if I've got to dream 
Don't ya know it's cos I'm a human being 
And when it gets a bit obscene 
Don't ya know it's cos I'm a human being 
I don't gotta walk around with my head on down 
Just like a human... oh no a human being 
I can hold my head so high 
Just like a human 
A real proud human being 
 
Won't you give me a little sip 
Why won't you give me a drag of that cigarette 
Why don't you try to give me something 
That I'll never ever forget, but now 
Could you blow it all 
On a million dollar bet 
Because you're liable to lose it 
On a best lovin' you've had yet 
Oh baby baby, oh yeah 
 
CHORUS 
 
It's like I'm talkin' 'bout the human race 
You're tryin' to cover up a big disgrace 
Oh baby, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 
Well I may think that 
This whole scene is just a too appalling for me 
Well, I may be the type who's just mad about 
Funny little thing that I see, but I can 
Colour that with history, and make it 
Just what I want it to be, well I'm 
Blowin' my change on the fan magazines 
With all the Hollywood refugees 
Oh baby baby oh yeah 
 
CHORUS 
 


 

GUNS'N'ROSES
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU

 Yeah! 
 
I'm from South Philadelphia up on Avenue C 
I've seen empty hands that was waitin' to freeze 
Up from the power at home 
 
CHORUS: 
 
I don't care about you 
Fuck you! 
I don't care about you 
Fuck you! 
 
I've seen Hollywood Boulevard 
Welfare hotel 
And I spent the night in jail 
At the Wilcox Hotel 
 
I don't care about you 
Fuck you! 
I don't care about you 
 
I've seen an old man have a heart attack in Manhattan 
Well he died while we just stood there lookin' at him 
Ain't he cute? 
 
I don't care about you 
Fuck you! 
I don't care about you 
 
I seen mad rollin' drunks 
I seen bodies in the streets 
I saw a man who was sleepin' in his own puke 
And a man with no legs crawlin' down 
Fifth Street tryin' just to get somethin' to eat 
 
I don't care about you 
Fuck you! 
I don't care about you 
Fuck you! 
I don't care about you

JUST ANOTHER SUNDAY

 I know you've been dreaming 'bout the times in our lives 
But I've been screaming in my bed late at night 
A space a little, little and your stack of pain 
Makes it grip that skull, to me child that you'll stay 
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you 
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
There's something I need to say before it's to late 
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay 
 
Just another Sunday 
Just another Sunday 
Oh yaaa, just another Sunday 
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa 
 
There's too many games in a day for a simple man to face 
That desperate moment in your life where you can't be afraid 
Don't think your second chance will break around the bend 
'Cos hearts don't always share love, or the person on the other 
end 
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you 
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
There's something I need to say before it's to late 
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay ya 
 
Just another Sunday yaa 
Just another Sunday oh baby 
It's only one more Sunday 
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa 
 
Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me 
'Cos felling the same pain makes half the luxery 
Take a walk away won't end the carousel 
But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well 
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you 
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue 
There's something I need to say before it's to late 
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay 
 
Just another Sunday yaa 
Just another Sunday oh baby 
It's only one more Sunday 
Just another Sunday 
It's just another Sunday 
It's just another 
Just another Sunday 
Just another oh yaa

LIVE AND LET DIE

 When you were young 
And your heart was an open book 
You used to say live and let live 
You know you did 
You know you did 
You know you did 
But if this ever changin' world 
In which we live in 
Makes you give in and cry 
Say live and let die 
Live and let die 
 
What does it matter to ya

LOCOMOTIVE

 Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness 
Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain 
If I said that you're my friend 
And our love would never end 
How long before I had your trust again 
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside 
Hopin' that you'd find your own way in 
But how can I protect you 
Or try not to neglect you 
When you won't take the love I have to give 
I bought me an illusion 
An I put it on the wall 
I let it fill my head with dreams 
And I had to have them all 
But oh the taste is never so sweet 
As what you'd believe it is 
Well I guess it never is 
It's these prejudiced illusions 
That pump the blood 
To the heart of the biz 
 
You know I never thought that it could take so long 
You know I never knew how to be strong 
Yeah, I let you shape me 
But I feel as though you raped me 
'Cause you climbed inside my world 
And in my songs 
So now I've closed the door 
To keep the cold outside 
Seems somehow I've found the will to live 
But how can I forget you 
Or try not to reject you 
When we both know it takes time to forgive 
 
Sweetness is a virtue 
And you lost your virtue long ago 
You know I'd like to hurt you 
But my conscience always tells me no 
You could sell your body on the street 
To anyone who looks like me 
Who'd love to try and get inside 
And bust your innocence open wide 
 
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive 
My baby's gone off the track 
My baby's got a locomotive 
Got ta peel the bitch off my back 
I know it looks like I'm insane 
Take a closer look I'm not to blame 
No! 
 
Gonna have some fun with my frustration 
Gonna watch the big screen in my head 
I'd rather take a detour 
'Cause this road ain't gettin' clearer 
Your train of thought has cut me off again 
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one 
Better tame that boy for he's a man 
Sweetheart don't make me laugh 
You's gettin' too big for your pants 
And I's think maybe you should 
Cut out while you can 
You can use you illusion 
Let it take you where it may 
We live and learn 
And then sometimes it's best to walk away 
Me I'm just here hangin' on 
It's my only place to stay at least 
For now anyway 
I've worked too hard for my illusions 
Just to throw them all away 
 
I'm taking time for quiet consolation 
In passing by this love that's passed away 
I know it's never easy 
So why should you believe me 
When I've always got so many things to say 
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made 
'Cause playful hearts 
Can sometimes be enraged 
You know I tried to wake you 
I mean how long could it take you 
To open up your eyes and turn the page 
 
Kindness is a treasure 
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown 
So I'll say it for good measure 
To all the ones like you I've known 
Ya know I'd like to shave your head 
And all my friends could paint it red 
'Cause love to me's a two way street 
An all I really want is peace 
 
But my baby's got a locomotive 
My baby's gone off the track 
My baby's got a locomotive 
Got ta peel the bitch off my back 
I know it looks like I'm insane 
Take a closer look I'm not to blame 
No! 
 
Affection is a blessing 
Can you find it in your sordid heart 
I tried to keep this thing ta gether 
But the tremor tore my pad apart 
Yeah I know it's hard to face 
When all we've worked for's gone to waste 
But you're such a stupid woman 
And I'm such a stupid man 
But love like time's got its own plans 
 
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive 
My baby's gone off the track 
My baby's got a locomotive 
Got ta peel the bitch off my back 
I know it looks like I'm insane 
Take a closer look I'm not to blame 
Yeah 
If love is blind I guess 
I'll buy myself a cane 
 
LOVE'S SO STRANGE

LOOK AT YOUR GAME, GIRL

 There's a time for living 
Time keeps on flying 
Think you're loving baby 
But all your doing is crying 
 
CHORUS: 
 
Can you feel 
Are those feelings real 
Look at your game, girl 
Look at your game, girl 
 
What a mad delusion 
Livingin that confusion 
Frustration and doubt 
Can you ever live without the game 
 
The sad, sad game 
Mad game 
Just to say loves' not enough 
If it can't be true 
Oh, you can tell those lies baby but you're only fooling you 
 
CHORUS 
 
Can you feel 
I know those feelings ain't real 
Then you better stop trying 
Or you're gonna play crying 
Stop trying 
Or you're gonna play crying 
Stop trying 
 
That's the game 
Sad sad game 
Mad game 
Sad game

 I won't be told anymore 
That I've been brought down in this storm 
And left so far out from the shore 
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore 
 
No I won't be told anymore 
That I've been brought back in this storm 
And left so far out from the shore 
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore 
 
No, I.. 
No, I... 
 
Forgive that they teared down my soul 
Bless them that they might grow old 
A dream that's forgotten may know 
That it's never too late 
 
So many times that I've seen life before me 
I searched and found the way to choose to the end 
I found a way, to know, why it had to be 
Mired in denial and saw all the rain 
 
If we ever find it true 
Love will have its way to choose 
Three more to tame 
We can be ever

 Your daddy works in porno 
Now that mommy's not around 
She used to love her heroin 
But now she's underground 
So you stay out late at night 
And you do your coke for free 
Drivin' your friends crazy 
With your life's insanity 
 
Well, well, well you just can't tell 
Well, well, well my Michelle 
LOOK OUT! 
 
Sowin' all your wild oats 
In another's luxuries 
Yesterday was Tuesday 
Maybe Thursday you can sleep 
But school starts much too early 
And this hotel wasn't free 
So party till your connection call 
Honey I'll return the key 
 
CHORUS: 
 
Well, well, well you just can't tell 
Well, well, well my Michelle 
Well, well, well you never can tell 
Well, well, well my Michelle 
 
Everyone needs love 
You know that it's true 
Someday you'll find someone 
That'll fall in love with you 
But oh the time it takes 
When you're all alone 
Someday you'll find someone 
That you can call your own 
But till then ya better... 
 
Now you're clean 
And so discreet 
I won't say a word 
But most of all this song is true 
Case you haven't heard 
So c'mon and stop your cryin' 
'Cause we both know money burns 
Honey don't stop tryin; 
An you'll get what you deserve

You cat scan shows disfiguration 
I wanna laugh myself to death 
With a misfired synapse with a bent configuration 
I'll hold the line while you gasp for breath 
You wanna talk to me 
So talk to me 
You wanna talk to me (7 times) 
You can't talk to me 
You don't understand your sex 
You ain't been mindfucked yet

I got a new rose, I got it good 
Yes, I knew that I always would 
I can't stop to mess around 
I got a brand new rose in town 
 
See the sun, see the sunny skies 
Don't get too close it'll burn your eyes 
Don't you run away that way 
Come back another day 
 
CHORUS 
 
I never thought this could happen to me 
I'm a strange washing machine 
I never served somebody this sane 
I haven't met her, maybe too late

NICE BOYS

 She hit town like a rose in bloom 
Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume 
The color faded and the petals died 
Down in the city, no one cried 
In the streets, the garbage lies 
Protected by a million flies 
The roaches so big 
You know that they got bones 
They moved in and made a tenement home 
 
I said nice boys 
Don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
I'm not a nice boy! 
 
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean 
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene 
She met the man and she did the smack 
Paid the price layin' flat on her back 
Wanted so bad just to please the boys 
They ended up just being a toy 
Played so hard burned her life away 
Lies were told no promises made 
 
You know nice boys 
Don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
I'm not a nice boy and I never was! 
 
Young and fresh when she hit town 
Hot for kicks just to get around 
But now she lays in a filthy room 
She kills the pain with 
A flick and a spoon 
And in the streets the garbage lies 
Protected by a million flies 
You know the roaches so big 
You know that they got bones 
Moved in and made a tenement home 
 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no baby 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
I bet you mama said 
'Nice boys don't play rock and roll' 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys!

 She hit town like a rose in bloom 
Smellin' sweet, said sweet perfume 
The color faded and the petals died 
Down in the city, no one cried 
In the streets, the garbage lies 
Protected by a million flies 
The roaches so big 
You know that they got bones 
They moved in and made a tenement home 
 
I said nice boys 
Don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
I'm not a nice boy! 
 
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean 
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene 
She met the man and she did the smack 
Paid the price layin' flat on her back 
Wanted so bad just to please the boys 
They ended up just being a toy 
Played so hard burned her life away 
Lies were told no promises made 
 
You know nice boys 
Don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
I'm not a nice boy and I never was! 
 
Young and fresh when she hit town 
Hot for kicks just to get around 
But now she lays in a filthy room 
She kills the pain with 
A flick and a spoon 
And in the streets the garbage lies 
Protected by a million flies 
You know the roaches so big 
You know that they got bones 
Moved in and made a tenement home 
 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no baby 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
I bet you mama said 
'Nice boys don't play rock and roll' 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys don't play rock and roll 
Nice boys!

NOVEMBER RAIN

 When I look into your eyes 
I can see a love restrained 
But darlin' when I hold you 
Don't you know I feel the same 
 
'Cause nothin' lasts forever 
And we both know hearts can change 
And it's hard to hold a candle 
In the cold November rain 
 
We've been through this such a long long time 
Just tryin' to kill the pain 
 
But lovers always come and lovers always go 
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today 
Walking away 
 
If we could take the time to lay it on the line 
I could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine 
All mine 
So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain 
Or I'll just end up walkin' in the cold November rain 
 
Do you need some time... on your own 
Do you need some time... all alone 
Everybody needs some time... on their own 
Don't you know you need some time... all alone 
 
I know it's hard to keep an open heart 
When even friends seem out to harm you 
But if you could heal a broken heart 
Wouldn't time be out to charm you 
 
Sometimes I need some time... on my own 
Sometimes I need some time... all alone 
Everybody needs some time... on their own 
Don't you know you need some time... all alone 
 
And when your fears subside and shadows still remain, oh yeah 
I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame 
So never mind the darkness we still can find a way 
'Cause nothin' lasts forever even cold November rain 
 
You're not the only one 
You're not the only one 
Don't ya think that you need somebody 
Don't ya think that you need someone 
Everybody needs somebody 
You're not the only one 
You're not the only one 
 
Don't ya think that you need somebody 
Don't ya think that you need someone

OH MY GOD

 It's not how you're thinking 
Like you've been right 
You've been living a trade off 
Believe your own version 
Believe your enslavery and drain out your soul 
What can I do when there's so many liars 
That crawl through your veins 
Like millions of spiders 
That seek out their victims 
And ruin the wiser 
Watch out 
Gotcha 
 
Oh my god 
I can't deny this 
I've been taught just to kill and fight this 
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it 
Like nobody wanted to know 
 
So give it away 
Like they're not gonna fuck you 
How long can you bear him 
To come back and haunt you 
To burn past your feelings 
And cause you to suffer 
You're starting to bleed 
They don't give you up 
Before its too late 
What will you offer 
In way of a healing 
I'm so confused, abused, misused 
 
Oh my god 
I can't deny this 
I've been taught just to kill and fight this 
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it 
Like nobody wouldn't know 
 
Ooh, if it opens your eyes 
This is better than a strong compromise 
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle 
If only you had let me know 
Ooh, if it opens your eyes 
This is better than the last compromise 
I was willing to be lost in the shadows 
If only you had let me know 
 
And they wont give in 
Cause they know what they're after 
A kick in the face 
Like its all that would matter 
Ohh 
 
Oh my god 
I can't deny this 
I've been taught just to murder and fight this 
To bury it deeper where no one can find it 
Cuz nobody wouldn't know 
 
Ooh, if it opens your eyes 
This is better than a good compromise 
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle 
If only you had let me know 
 
Ooh, well its on with the show 
Like the tide down on the ocean 
The waves already set in motion 
The only one in the game that's lost is you

ONE IN A MILLION

 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4 
(Whistle) 
Guess I needed sometime to get away 
I needed some piece of mind 
Some piece of mind that'll stay 
So I thumbed it down to Sixth and L.A. 
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way 
 
Police and Niggers, that's right 
Get out of my way 
Don't need to buy none of your 
Gold chains today 
I don't need no bracelets 
Clamped in front of my back 
Just need my ticket; 'til then 
Won't you cut me some slack? 
 
You're one in a million 
Yeah, that's what you are 
You're one in a million, babe 
You're a shooting star 
Maybe someday we'll see you 
Before you make us cry 
You know we tried to reach you 
But you were much too high 
Much too high, much too high 
Much too high, yes, ow! 
 
Immigrants and fagets 
They make no sense to me 
They come to our country 
And think they'll do as they please 
Like start some mini Iran 
Or spread some fuckin' disease 
They talk so many goddamn ways 
It's all Greek to me 
 
Well some say I'm lazy 
And others say that's just me 
Some say I'm crazy 
I guess I'll always be 
But it's been such a long time 
Since I knew right from wrong 
It's all the means to an end, I 
I keep it movin' along 
 
You're one in a million 
Oo, you're a shooting star 
You're one in a million, babe 
You know that you are 
Maybe someday we'll see you, oo 
Oh, Before you make us cry 
You know we tried to reach you 
But you were much too high 
Much too high, Oo, much too high 
Yeah, 
Much too high, huh, no, no, oh 
Ow! 
 
Radicals and Racists 
Don't point your finger at me 
I'm a small town white boy 
Just tryin' to make ends meet 
Don't need your religion 
Don't watch that much T.V. 
Just makin' my livin', baby 
Well that's enough for me 
 
You're one in a million 
Yeah that's what you are 
You're one in a million, babe 
You're a shooting star 
Maybe someday we'll see you 
Before you make us cry 
You know we tried to reach you 
But you were much too high 
Much too high, ow, much too high 
Much too high, much too high 
Yeah, yeee, yeah, yeee, igh! 
Ow! Much too high

 Man's got his woman to take his seed 
He's got the power oh 
She's got the need 
She spends her life through pleasing up her man 
She feeds him dinner or anything she can 
She cries alone at night too often 
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all 
 
Only women bleed 
Only women bleed 
Only women bleed 
 
Man makes your hair gray 
He's your life's mistake 
All you're really lookin' for is an even break 
He lies right at you 
You know you hate this game 
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain 
She cries alone at night too often 
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all 
 
Only women bleed 
Only women bleed 
Only women bleed 
 
Only women bleed 
Only women bleed 
Only women bleed 
 
Black eyes all of the time 
Don't spend a dime 
Clean up this grime

Watch me bleed. 
 
Only women bleed

And the girls are pretty 
I want you please take me home 
 
CHORUS: 
 
Take me down 
To the paradise city 
Where the grass is green 
And the girls are pretty 
Take me home 
 
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber 
Why I'm here I can't quite remember 
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe 
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see 
Tell me who you're gonna believe 
 
CHORUS 
 
Take me down 
To the paradise city 
Where the grass is green 
And the girls are pretty 
I want you please take me home 
 
So far away 
So far away 
So far away 
So far away 
 
Captain America's been torn apart 
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart 
He said 
Turn me around and take me back to the start 
I must be losin' my mind Are you blind? 
I've seen it all a million times 
 
CHORUS 
 
Take me down 
To the paradise city 
Where the grass is green 
And the girls are pretty 
I want you please take me home 
 
CHORUS

An I think he's got somethin' to say 
 You wanna fuck with me, don't fuck with me 
'Cause I'm what you'll be so don't fuck with me

I said I'm right next door to hell 
An so many eyes are on me 
Right next door to hell 
I got nowhere else to be

Feels like the walls are closing in on me 
 
My mama never really said much to me 
She was much too young and scared ta be 
Hell Freud might say that's what I need 
But all I really ever get is greed 
An most my friends they feel the same 
Hell we don't even have ourselves to blame 
But times are hard and thrills are cheaper 
As your arms get shorter 
Your pockets get deeper 
 
Right next door to hell 
Why don't you write a letter to me 
I said I'm right next door to hell 
An so many eyes are on me

Raise your glass to the hard working people, 
Lets drink to the uncounted heads. 
Lets think of the wandering millions,

And a parade of the gray suited grafters, 
A choice of cancer or polio.

Your program's over? 
 
This ain't no sentimental movie 
Yeah, you look so cool 
Don't take me for another one of your scenes? 
This ain't no sentimental movie 
This ain't no sentimental movie 
The tears you cried 
All the tears you cried tonight 
Yeah 
This ain't no sentimental movie 
This ain't no sentimental movie 
This ain't no sentimental movie 
Yea

SHADOW OF YOUR LOVE

 Took my chances carelessly 
choked on my own cigarette 
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby 
but you aint seen the worst yet 
 
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun 
and the woman who is dead 
who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one 
 
And I ain't standing, never standing 
in the shadow of your love 
shadow of your love 
shadow of your love 
shadow of your love 
 
Wrote my changes helplessly 
yeah but I got no regrets 
Money it was on the table 
so I booked with all the bets 
 
Living like a lemon aint so hot 
and you aint my idea 
of one high rollin' shot 
 
No I ain't standing, never standing 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Big dark clouds hanging over your head 
hope you've heard, baby all I've said 
You've been told, what I've said 
No use crying, you're as good as dead 
 
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun 
and the woman who is dead, who is out alright 
now I'm not the only one 
 
And I ain't standing, never standing

SHOTGUN BLUES

 I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't wait here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
 
An now you're blowin' smoke 
I think you're one big joke 
Me... I gotta lot to learn 
An I'm still waitin' for the heads to turn 
You say I walk a line 
Fuck they move it every time 
You walk a mile in my shoes 
And then you tell me 'bout singin' the blues 
You get what you pay for 
An freedom's real high priced 
An while your rippin' off children 
Somebody's fuckin' your wife 
It's never made a difference 
It's only how you survive 
 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't wait here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
An now you ask me why 
I said it's do or die 
I'll stick it right in your face 
And then I'll put you in your motherfuckin' place 
And you... you can suck my ass 
An I think it's so low class 
Me... I'm just so concerned 
I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn 
Ooh you want a confrontation 
I'll give you every fuckin' chance 
With your verbal masturbation 
Me... I just like to dance 
How's that for provocation 
I'm just makin' a stance 
An I'm tired of the frustration 
Of livin' inside of your lies 
And I'm wired on indignation 
I said somebody's got to die 
Oooooh, yeah! 
 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't stay here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
Listen motherfucker 
You're about to pay your dues 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
If you're goin' up against me 
Then you know you're gonna lose 
I know

SWEET CHILD O' MINE

 She's got a smile that it seems to me 
Reminds me of childhood memories 
Where everything 
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
Now and then when I see her face 
She takes me away to that special place 
And if I stared too long 
I'd probably break down and cry 
 
Sweet child o' mine 
Sweet love of mine 
 
She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
As if they thought of rain 
I hate to look into those eyes 
And see an ounce of pain 
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
Where as a child I'd hide 
And pray for the thunder 
And the rain 
To quietly pass me by

SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL

 Please allow me to introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
I've been around for a long, long year 
Stole many a man's soul and faith 
 
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 
Had his moment of doubt and pain 
Made damn sure that Pilate 
Washed his hands and sealed his fate 
 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game 
 
I stuck around St. Petersberg 
When I saw it was a time for a change 
Killed the Czar and his ministers 
Anastasia screamed in vain 
 
I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank 
When the Blitzkrieg raged 
And the bodies stank 
 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah 
What's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah 
 
I watched with glee 
While your kings and queens 
Fought for ten decades 
For the Gods they made 
 
I shouted out 
 Who killed the Kennedys? 
When after all 
It was you and me 
 
Let me please introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
And I laid traps for troubadors 
Who get killed before they reached Bombay 
 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby 
 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's confusing you 
Is just the nature of my game 
 
Just as every cop is a criminal 
And all the sinners saints 
As heads is tails 
Just call me Lucifer 
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 
 
So if you meet me 
Have some courtesy 
Have some sympathy, and some taste 
Use all your well learned politesse 
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah 
 
Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game, um baby, get down 
 
Woo, who 
Oh yeah, get on down 
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah! 
 
Tell me baby, what's my name 
Tell me honey, baby guess my name 
Tell me baby, what's my name 
I tell you one time, you're to blame 
 
Ooo, who 
Ooo, who 
Ooo, who 
Ooo, who, who 
Ooo, who, who 
Ooo, who, who

THE BLUES

 All the love in the world couldn't save you 
All the innocence inside 
You know I tried so hard to make you 
To make you change your mind 
 
And it hurts too much to see you 
And how you left yourself behind 
You know I didn't want to meet you 
Now there's a hell I can't describe 
 
So now I wander through my day 
Trying to find my way 
Still these feelings that I felt 
I said to you and no one else 
 
And no it's not going to change 
I know it's gone, still I'm used 
And that's nice to hang on someone 
A change that's bittersweet 
 
That's called the blues 
 
Don't know just what I should do 
Everywhere I go I see you 
You know it's what you planned, this much is true 
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore 
 
I don't know just what I should do 
Everywhere I go I see you 
You know it's what we planned, this much is true 
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore 
 
What this means to me 
The more I know you believe 
What I thought was you now 
Has got more that it changed on you 
 
What I thought was true 
The more that I might know is you 
What I thought was you 
Is only memories, distant

THE GARDEN

 You know you're all alone 
Your friends they aren't at home 
Everybody's gone to the garden 
As you look into the trees 
You can look but you don't see 
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden 
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care 
What's it with you man, and this garden 
 
TURNED INTO MY WORST PHOBIA, 
A CRAZY MAN'S UTOPIA 
IF YOU'RE LOST NO ONE CAN SHOW YA, 
BUT IT SURE WAS GLAD TO KNOW YA 
ONLY POOR BOYS TAKE A CHANCE, 
ON THE GARDEN'S SONG AND DANCE, 
FEEL HER FLOWERS AS THEY WRAP AROUND, 
BUT ONLY SMART BOYS DO WITHOUT 
 
You can find it all inside 
No need to wrestle with your pride 
No you ain't losin' your mind 
You're just in the garden 
They can lead you to yourself 
Or you can throw it on the shelf 
But you know you can look inside 
For the garden 
 
I WASN'T REALLY SCARED 
LOST MY VIRGINITY THERE, 
TO A GYPSY WITH BLOND HAIR 
BUT NOW NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE 
LIKE A MOUSE INSIDE A MAZE 
WANDERING ROUND 4 DAZE 
WITH A SMILE UPON MY FACE, 
I NEVER WANNA LEAVE THIS PLACE 
ONLY POOR BOYS TAKE A CHANCE, 
ON THE GARDEN'S SONG AND DANCE, 
FEEL HER FLOWERS AS THEY WRAP AROUND, 
BUT ONLY SMART BOYS DO WITHOUT 
TURNED INTO MY WORST PHOBIA, 
IT'S A CRAZY MAN'S UTOPIA 
IF YOU'RE LOST NO ONE CAN SHOW YA, 
BUT IT SURE WAS GLAD TO KNOW YA

TOO MUCH TOO SOON

 Hey this bottle's empty, you got 2 bucks? 
C'mon, we'll buy a bottle 
Alright, I'm headin' to the store and I'm gonna buy smokes 
Hot damn 
 
Every night, I go out and get in my car, oh yeah 
I push on the peddle but you know I go too far 
There're parties everywhere that I can see 
Usin' myself will be the death of me 
Ya see every night I get a call on the telephone 
My sweet little baby beggin' me just to come home 
But I know that everyday I gotta have me some fun 
With Suzy to the left and Sally to my right 
I know that I need just more than one 
 
[Chorus] 
 
Said it's too much too fast 
I don't care if I won't last 
Said it's too much too soon 
I don't care, get outta my room 
Said it's too much too fast 
I don't care if I won't last 
Said it's too much too soon 
I don't care, get outta my room 
 
Let's go 
 
When the night goes on and I seem to see some friends 
Now a buck for the car for the gas goes so fast? 
With friends like that tell me who's gonna last 
Well the city's hot but tonight I'm not 
I want everything that everybody's got 
Not a badge in the pan or a legend hand 
Just give me one more, one last dance 
 
Said it's too much too fast 
I don't care if I won't last 
Said it's too much too soon 
I don't care, get outta my room 
Said it's too much too fast 
I don't care if I won't last 
Said it's too much too soon 
I don't care, get outta my room 
 
Let's go 
 
Take the car, take the keys 
Said my money don't grow on trees 
You make me stumble and fall 
T'ill I'm bloody at my knees? 
I climbed back up to find that all my money's gone 
Too much too soon not know since it's been so long? 
You can drive me to the edge but I really don't mind 
Ya see when I'm in my car I leave you behind 
There's another girl that's waitin' down the road 
When I'm out the door you know that's just where I'll go 
 
Said it's too much too fast 
I don't care if I won't last 
Said it's too much too soon 
I don't care, get outta my room 
Said it's too much too fast 
I don't care if I won't last 
Said it's too much too soon 
I don't care, get outta my room 
 
Said it's too much too fast 
I don't care if I won't last 
Said it's too much too soon 
I don't care, get outta my room 
Said it's too much too fast 
I don't care if I won't last

WILD HORSES

 Childhood living is easy to do 
The things you wanted 
I bought them for you graceless lady 
You know who I am 
You know I can't let you slide through my hand 
 
Wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away 
Wild, wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away 
 
I watched you suffer 
A dull aching pain 
Now you're decided 
To show me the same 
No sweeping exits 
Or offstage lines 
Could make me feel bitter 
Or treat you unkind 
 
I know I've dreamed you 
A sin n' a lie 
I have my freedom 
But I dont have much time 
Faith has been broken 
Tears must be cried 
Let's do some living 
After we die 
 
Wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away 
Wild, wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away

YESTERDAYS

 Yesterday 
There was so many things 
I was never told 
Now that I'm startin' to learn 
I feel I'm growing old 
 
'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Old pictures that I'll always see 
Time to spin the pages 
In my book of memories 
Prayers in my pocket 
And no hand in destiny 
I'll keep on movin' along 
With no time to plant my feet 
 
'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Old pictures that I'll always see 
Some things could be better 
If we'd all just let them be 
 
Ooh yesterday's got nothin' for me 
Yesterday's, Ooh got nothin' for me 
Got nothin' for me, yeah 
 
Yesterday 
There was so many things 
I was never shown 
Suddenly this time I found 
I'm on the streets and I'm all alone

All the smart boys know why

It's isn't 'cause I'm all alone 
Oh, baby, you're not home 
And when I'm home 
Big deal, I'm still alone 
 
It's so restless, I am 
Beat my head against a pole 
Try to knock some sense, down 'side my bones 
And even though it don't show 
Those guys are so old 
Can't put your arms around a memory 
Can't put your arms around a memory 
Can't put your arms around a memory 
Don't try

You're just a basket case 
And you got no name 
Could you live with me?
