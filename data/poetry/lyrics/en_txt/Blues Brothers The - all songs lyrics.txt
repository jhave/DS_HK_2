BLUES BROTHERS (THE)
CAN'T PLAY THE BLUES IN AN AIRCONDITIONED ROOM

 All my life I had to struggle, I paid some heavy dues 
Squeekin' out a livin', playin' easy blues 
Then one day my music made me a millionaire 
I bought a big old mansion with central heated air 
Now I got more money than I know how to use 
Got everything a man could want, but I ain't got no blues 
Success for me could only lead to my immediate doom 
'cause I can't play the blues in an airconditioned room 
 
Now I was doin' better with a smaller piece of pie 
But all my fame and fortune I can't identify 
I lost the inspiration that came natural in the start 
I have to have a mean old woman, just to break my heart 
Now my life's too easy, I'd be getting soft 
I used to play the blues all day, but now I just play golf 
Now all my pain is rearranged, my life is changes too 
'cause I can't play the blues in an airconditioned room 
 
 
You know what I'm saying 
It's kinda hard to play the blues 
if you don't have any problems 
 
 
You might think I'm crazy, you might think I'm strange 
The first thing in the morning I'm gonna make a change 
I throw away my money, I move back to that shag 
Do whatever I gotta do to get that old feelin' back 
I know I'd be feelin' better with nothing left to lose 
When times are bad, the less I had, the better I played the blues 
I buy myself some turkey and wine, and howl it at the moon 
'cause I can't play the blues in an airconditioned room 
 
 
If I should die tomorrow you can write it on my tomb 
'He couldn't play the blues in an airconditioned room'

On horses snortin fire... as they ride they hear their cry

SHOTGUN BLUES

 Every night I go to sleep 
The blues fall down like rain 
Every night I go to sleep 
The blues fall down like rain 
Taking pills, cheap whiskey 
Just to try to ease the pain 
 
 
Well it's hard to gamble 
When you lose every bet 
Hard to save money 
When you're twenty years in debt 
The blues is falling 
Falling down on me like rain 
I'm gonna take a shotgun now people 
And disconnect my brain 
Matt 'Guitar' Murphy! 
 
 
I made some mistakes 
Had some bad breaks 
Now my mind don't work 
And my whole body aches 
The blues is falling 
Falling down on me like rain 
My life is like water 
Just swirling down the drain 
 
 
Well I tried standin' up 
I keep on falling down 
Tried standing up 
Keep on fallin' down 
Everywhere I go 
The blues is all around

STAND BY YOUR MAN

 Sometimes it's hard to be a woman 
Giving all your love to just one man 
And if you love him 
O be proud of him 
'Cause after all he's just a man 
 
 
Stand by your man 
Give him two arms to cling to 
And something warm to come to 
when nights are cold and lonely 
Stand by your man 
And tell the world you love him 
Keep givin' all the love you can 
Baby, stand by your man

THE BLUES DON'T BOTHER ME

 If you're wonderin' 
What's all the noise 
I'm in the backroom 
With the girls and boys 
Were' discussing the blues 
And they don't seem to see 
The blues is all I play 
The blues don't bother me 
 
When I was a little boy 
Sittin' on my papa's knee 
I coulden't a been no older than two or three 
He said I am a blues man 
You're gonna take after me 
After me 
The blues is my companion 
The blues don't bother me 
They don't bother me 
No they don't 
 
 
When I go to bed at night 
I'll throw on a record or two 
If I didn't have these blues 
I woulden't know what to do 
I need them to soothe me 
To ease my misery 
The blues is my companion 
They don't bother me 
They don't bother me 
The blues don't bother me 
They don't bother me 
keeps me company 
I got the blues 
Relieves my misery 
Keeps me company 
The blues don't bother me 
I got the blues
