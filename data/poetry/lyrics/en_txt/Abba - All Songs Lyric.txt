ANGELEYES

 Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes I keep thinking Last night I was taking a walk along the river And I saw him together with a young girl And the look that he gave her made me shiver 'Cause he always used to look at me that way And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say It's a game he likes to play Look into his angeleyes One look and you're hypnotized He'll take your heart and you must pay the price Look into his angeleyes You'll think you're in paradise And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise Don't look too deep into those angeleyes Oh no no no no Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes I keep thinking Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him And it hurts to remember all the good times When I thought I could never live without him And I wonder does it have to be the same Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain How can I forget that name Look into his angeleyes One look and you're hypnotized He'll take your heart and you must pay the price Look into his angeleyes You'll think you're in paradise And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise Don't look too deep into his angeleyes Crazy 'bout his angeleyes Angeleyes Once he took my heart and now I pay the price Look into his angeleyes You'll think you're in paradise And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise Don't look too deep into those angeleyes Oh no no no no Keep thinking Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes Keep thinking Keep thinking, I had to pay the price

ANOTHER TOWN, ANOTHER TRAIN

 Day is dawning and I must go You're asleep but still I'm sure you'll know Why it had to end this way You and I had a groovy time But I told you somewhere down the line You would have to find me gone I just have to move along Just another town, another train Waiting in the morning rain Lord give my restless soul a little patience Just another town, another train Nothing lost and nothing gained Guess I will spend my life in railway stations Guess I will spend my life in railway stations When you wake I know you'll cry And the words I wrote to say goodbye They won't comfort you at all But in time you will understand That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand For a no good bum like me To live is to be free Just another town, another train Waiting in the morning rain Lord give my restless soul a little patience Just another town, another train Nothing lost and nothing gained Guess I will spend my life in railway stations Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

CASSANDRA

 Down in the street they're all singing and shouting Staying alive though the city is dead Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter While you are crying alone on your bed Pity Cassandra that no one believed you But then again you were lost from the start Now we must suffer and sell our secrets Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood Now the last day is dawning Some of us wanted but none of us could Listen to words of warning But on the darkest of nights Nobody knew how to fight And we were caught in our sleep Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe You really had the power I only saw it as dreams you would weave Until the final hour So in the morning your ship will be sailing Now that your father and sister are gone There is no reason for you to linger You're grieving deeply but still moving on You know the future is casting a shadow No one else sees it but you know you're fate Packing your bags, being slow and thorough Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood Now the last day is dawning Some of us wanted but none of us could Listen to words of warning But on the darkest of nights Nobody knew how to fight And we were caught in our sleep Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe You really had the power I only saw it as dreams you would weave Until the final hour I watched the ship leaving harbour at sunrise Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain She stood on deck, just a tiny figure Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood Now the last day is dawning Some of us wanted but none of us could Listen to words of warning But on the darkest of nights Nobody knew how to fight And we were caught in our sleep Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe You really had the power I only saw it as dreams you would weave Until the final hour I'm sorry Cassandra I'm sorry Cassandra

HAMLET III

 When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground When the air gets cold then I think of us Of you and I And it almost makes me cry So sad and kind of bitter sweet And the memories filled with tears And I feel my heart will break Guess it all was my mistake Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees The rain fell softly on your face Oh I remember every little thing about that day I remember every place Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds The rain fell softly on your face The memories of our time together cannot be replaced I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

HAPPY NEW YEAR

 No more champagne And the fireworks are through Here we are, me and you Feeling lost and feeling blue It's the end of the party And the morning seems so grey So unlike yesterday Now's the time for us to say Happy new year Happy new year May we all have a vision now and then Of a world where every neighbour is a friend Happy new year Happy new year May we all have our hopes, our will to try If we don't we might as well lay down and die You and I Sometimes I see How the brave new world arrives And I see how it thrives In the ashes of our lives Oh yes, man is a fool And he thinks he'll be okay Dragging on, feet of clay Never knowing he's astray Keeps on going anyway Happy new year Happy new year May we all have a vision now and then Of a world where every neighbour is a friend Happy new year Happy new year May we all have our hopes, our will to try If we don't we might as well lay down and die You and I Seems to me now That the dreams we had before Are all dead, nothing more Than confetti on the floor It's the end of a decade In another ten years time Who can say what we'll find What lies waiting down the line In the end of eighty nine Happy new year Happy new year May we all have a vision now and then Of a world where every neighbour is a friend Happy new year Happy new year May we all have our hopes, our will to try If we don't we might as well lay down and die You and I

HE IS YOUR BROTHER

 I was a fighter always looking for trouble And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for But then it happened one night as I got into a fight I could hear someone saying as though he was praying Treat him well, he is your brother You might need his help one day We depend on one another Love him, that's the only way On the road (on the road) that we're going We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion Treat him well, he is your brother Love him, that's the only way I was a woman never thinking of others And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying Treat him well, he is your brother (brother) You might need his help one day (he's your brother) We depend on one another (brother) Love him, that's the only way On the road (on the road) that we're going (that we're going) We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion Treat him well, he is your brother (brother) Love him, that's the only way Treat him well, he is your brother (brother) You might need his help one day (he's your brother) We depend on one another (brother) Love him, that's the only way

HEAD OVER HEELS

 I have a very good friend The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend She has a personal style Some people like it, others tend to go wild You hear her voice everywhere Taking the chair She's a leading lady And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going Head over heels Breaking her way Pushing through unknown jungles every day She's a girl with a taste for the world (The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing) Head over heels Setting the pace Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace She's extreme, if you know what I mean Her man is one I admire He's so courageous but he's constantly tired Each time when he speaks his mind She pats his head and says, That's all very fine Exert that will of your own When you're alone Now we'd better hurry And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going Head over heels Breaking her way Pushing through unknown jungles every day She's a girl with a taste for the world (The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing) Head over heels Setting the pace Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace She's extreme, if you know what I mean You hear her voice everywhere Taking the chair She's a leading lady And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going Head over heels Breaking her way Pushing through unknown jungles every day She's a girl with a taste for the world (The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing) Head over heels Setting the pace Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace She's extreme, if you know what I mean (She's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please) And she goes Head over heels

I LET THE MUSIC SPEAK

 I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs No poet has ever painted Voices call out to me, straight to my heart So strange yet we're so well acquainted I let the music speak, with no restraints I let my feelings take over Carry my soul away into the world Where beauty meets the darkness of the day Where my mind is like an open window Where the high and healing winds blow From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me I let them take me (Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me) Let it be a joke Let it be a smile Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while Let it be a tear Let it be a sigh Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn Rustling down an old alley And in the dead of night I find myself A blind man in some ancient valley I let the music speak, leading me gently Urging me like a lover Leading me all the way Into a place Where beauty will defeat the darkest day Where I'm one with every grand illusion No disturbance, no intrusion Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me I let them use me (All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion) Let it be a joke Let it be a smile Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while Let it be a tear Let it be a sigh Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry Let it be a tear Let it be a sigh Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry Let it be the joy of each new sunrise Or the moment when a day dies I surrender without reservation No explanations No questions why I take it to me and let it flow through me Yes, I let the music speak I let the music speak

KNOWING ME, KNOWING YOU

 No more carefree laughter Silence ever after Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye Knowing me, knowing you There is nothing we can do Knowing me, knowing you We just have to face it, this time we're through (This time we're through, this time we're through This time we're through, we're really through) Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go (I have to go this time I have to go, this time I know) Knowing me, knowing you It's the best I can do Mem'ries (mem'ries), good days (good days), bad days (bad days) They'll be (they'll be), with me (with me) always (always) In these old familiar rooms children would play Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say Knowing me, knowing you There is nothing we can do Knowing me, knowing you We just have to face it, this time we're through (This time we're through, this time we're through This time we're through, we're really through) Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go (I have to go this time I have to go, this time I know) Knowing me, knowing you It's the best I can do

LAY ALL YOUR LOVE ON ME

 I wasn't jealous before we met Now every woman I see is a potential threat And I'm possessive, it isn't nice You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice But now it isn't true Now everything is new And all I've learned has overturned I beg of you Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me It was like shooting a sitting duck A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck I still don't know what you've done with me A grown up woman should never fall so easily I feel a kind of fear When I don't have you near Unsatisfied, I skip my pride I beg you dear Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me Don't go sharing your devotion Lay all your love on me I've had a few little love affairs They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce I used to think that was sensible It makes the truth even more incomprehensible 'Cause everything is new And everything is you And all I've learned has overturned What can I do Don't go wasting your emotion Lay all your love on me Don't go sharing your devotion Lay all your love on me

LIKE AN ANGEL PASSING THROUGH MY ROOM

 Long awaited darkness falls Casting shadows on the walls In the twilight hour I am alone Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face In this peaceful solitude All the outside world subdued Everything comes back to me again In the gloom Like an angel passing through my room Half awake and half in dreams Seeing long forgotten scenes So the present runs into the past Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind Like the embers as they die Love was one prolonged good bye And it all comes back to me tonight In the gloom Like an angel passing through my room I close my eyes And my twilight images go by All too soon Like an angel passing through my room

SHE'S MY KIND OF GIRL

 Look at her face, it's a wonderful face And it means something special to me Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me How lucky can one fellow be She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine Who could ever believe that she could be mine She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do And when we go for a walk in the park Then she holds me and squeezes my hand We'll go on walking for hours and talking About all the things that we plan She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine Who could ever believe that she would be mine She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do

SHOULD I LAUGH OR CRY

 He stands towering over me beside my bed Losing his head Tells me I must take him seriously Droning on the usual way He's such a clever guy And I wonder should I laugh or cry He's (he's) dressed (dressed) in the striped pajamas that I bought Trousers too short Gives (gives) me (me) all his small philosophy Carries on the way he does And me I get so tired And I wonder should I laugh or cry High and mighty his banner flies A fool's pride in his eyes Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is) All I see is a big balloon Halfway up to the moon He's wrapped up in a warm and safe cocoon Of an eternal lie So should I laugh or cry Strange (strange) how (how) dangerously indifferent I have grown Cold as a stone No (no) more (more) pain where there was pain before Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry And I wonder should I laugh or cry High and mighty his banner flies A fool's pride in his eyes Standing there on his toes to grow in size (All I see is) All I see is a big balloon Halfway up to the moon He's wrapped up in a warm and safe cocoon Of an eternal lie So should I laugh or cry

SITTING IN THE PALMTREE

 See me sitting in the palmtree Looking down at people passing by Sitting here no one can harm me They just stare at me and wonder why No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here Whatever happens, I won't let no one near Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now And in the evening, when the sun goes down I'll be the bluest of men in this town 'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind See me sitting in the palmtree Waiting for those little words from you People laugh and point their fingers Like I was a monkey at the zoo But I will stay here, among my coconuts So you will know dear, you're everything I've got Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in her window Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please See me sitting in the palmtree Getting angry at the silly crowd No one else but you can calm me You should know by now I'm far too proud I need to show you, I've got my feelings too You shouldn't treat me like you always do So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now And in the evening, when the sun goes down I'll be the bluest of men in this town 'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind Jeanie Jeanie, oh so fine Jeanie Jeanie on my mind Jeanie Jeanie, oh so fine Jeanie Jeanie on my mind Jeanie Jeanie, oh so fine

SLIPPING THROUGH MY FINGERS

 Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning Waving goodbye with an absent minded smile I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness And I have to sit down for a while The feeling that I'm losing her forever And without really entering her world I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter That funny little girl Slipping through my fingers all the time I try to capture every minute The feeling in it Slipping through my fingers all the time Do I really see what's in her mind Each time I think I'm close to knowing She keeps on growing Slipping through my fingers all the time Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table Barely awake, I let precious time go by Then when she's gone there's that odd melancholy feeling And a sense of guilt I can't deny What happened to the wonderful adventures The places I had planned for us to go (Slipping through my fingers all the time) Well, some of that we did but most we didn't And why I just don't know Slipping through my fingers all the time I try to capture every minute The feeling in it Slipping through my fingers all the time Do I really see what's in her mind Each time I think I'm close to knowing She keeps on growing Slipping through my fingers all the time Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture And save it from the funny tricks of time Slipping through my fingers Slipping through my fingers all the time Schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning Waving goodbye with an absent minded smile

 Do I hear what I think I'm hearing do i see the signs I think I see or is this just fantasy is it true that the beast is waking stirring in his restless sleep tonight in the pale moonlight in the grip of this cold December you and I have reason to remember Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing the songs that you and I don't sing they blow their horns and march along they drum their drums and look so strong you'd think that nothing in the world was wrong Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing the songs that you and I won't sing let's not look the other way taking a chance cause if the bugler starts to play we too must dance What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble won't somebody tell me what I hear in the distance but drawing near is it only a storm approaching all that thunder and the blinding light in the winter night In the grip of this cold December you and I have reason to remember Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing the songs that you and I don't sing they blow their horns and march along they drum their drums and look so strong you'd think that nothing in the world was wrong Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing the songs that you and I won't sing let's not look the other way taking a chance cause if the bugler starts to play we too must dance

 Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind Whatever happened to our love I wish I understood It used to be so nice, it used to be so good So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me SOS The love you gave me, nothing else can save me SOS When you're gone How can I even try to go on When you're gone Though I try how can I carry on You seemed so far away though you were standing near You made me feel alive, but something died I fear I really tried to make it out I wish I understood What happened to our love, it used to be so good So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me SOS The love you gave me, nothing else can save me SOS When you're gone How can I even try to go on When you're gone Though I try how can I carry on So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me SOS And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me SOS When you're gone How can I even try to go on When you're gone Though I try how can I carry on When you're gone How can I even try to go on When you're gone Though I try how can I carry on

SUMMER NIGHT CITY

 In the night a new day dawning And the first birds start to sing In the pale light of the morning Nothing's worth remembering It's a dream, it's out of reach Scattered driftwood on a beach Summer night city Summer night city Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark Summer night city Walking in the moonlight, love making in a park Summer night city In the sun I feel like sleeping I can't take it for too long My impatience slowly creeping Up my spine and growing strong I know what's waiting there for me Tonight I'm loose and fancy free When the night comes with the action I just know it's time to go Can't resist the strange attraction From that giant dynamo Lots to take and lots to give Time to breathe and time to live Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark Summer night city Walking in the moonlight, love making in a park Summer night city It's elusive call it glitter Somehow something turns me on Some folks only see the litter We don't miss them when they're gone I love the feeling in the air My kind of people everywhere When the night comes with the action I just know it's time to go Can't resist the strange attraction From that giant dynamo And tomorrow, when it's dawning And the first birds start to sing In the pale light of the morning Nothing's worth remembering It's a dream, it's out of reach Scattered driftwood on a beach Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark Summer night city Walking in the moonlight, love making in a park Summer night city

THE DAY BEFORE YOU CAME

 I must have left my house at eight, because I always do My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due I must have read the morning paper going into town And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so The usual place, the usual bunch And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained The day before you came I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two And at the time I never even noticed I was blue I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school The train back home again Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame The day before you came I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then I must have read a while The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim The day before you came And turning out the light I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain The day before you came

 I've seen you twice, in a short time Only a week since we started It seems to me, for every time I'm getting more open hearted I was an impossible case No one ever could reach me But I think I can see in your face There's a lot you can teach me So I wanna know What's the name of the game Does it mean anything to you What's the name of the game Can you feel it the way I do Tell me please, 'cause I have to know I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow And you make me talk And you make me feel And you make me show What I'm trying to conceal If I trust in you, would you let me down Would you laugh at me If I said I care for you Could you feel the same way too I wanna know What's the name of the game I have no friends, no one to see And I am never invited Now I am here, talking to you No wonder I get excited Your smile, and the sound of your voice And the way you see through me Got a feeling, you give me no choice But it means a lot to me So I wanna know What's the name of the game (Your smile and the sound of your voice) Does it mean anything to you (Got a feeling you give me no choice) But it means a lot, what's the name of the game (Your smile and the sound of your voice) Can you feel it the way I do Tell me please, 'cause I have to know I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow And you make me talk And you make me feel And you make me show What I'm trying to conceal If I trust in you, would you let me down Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you Could you feel the same way too I wanna know Oh yes I wanna know The name of the game (I was an impossible case) Does it mean anything to you (But I think I can see in your face) That it means a lot What's the name of the game (Your smile and the sound of your voice) Can you feel it the way I do (Got a feeling you give me no choice) But it means a lot, what's the name of the game (I was an impossible case) Does it mean anything to you (But I think I can see in your face) That it means a lot

THE PIPER

 They came from the hills And they came from the valleys and the plains They struggled in the cold In the heat and the snow and in the rain Came to hear him play Play their minds away We're all following a strange melody We're all summoned by a tune We're following the piper And we dance beneath the moon We're following the piper And we dance beneath the moon for him And we dance beneath the moon Sub luna saltamus They came from the south From the west and the north and from the east They waited for the man Like a parish is waiting for the priest Longed to hear him play Play their minds away We're all following a strange melody We're all summoned by a tune We're following the piper And we dance beneath the moon We're following the piper And we dance beneath the moon for him And we dance beneath the moon Sub luna saltamus He gave them a dream He seduced everybody in the land The fire in his eyes And the fear was a weapon in his hand So they let him play Play their minds away We're all following a strange melody We're all summoned by a tune We're following the piper And we dance beneath the moon We're following the piper And we dance beneath the moon for him And we dance beneath the moon

THE VISITORS

 I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me The sound so ominously tearing through the silence I cannot move, I'm standing Numb and frozen Among the things I love so dearly The books, the paintings and the furniture Help me The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door knob None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient And they don't dare to come here Anymore now But how I loved our secret meetings We talked and talked in quiet voices Smiling Now I hear them moving Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm Crackin' up Voices growing louder, irritation building And I'm close to fainting Crackin' up They must know by now I'm in here trembling In a terror evergrowing Crackin' up My whole world is falling, going crazy There is no escaping now, I'm Crackin' up These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces And now they've come to take me Come to break me And yet it isn't unexpected I have been waiting for these visitors Help me Now I hear them moving Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm Crackin' up Voices growing louder, irritation building And I'm close to fainting Crackin' up They must know by now I'm in here trembling In a terror evergrowing Crackin' up My whole world is falling, going crazy There is no escaping now, I'm Crackin' up Now I hear them moving Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm Crackin' up Voices growing louder, irritation building And I'm close to fainting Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors) They must know by now I'm in here trembling In a terror evergrowing Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors) My whole world is falling, going crazy There is no escaping now, I'm Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors) Now I hear them moving Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors) Voices growing louder, irritation building And I'm close to fainting Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors) They must know by now I'm in here trembling In a terror evergrowing Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors) My whole world is falling, going crazy There is no escaping now, I'm Crackin' up

THE WAY OLD FRIENDS DO

 You and I can share the silence Finding comfort together The way old friends do And after fights and words of violence We make up with each other The way old friends do Times of joy and times of sorrow We will always see it through Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow We can face it together The way old friends do You and I can share the silence Finding comfort together The way old friends do And after fights and words of violence We make up with each other The way old friends do Times of joy and times of sorrow We will always see it through Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow We can face it together The way old friends do We can face it together The way old friends do

THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL

 I don't wanna talk About the things we've gone through Though it's hurting me Now it's history I've played all my cards And that's what you've done too Nothing more to say No more ace to play The winner takes it all The loser standing small Beside the victory That's her destiny I was in your arms Thinking I belonged there I figured it made sense Building me a fence Building me a home Thinking I'd be strong there But I was a fool Playing by the rules The gods may throw a dice Their minds as cold as ice And someone way down here Loses someone dear The winner takes it all The loser has to fall It's simple and it's plain Why should I complain But tell me does she kiss Like I used to kiss you Does it feel the same When she calls your name Somewhere deep inside You must know I miss you But what can I say Rules must be obeyed The judges will decide The likes of me abide Spectators of the show Always staying low The game is on again A lover or a friend A big thing or a small The winner takes it all I don't wanna talk If it makes you feel sad And I understand You've come to shake my hand I apologize If it makes you feel bad Seeing me so tense No self confidence But you see The winner takes it all The winner takes it all

TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE

 He had what you might call a trivial occupation he cleaned the platforms of the local railway station with no romance in his life sometimes he wished he had a wife He read the matrimonial advertising pages the cries for help from different people, different ages but they had nothing to say, at least not until the day, when something special he read, this is what it said If you dream, of the girl for you, then call us and get two for the price of one We're the answer, if you feel blue, so call us and get two for the price of one He called the number and a voice said Alice Whiting the voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting he was amazed at his luck, the purest streak of gold he'd struck He said, I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling why don't we meet for a chat, the three of us in my flat I can't forget what I read this is what it said If you dream, of the girl for you, then call us and get two for the price of one We're the answer, if you feel blue, so call us and get two for the price of one She said I'm sure we must be perfect for each other and if you doubt it you'll be certain when you meet my mother

UNDER ATTACK

 Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go My resistance running low And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so (You know that I'm nobody's fool) I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me I don't have a strategy It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be Under attack, I'm being taken About to crack, defences breaking Won't somebody please have a heart Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart Under attack, I'm taking cover He's on my track, my chasing lover Thinking nothing can stop him now Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how This is getting crazy, I should tell him so Really let my anger show Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no (I'm kind of certain that's the truth) Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well Something like a magic spell I hardly dare to think of what could happen, where I'd be if I fell Under attack, I'm being taken About to crack, defences breaking Won't somebody please have a heart Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart Under attack, I'm taking cover He's on my track, my chasing lover Thinking nothing can stop him now Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how Under attack, I'm being taken About to crack, defences breaking Won't somebody please have a heart Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart Under attack, I'm taking cover He's on my track, my chasing lover Thinking nothing can stop him now Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

WHAT ABOUT LIVINGSTONE

 Went to buy me a paper at the local news stand And then I heard them laugh and say Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now Hey, what's it good for anyway So I said Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may What about Livingstone What about all those men Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way Tell me, wasn't it worth the while Travelling up the Nile Putting themselves on test Didn't that help the rest Wasn't it worth it then What about Livingstone And all of those fellas at the local news stand Didn't know what to answer or what to say So I told them about him, that he was just like One of those spacemen in his way And if you laugh at them Then there's only a thing I can say What about Livingstone What about all those men Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way Tell me, wasn't it worth the while Travelling up the Nile Putting themselves on test Didn't that help the rest Wasn't it worth it then What about Livingstone (Didn't he do it, well didn't he) What about all those men (Didn't he do it, well didn't he) Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way Tell me, wasn't it worth the while (Didn't he do it, well didn't he) Travelling up the Nile (Didn't he do it) Putting themselves on test Didn't that help the rest (Didn't that help them, well, didn't it) Wasn't it worth it then What about Livingstone (Didn't he do it, well didn't he) What about all those men (Didn't he do it, well didn't he)

WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE

 Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill Birds of passage, you and me We fly instinctively When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex We're still striving for the sky No taste for humble pie Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more Clear headed and open eyed With nothing left untried Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run There's no hurry any more when all is said and done Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

WHEN I KISSED THE TEACHER

 Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher All my friends at school They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool Nearly petrified 'cos he was taken by surprise When I kissed the teacher Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher My whole class went wild As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher One of these days Gonna tell him I dream of him every night One of these days Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher One of these days Gonna tell him I dream of him every night One of these days Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher My whole class went wild As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher (I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher (I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher (I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher (I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher (I wanna hug, hug, hug him)

WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE ME

 When you were lonely, you needed a man Someone to lean on, well I understand It's only natural But why did it have to be me Nights can be empty, nights can be cold So you were looking for someone to hold That's only natural But why did it have to be me I was so lonesome, I was blue I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I Always thought you knew the reason why I only wanted a little love affair Now I can see you are beginning to care But baby, believe me It's better to forget me Men are toys in the game that you play When you get tired, you throw them away That's only natural But why did it have to be me Falling in love with a woman like you Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do It's only natural But why did it have to be me I was so lonesome, I was blue I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I Always thought you knew the reason why I only wanted a little love affair Now I can see you are beginning to care But baby, believe me It's better to forget me
