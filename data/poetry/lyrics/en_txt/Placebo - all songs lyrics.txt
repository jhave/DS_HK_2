Sometimes it's faded 
Assassinated 
For fear of growing old 
Can't stop growing old... 
 


 

PLACEBO
WAITING FOR THE SON OF MAN

 Patience comes to the ugly, not me 
laughter comes to the lucky, not me 
people in my head that won't stop talking 
nothing in my dream that isn't creepy crawling 
 
Walking in the park and I think that i'm falling 
swimming in the sea and I think i'll 
you guessed it 
only lifeguards 
only lifeguards 
packing all the time ??

waiting 
waiting

Patience comes to the ugly, not me 
concentration comes to the ugly, not me 
nothing on the box that hasn't been born 
no one in the street that isn't old 
 
Driving in the car and I think that i'm crashing 
swimming in the Sea and I think that i'll 
you guessed it 
only lifeguards 
only lifeguards 
packing all the time

PLACEBO
WHERE IS MY MIND

 With your feet in the air and your head on the ground 
You try this trick and spin it, yeah 
Your head will collapse 
And there's nothing in it 
And you'll ask yourself 
 
Where is my mind X3 
 
Way out in the water 
See it swimmin' 
 
With your feet in the air and your head on the ground 
Try this trick and spin it, yeah 
Your head will collapse 
If there's nothing in it 
And you'll ask yourself 
 
Where is my mind X3 
 
Ahhhh, Ahhhh... 
 


 

PLACEBO
WITHOUT  YOU I''M NOTHING

Strange  infatuation seems to grace the evening tide.
  I''ll take it by your side.
  Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide.
  I''ll take it by your side.
  Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies.
  I''ll take it by your side.
  Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide.
  I''ll take it by your side.
  
  tick  tock x3
  tick  tick  tick  tick  tick  tock
  
  I''m unclean, a libertine
  And every time you vent your spleen,
  I seem to lose the power of speech,
  Your slipping slowly from my reach.
  You grow me like an evergreen,
  You never see the lonely me at all
  
  I...
  Take the plan, spin it sideways.
  I...
  Fall.
  Without you, I''m Nothing.
  Without you, I''m nothing.
  Without you, I''m nothing.
  Take the plan, spin it sideways.
  Without you, I''m nothing at all.
