ALL THE YOUNG PUNKS (NEW BOOTS AND CONTRACTS)

 (Strummer/Jones) 
Hanging About Down The Market Street 
 
I Spent A Lot Of Time On My Feet 
When I Saw Some Passing Yabbos 
We Did Chance To Speak 
 
I Knew How To Sing 
Y' Know An 
They Knew How To Pose 
An' One Of Them Had A Les Paul 
Heart Attack Machine

Laugh Your Life 
Cos There Ain't Much To Cry For 
All The Young Cunts 
Live It Now 
Cos There Ain't Much To Die For 
 
Everybody Wants To Bum 
A Ride On The Rock 'N' Roller Coaster 
And We Went Out 
Got Our Name In Small Print On The Poster 
Of Course We Got A Manger 
Though He Ain't The Mafia 
A Contract Is A Contract 
When They Get 'Em Out On Yer 
 
You Gotta Drag Yourself To Work 
Drag Yourself To Sleep 
You're Dead From The Neck Up 
By The Middle Of The Week 
 
Face Front You Got The Future Shining 
Like A Piece Of Gold 
But I Swear As We Get Closer 
It Look More Like A Lump Of Coal 
But It's Better Than Some Factory 
Now That's No Place To Waste Your Youth 
I Worked There For A Week Once 
I Luckily Got The Boot

Are you ready for

View the Earth

Europe switches off those lights 
 
Are you ready for

War, wall to wall with the regimental 
War, with all the things continental 
Are you red 
 
War

There's no use runnin' a mobile home 
Everywhere is a target zone 
Hell is ringing on the red, red phone 
 
Are you ready for 
 
War, all that is futuristic 
War, all that is realistic 
War, all that will be ballistic 
Are you red 
 
War 
War

Are you ready for 
Are you ready for 
 
Vodka chilled in the Kremlin bar 
Ride on the rocky (???) and hold my arm 
Raise my glass and break it on the bar

CLASH (THE)
ATOM TAN

 (The Clash) 
 
Now the corporations stopped! 
Stopped pushing fast food 
Been a multiple shooting 
Downtown at the bank 
Reluctantly the panic begins 
To catch fire 
But it did not affect 
The steady sale of jun 
The state office looked 
It looked like Hollywood 
With make up bleeding all over the cracks 
Wo he blew his lines 
Facing the cameras 
He suffered the first 
 
CHORUS 
All live heart attack 
Oh you've caught an even atom tan 
 
The motor cyanide 
Cyanide suicide 
He finally found the brick wall in his life 
Shining up his engine 
He dressed right up for it 
At the top of the speedo 
He crumpled the bike 
There's plenty people runnin' runnin' for cover 
Hoping at best to hold off al the rest 
Once last stand at the bunker fire 
Machine gun and pitchfork and breast 
 
CHORUS 
 
But it isn't so easy 
So easy for lovers 
Chained in love 
Stained at the top of the tower 
The pink hearse is leaving at funeral speed 
Driving your heart 
Away with the flowers 
All night I waited 
I waited for a horseman 
His ever faithful 
His Indian friend 
I'm not the only one 
Of the caped crusader fan club watching the sky 
For mankind's friend 
 
CHORUS 
 
Oh you've caught an even atom tan 
Calamine

BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN LYING BACK

A LIFETIME SERVING ONE MACHINE 
IS TEN TIMES WORSE THAN PRISON 
 
IMAGINE IF ALL THE BOYS IN JAIL 
COULD GET OUT NOW TOGETHER 
WHADDA YOU THINK THEY'D WANT TO SAY TO US? 
WHILE WE WAS BEING CLEVER 
 
SOMEDAY YOU'LL MEET YOUR ROCKING CHAIR 
COS THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SPINNING 
THERE'S NO POINT TO WANNA COMB YOUR HAIR 
WHEN IT'S GREY AND THINNING 
 
RUN RABBIT RUN 
STRIKE OUT BOYS, FOR THE HILLS

 It ain't my fault 
It's 6 'o'clock in the morning 
He said 
As he came up out of the night 
 
When he found I had no coins to bum, 
He began to testify 
Born in a depression 
Born out of good luck 
Born into misery 
 In the back of a truck.. 
 
I'm telling you this mister 
Don't be put off by looks 
I been in the ring and I took those right hooks 
 
Oh the loneliness 
Used to knock me out harder than the rest 
 
And I've worked for breakfast 
'N I ain't had no lunch 
I been on delivery and received every punch 
 
Suddenly I noticed that it weren't quite the same 
Feel different one morning maybe it was the rain 
 
But everywhere I looked all over the city 
They're runnin' in an out of the bars 
Someone stopped for a pick up driving one of those cars 
Y'see I allways wanted one of those cars 
Long black 'n shiny an' pull up to the bars 
Honk your horn, put down your windows, push yer button, 
Hear it coming in 
You can say I can see the light... roll! 
Forward! Drive! Green lights! Green lights! 
Intersection city coming a running comeback home I run back 
Not that strong now 
Yes who's there now, can I help you? Calling Intel station light 
 
Did you put your money in? Yes I put it in 
It say go, I say go, she say go, so we say go 
Cos I can see the light all night tonight this night right now 
Coming on forward motion across the ocean 
An' up the hills yeh boys let's strike for the hills 
While that petrol tank is full 
Gimme a push gimme a pull 
Gimme a llama gimme a mule 
Gimme a donkey or gimme a horse 
 
Down the avenue 
So fine 
In style

It's up to you not to heed the call up 
I don't wanna die! 
It's up to you not to hear the call up 
I don't wanna kill! 
 
For he who will die 
Is he who will kill 
 
Maybe I wanna see the wheatfields 
Over Kiev and down to the sea 
 
All the young people down the ages 
They gladly marched off to die 
Proud city fathers used to watch them 
Tears in their eyes 
 
There is a rose that I want to live for 
Although, God knows, I may not have met her 
There is a dance an' I should be with her 
There is a town unlike any other 
 
It's up to you not to hear the call up

CAR JAMMING

 (The Clash) 
 
Tonight they're closing up the world 
N' sweeping smoke from cigarettes 
And what is that funk multi national 
Anthem rocking from a thousand 
King Kong cassette decks 
Then a shyboy from Missouri 
Boots blown off in a '60s war 
Riding aluminium crutches 
Now he knows the welfare kindness n' 
Agent Orange color blindness 
As we works from door to door 
The violence in the carpets 
The mirror of his wife 
Drives the slum bum dweller 
To grind his hunting knife 
In homesteads of cigar box radios 
Hive like bees 
The body in the ice 
Box has no date for freeeeeze 
 
CHORUS 
In a car jam 
 
Selling is what selling sells 
But only saints of the 7 avenues can sell 
The hells 
Fanning the drug afflicted leperizing acne 
Once inisde the executive 
He never leaves his home 
Gorillas drag their victiims 
Hyenas try to sue 
Snakes find grass in concrete 
There is no city zoo by 
Ventilation units where towers 
Meet the streets 
The ragged stand in bags 
Soaking heat up through their feet 
 
This was the donly kindness 
And it was accidental too 
 
CHORUS 
 
Now shaking single engined planes 
Traffik king stereos from Cuba 
Buzzed the holy zealot mass 
 
And drowned out Missa Luba 
And drowned out Missa Luba 
I thought I saw Lauren Bacall

CLASH (THE)
CARD CHEAT, THE

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
There's a solitary man crying, Hold me. 
It's only because he's a lonely 
If the keeper of time runs slowly 
He won't be alive for long! 
 
If he only had time to tell of all of the things he planned 
With a card up his sleeve, what would he achieve? 
It means nothing! 
 
To the opium den and the barroom gin 
In the Belmont chair playing violins 
The gambler's face cracks into a grin 
As he lays down the king of spades 
 
But the dealer just stares 
There's something wrong here, he thinks 
The gambler is seized and forced to his knees 
And shot dead 
 
He only wanted more time 
Away from the darkest door 
But his luck it gave in 
As the dawn light crept in 
And he lay on the floor 
 
From the Hundred Year War to the Crimea 
With a lance and a musket and a Roman spear 
To all of the men who have stood with no fear 
In the service of the King 
 
Before you met your fate be sure you 
Did not forsake your lover 
May not be around anymore

 (The Clash) 
 
CHORUS 
Charlie don't surf and we think he should 
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good 
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger Momma 
Charlie's gonna be a napalm star 
 
Everybody wants to rule the world 
Must be something we get from birth 
One truth is we never learn 
Satellites will make space burn 
 
We've been told to keep the strangers out 
We don't like them starting to hang around 
We don't like them all over town 
Across the world we are going to blow them down 
 
CHORUS 
 
The reign of the super powers must be over 
So many armies can't free the earth 
Soon the rock will roll over 
Africa is choking on their Coca Cola 
 
It's a one a way street in a one horse town 
One way people starting to brag around 
You can laugh, put them down 
These one way people gonna blow us down 
 
CHORUS 
 
Charlie don't surf he'll never learn 
Charlie don't surf though he's got a gun 
Charlie don't surf think that he should 
Charlie don't surf we really think he should 
Charlie don't surf 
 
Charlie don't surf and we think he should 
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good 
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger Momma

An' He Has Been A Scrubber Up 
An' I Seen Him A Picking Up 
Dog Ends In The Rain 
An' He Has Never Read A Book 
Though I Told Him To Take A Look 
He Lifted His Poolhall Cue 
For Another Game 
But It Ain't No Modern Miracle 
That We Found The Golden Rule 
What You Can't Buy You Gotta Steal 
An' What You Say Can't Steal You Better Leave 
 
I Don't Like To Hang About 
In This Lonely Room 
'Cos London Is For Going Out 
And Trying To Hear A Tune 
But People Come Pouncing Up To Me 
And Say What Are You Doing Here 
You're Supposed To Be A Star 
Not A Cheapskate Bleeding Queer 
 
Like A Load Of Rats From A Sinking Ship 
You Slag Us Down To Save Your Hip 
But You Don't Give Me The Benfit 
Of Your Doubt 
'Cos I'll Bite It Off And Spit It Out 
 
We're Cheapskates Anything'll Do 
We're Cheapskates What Are We Supposed To Do? 
An' We Can Rock 
Hey Hey Let's Roll 
An' We Can Walk

Just Because We're In A Group 
You Think We're Stinking Rich 
'N We All Got Model Girls 
Shedding Every Stitch 
'N You Think The Cocaine's Flowing 
Like A River Up Our Noses 
'N Every Sea Will Part For Us 
Like The Red One Did For Moses 
 
Well I Hope You Make It One Day 
Just Like You Always Said You Would Some Day 
And I'll Get Out My Money And Make A Bet 
That I'll Be Seein' You Down The Launderette

What are we gonna do now? 
Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew? 
'Cause they're working for the clampdown 
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you! 
When we're working for the clampdown 
We will teach our twisted speech 
To the young believers 
We will train our blue eyed men 
To be young believers 
 
The judge said five to ten but I say double that again 
I'm not working for the clampdown 
No man born with a living soul 
Can be working for the clampdown 
Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall 
How can you refuse it? 
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power 
D'you know that you can use it? 
 
The voices in your head are calling 
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming 
Only a fool would think someone could save you 
The men at the factory are old and cunning 
You don't owe nothing, so boy get runnin' 
It's the best years of your life they want to steal 
 
You grow up and you calm down 
You're working for the clampdown 
You start wearing the blue and brown 
You're working for the clampdown 
So you got someone to boss around 
It makes you feel big now 
You drift until you brutalize 
You made your first kill now 
 
In these days of evil presidentes 
Working for the clampdown 
But lately one or two has fully paid their due 
For working for the clampdown 
But ha! Gitalong! Gitalong! 
 
And I've given away no secrets 
Who's barmy now?

CLASH CITY ROCKERS

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
An' I wanna move the town to the clash city 
rockers 
You need a little jump of electrical shockers 
You better leave town if you only wanna knock us 
Nothing stands the pressure of the clash city rockers 
 
You see the rate they come down the escalator 
Now listen to the tube train accelerator 
Then you realise that you got to have a purpose 
Or this place is gonna knock you out sooner or later 
 
So don't complain about your useless employment 
Jack it in forever tonight 
Or shut your mouth and pretend you enjoy it 
Think of all the money you've got 
 
An' I wanna liquefy everybody gone dry 
Or plug into the aerials that poke up in the sky 
Or burn down the suburbs with the half closed eyes 
You won't succeed unless you try 
 
You owe me a move say the bells of St. Groove 
Come on and show me say the bells of Old Bowie 
When I am fitter say the bells of Gary Glitter 
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince Far I 
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince Far I 
 
An' I wanna move the town to the clash city rockers 
You need a little jump of electrical shockers 
You better leave town if you only wanna knock us 
Nothing stands the pressure of the clash city rockers

CLASH (THE)
COMPLETE CONTROL

 (Strummer/Jones) 
They said release 'Remote Control' 
But we didn't want it on the label 
They said, Fly to Amsterdam 
The people laughed but the press went mad 
 
Ooh ooh ooh someone's really smart 
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, that's a laugh 
 
On the last tour my mates couldn't get in 
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again 
At every hotel we was met by the Law 
Come for the party come to make sure! 
 
Ooh ooh ooh have we done something wrong? 
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, even over this song 
 
They said we'd be artistically free 
When we signed that bit of paper 
They meant let's make a lotsa mon ee 
An' worry about it later 
 
Ooh ooh ooh I'll never understand 
Ooh ooh ooh complete control lemme see your other hand! 
 
All over the news spread fast 
They're dirty, they're filthy 
They ain't gonna last! 
 
This is Joe Public speaking 
I'm controlled in the body, controlled in the mind 
 
Total 
C o n control that means you!

CLASH (THE)
COOL CONFUSION

 (The Clash) 
 
BETWEEN COOL CONFUSION 
AND KUNG FU IN THE CAR PARK 
COULD THE WEEKEND BE LOSING 
THAT REACTIVE SPARK 
 
EVEN IN THE SHEBEEN 
OR DOWN IN THE MEAT RACK 
LONGTIME I FEEL COLD 
TO SEND CINDERELLA'S SHOE BACK 
 
ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE WIRE 
PARTY JAM ON THE LINE 
I CAN'T HEAR A THING 
CAN'T GET NO NUMBER NINE 
 
NOW WE MUST GET IN TOUCH 
IF THE NIGHT IS TO BURN 
SOMEONE OUT THERE IN LUCK 
LEND ME YOUR STAR FOR A TURN 
 
AS HEROES FIX THEIR HAIR 
SOME ARE SAVING THEIR BREATH 
JUST ON THE WALKWAYS TONIGHT 
FOR A GLUE BAG DEATH 
 
SCREENS FLICK IN UNISON 
SOME GAZE AT THE SOUL 
FROM THE TIERS AND THE HEIGHTS 
GO FOR THE FIFTEENTH FLOOR STROLL 
 
IT'S IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS; 
ANYBODY STAR GILT 
WOULD HAVE LEFT THIS CLUB 
WAY BEFORE IT WAS BUILT 
 
THIS STRIKES YOU SO LATE 
AS THE GUY WITH THE BROOM 
SWEEPS YOU AND THE BOTTLES 
RIGHT OUT OF THE ROOM 
 
NOW I WASH IN THE FACTORY 
CONFESS IN THE TILE HOUSE 
I DON'T NEED TO BLEED ANYBODY 
TO STRIKE OUT 
 
TODAY MY GODFATHER 
HE SENT A NOTE FROM THE JAIL 
SAID GO GET 'EM KID 
BUT DON'T GET CHAINED TO THE RAIL 
 
BETWEEN COOL CONFUSION 
AND KUNG FU IN THE CAR PARK 
COULD THE WEEKEND BE LOSING

CLASH (THE)
COOL UNDER HEAT

 (Strummer/Rhodes) 
 
Rebels on the corner 
Rebels to the core 
Got a million dollar question 
What is livin' for? 
 
Hey! Man can scratch a livin' 
In a fat man's city class 
The teacher is survival 
But soon the present will be the past 
 
So! 
Be cool under heat 
Be cool under heat 
Be cool on the street 
Be cool under heat 
 
When you're rockin' down 
On a cold hard night 
Pitiless eyes of the cityless souls 
Narrow in the lights 
 
Sorrow upon sorrow 
Go ganging up in your head 
You can leave it till tomorrow 
If you can balance on the edge 
 
Hey! 
Be cool under heat 
Be cool under heat 
Be cool on the street 
Be cool under heat 
 
When the baby and you got to fight 
Go cool your love in the rain 
When the match refuses to strike 
Show that you really are in pain 
 
I'm giving you a warning 
Gonna burn those blue suede shoes 
Swagger in the mornin' 
Prints up front page news 
 
Be cool under heat 
Be cool under heat 
Be cool on the street 
Be cool under heat 


 

CLASH (THE)
CORNER SOUL

 (The Clash) 
 
Is the music of grove skin rock 
Soaked in the diesel of was boys war? 
Blood, black gold and the face of a judge 
Is the music calling for a river of blood? 
 
Beat the drums tonight, Alphonso 
Spread the news all over the grove 
The big meeting has decided 
That total was must burn on the grove 
 
Does it mean I should take my machete 
To chop my way through the path of life? 
Does it mean I should run with the dog pack 
Is that the way to be the one to survive? 
 
Never need a gun says Tai Chi 
Move on up to dragon snaps his tail 
Fall back on still waters 
Hammer with his eye on the nail 
 
Spread the word tonight please, Sammy 
They're searching everyhouse on the grove 
Don't go alone now, Sammy! 
The wind has blown away the corner soul 
 
Tell the news for me, Sammy 
They're searching every place on the grove 
But don't go down alone new, Sammy! 
The wind has blown away the croner soul 
 
Is the music calling for a river of blood? 


 

CLASH (THE)
CROOKED BEAT, THE

 (The Clash) 
 
Start the car lets make a midnight run 
Across the river to South London 
To dance to the latest hi fi sound 
Of bass, guitar and drum 
Seeking out a rhythm that can take the pressure off 
Stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat 
 
Take a piece of cloth, a coin for thirst 
For the sweat will start to run 
With a cymbal splash, a word of truth 
And a rocking bass and drum 
Seeking out a rhythm that can take the pressure on 
Stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat 
 
So one by one they come on down 
From the tower blocks of my home town 
Stepping with the rhythm of the rockers beat 
Drowning out the pressure of the crooked beat 
Seeking out a rhythm that can take the tension on 
Stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat 
 
It has crooked past this crooked street 
Where cars patrol this crooked beat 
Badges flsh and sirens wail 
They'll be taking one and all to jail 
 
Prance! Prance! You want a law to dance? 


 

CLASH (THE)
DEATH IS A STAR

 (The Clash) 
 
And I was gripped by that deadly phantom 
I followed him through hard jungles 
As he stalked through the back lots 
Strangling through the night shades 
 
The thief of life 
Moved onwards and outwards to love 
 
In a one stop only motel 
A storm bangs on the cheapest room 
The phantom slips in to spill blood 
Even on the sweetest honeymoon 
 
The killer of love 
Caught the last late Niagara bus 
 
By chance or escaping from misery 
Bu suddeness or in answer to pain 
Smoking in the dark cinema 
You could see the bad go down again 
 
And the clouds are high in Spanish mountains 
And a Ford roars through the night full of rain. 
 
The killer's blood flows 
But he loads his gun again 
 
Make a grown man cry like a girl 
To see the guns dying at sunset 
 
In vain lovers claimed 
But they never had met. 


 

CLASH (THE)
DEATH OR GLORY

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
Every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the 
world 
And ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl 
Love 'n' hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands 
The hands that slap his kids around 'cause they don't understand 
 
How death or glory becomes just another story 
How death or glory becomes just another story 
'N' every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock 'n' roll 
Grabs the mike to tell us he'll die before he's sold 
But i believe in this and it's been tested by research 
That he who fucks nun will later join the church 
 
From every dingy basement on every dingy street 
I hear every dragging handclap over every dragging beat 
That's just the beat of time the beat that must go on 
If you been trying for years then we already heard your song

DICTATOR

 (Strummer/Rhodes) 
 
Yes I am the dictator the more guns I got the better 
Yes I am the liquidator I carry the old Beretta 
You know there once was freedom 
You know how dangerous that can be 
The people used to dance & sing 
& they used to run wild in the streets 
But now I am the voice 
Howling from your radio 
From my armour plated Cadillac 
You'll hear what I say goes 
 
Yes I am the dictator I satisfy the U.S. team 
I always do my killing in the woods & keep the city gutters clean 
Cos I need a few more dollars 
For my fighter pilot to be free 
To dive bomb on the population 
If they go running wild in the streets 
Yes I am that voice...etc 
 
Yes I am the crusador I spent twenty years in exile 
But now I am the invader & I'm never never gonna die 
Yes I am the dictator my name is on your ballot sheet 
But until my box has your cross you know the form is incomplete 
And you know........etc

She's gonna waste herself away 
When your daddy smashed that TV screen 
I understand what he had to say 
 
I'm going to get me a big, big, big 
Big, Big car 
Then I'm gonna drive, drive, drive 
I'm gonna drive so far 
Up your boulevard

So far up your boulevard 
 
Gonna be a dirty punk 
While my brother dresses clean 
He used to be the local hunk 
The girls all ride in my machine(?) 
 
How bout the time I made him drunk 
And he insult my brotherhood 
I shout out I am a dirty punk 
Gonna rock your neighbohood 
 
I'm going to get a big, big, big 
Big, Big car 
Then I'm gonna drive, drive, drive

AN' WHO GOT CAUGHT OUT ON THEIR UNAWARES? 
WHEN THAT NEW PARTY ARMY CAME MARCHING RIGHT UP THE STAIRS 
 
WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME AGAIN 
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN 
THE SUN IS SHINING AN' THE KIDS ARE SHOUTING LOUD 
BUT YOU GOTTA KNOW IT'S SHINING THROUGH A CRACK IN THE CLOUD 
AND THE SHADOWS KEEP FALLING WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME

EQUALISER, THE

 (The Clash) 
 
No! Gangboss no! 
We don't want the whip! 
 
As you get weaker it will get harder 
So don't be like him 
Keep your bones of effort and strngth 
Don't sell them to him 
 
We don't want no gangboss 
We want to equalize 
To my fathers fathers fathers father 
Work was no joy 
When his son had grown of age 
You got to work now boy 
Never ceasing for many years 
Want to follow that boy? 
 
Till half and half is equalized 
Put down the tools 
See the car see the house 
See the fabulous jewels 
See the world you have built it with shoulders of iron 
See the world but it is not yours say the stealers of Zion 
 
Geneva 
Wall Street 
Who makes them so fat? 
Well well me an' you better think about that 
In overdrive whooo 
 
Till humanize is equalize 
Put down the tools 
Every face on every side 
Throw down the tools 
Stay at home 
Don't check with Rome paint strike on the door 
It's one to one the fight is on so don't go to war 
 
We don't need no gangboss 
We have to equalize

EVERY LITTLE BIT HURTS

 (Ed Cobb) 
 
Every little bit hurts 
Every little bit hurts 
Every night I cry 
Every night I sigh 
Every night I wonder why 
You treat me cold 
But I can't let you go 
 
Every little (???) 
Every little (???) 
Say you're coming home 
But you never phone 
Leave me all alone 
My love is strong for you 
I do long for you 
 
I can't take this loneliness 
You're giving me 
Can't go on 
Giving my life away 
 
Come back to me 
Darling you'll see 
I can give all the things 
That you wanted before 
If you'll stay 
 
Every little bit hurts

Every night I cry 
Every night I sigh 
Every night I wonder why 
You hurt me 
Desert me 
 
I can't take this lonliness 
You're giving me 
I can't go on 
Giving my life away 
 
Come back to me 
Darling you'll see 
I can give all the things

FIRST NIGHT BACK IN LONDON

 (The Clash) 
 
The mini cab 
The driver is black 
This time of night 
You better sit in the back 
 
Got a few smokes 
Under your hat 
The cops are lookin' out 
For the petrol on the black 
 
This time I think 
So what the hell 
There's that female 
I know too well 
 
Why should I lean 
Get out my mind again 
I ridin' in the back alone 
The stranger rides again 
 
To see my lovely town 
That always brings you down 
Where every drifter drifts 
For many miles around 
 
We take a casual drive 
For two miles up the road 
The cops pull us over 
And search right through our clothes 
 
They give him hell 
They check him on the air 
I sit there with the drugs in my hair 
 
As soon as I get home 
I call Heathrow 
Want a standby fare to Borneo

FOUR HORSEMEN

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
Well they were given the grapes that go ripe in the sun 
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue 
But they told no one where they had begun four horsemen 
 
They were given al lthe foods of vanity 
And all the instant promises of immortality 
Buyt they bit the dust screamin' insanity! four horsemen 
 
One was over the edge, one was over the cliff 
One was lickin' em dry with a bloody great spliff 
When they picked up the hiker he didn't want the lift 
From the horsemen 
 
But you! 
You're not searching, are you now? 
You're not looking anyhow 
You're never gonna ride that lonely mile 
Or put yourself up on trial 
Oh, you told me how your life was so bad 
An' I agree that it does seem sad 
But that's the price that you gotta pay 
If you're lazing all around all day 
Four horsement coming right through 
Four horsemen and they're pissing by you 
They make you look like you're wearing a truss 
Four hosemen and it's gonna be us 
 
Well they gave useverything for bending the mind 
ANd we cleaned out their pockets and we drank 'em blind 
IT's a long way to the finish so don't get left behind 
By those horsemen 
 
And they gave us the grapes that went ripe in the sun 
That loosen the scews at the back of the tongue 
But we still told nothing 'bout what was to come 
Four horsemen

An' someone just asked me if the group would wear suits 
 
I don't wanna hear about what the rich are doing 
I don't wanna go to where the rich are going 
They think they're so clever, they think they're so right 
But the truth is only known by guttersnipes 
 
There's twenty two singers! But one microphone 
Back in the garage 
There's five guitar players! But one guitar

GATES OF THE WEST

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
I would love to be the lucky one on chill avenue 
Who could keep your heart warm when ice has turned it blue 
But with the beggin' sleeping losers as they turn in for the night 
I'm looking back for home and I can see the lights 
 
I should be jumpin' shoutin' that I made it all this way 
From Camden town station to 44th and 8th 
Not many make it this far and many say we're great 
But just like them we walk on an' we can't escape our fate 
Can't you hear the sighing 
Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue 
Both say they needed something new 
 
So I'm standing at the gates of the west 
I burn money at the lights of the sign 
The city casts a shadow of the perfect crime 
I'm standing at the gates of the east 
I take my pulse and the pulse of my friend 
The city casts a shadow, will I see you again? 
 
The immigrants an' remnants of all the glory years 
Are clustered around the bar again for another round of beers 
Little Richard's in the kitchen playing spoons and plates 
He's telling the waitress he's great 
 
Ah say i know somewhere back'n'forth in time 
Out on the dustbowls, deep in the roulette mine 
Or in a ghetto cellar only yesterday 
There's a move into the future for the USA. 
 
I hear them crying 
Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue 
Both said they needed something new 
 
Standing at the gates of the west 
In the shadow again 
I'm standing at the gates of the west 
In the shadow again

HATE AND WAR

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
Hate and war the only things we got today 
 
An' if I close my eyes 
They will not go away 
You have to deal with it 
It is the currency 
 
Hate...hate...hate... 
 
The hate of a nation 
A million miles from home 
An' get war from the junkies 
Who don't like my form 
 
I'm gonna stay in the city 
Even when the house fall down 
I don't dream of a holiday 
When hate an' war come around 
 
Hate and war... 
 
I have the will to survive 
I cheat if I can't win 
If someone locks me out 
I kick my back in 
 
An' if I get aggression 
I give it to them two time back 
Every day it's just the same 
With hate an' war on my back 
 
Hate and war I hate all the English 
Hate and war they're just as bad as wops 
Hate and war I hate all the politeness 
Hate and war I hate all the cops 
 
I wanna walk down any street 
Looking like a creep 
I don't care if I get beat up 
By any Kebab Greek

HATEFUL

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
Well, I got a friend who's a man 
What man? 
 The man who keeps me from the lovely 
He gives me what I need 
What you need? What you got? 
I need it all so badly 
 
CHORUS 
Oh, anything I want he gives it to me 
Anything I want he gives it, but not for free 
It's hateful 
And it's paid for and I'm so grateful to be nowhere 
 
This year I've lost some friends 
Some friends? What friends? 
I dunno, I ain't even noticed 
 
You see, I gotta go out again 
Again? My friend 
I gotta see that mainman 
 
I killed all my nerves 
My nerves? What swerves? 
And I can't drive so steady 
 
I've lost my memory 
My mind? Behind! 
I can't see so clearly

HITSVILLE U.K.

 (The Clash) 
 
They cried the tears, they shed the fears, 
Up and down the land, 
They stole guitars or used guitars 
 So the tape would understand, 
Without even the slightest hope of a 1000 sales 
Just as if, as if there was, a hitsville in U.K., 
I know the boy was all alone, til the hitsville hit U.K. 
 
They say true talent will allways emerge in time, 
When lightening hits small wonder 
Its fast rough factory trade, 
No expense accounts, or lunch discounts 
Or hypeing up the charts, 
The band went in, 'n knocked 'em dead, in 2 min. 59 
 
 No slimy deals, with smarmy eels in hitsville U.K. 
Lets shake'n say, we'll operate in hitsville U.K. 
The mutants, creeps and musclemen, 
Are shaking like a leaf, 
It blows a hole in the radio, 
When it hasnt sounded good all week, 
A mike'n boom, in your living room in hitsville U.K. 
No consumer trials, or A.O.R., in hitsville U.K., 
Now the boys and girls are not alone, 
Now the hitsville's hit U.K.

I'M NOT DOWN

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
If it's true that a rich man leads a sad life 
N' that's what they from day to day 
Then what do all the poor do with their lives? 
Have nothing to say on judgment day? 
 
I've been beat up, I've been thrown 
Out but I'm not down, I'm not down 
I've been shown up, but I've grown up 
And I'm not down, I'm not down 
 
On my own I faced a gang of jeering in strange streets 
When my nerves were pumping and I 
Fought my fear in, I did not run 
I was not done 
 
And I have lived that kind of day 
When one of your sorrows will go away 
It goes down and down and hit the floor 
Down and down and down some more 
Depression 
But I now there'll be some way 
When I can swing everything back my way 
Like skyscrapers rising up 
Floor by floor, I'm not giving up 
 
So you rock around and think that 
You're the toughest 
In the world, the whole wide world 
But you're streets away from where 
It gets the roughest 
You ain't been there

Are always on the TV 
'Cos killers in America

Never mind the stars and stripes 
Let's print the Watergate Tapes 
I'll salute the New Wave 
And I hope nobody escapes 
 
I'm so bored with the U...S...A...

IF MUSIC COULD TALK

 (The Clash/Dread) 
 
*Left Channel* 
Make sure! 
Taking cover in the bunker tonight 
Waiting for Bo Diddley's headlights 
I feel alright 
Gotta Fender Stratosphere 
I can do anything tonight 
It's in neon lights an' global rights 
Frank? He's on the phone 
There ain't no German girl outside 
But who cares when its warm inside? 
With music 
Special mystery of music tragically 
Exchanging slaves for majesties 
Modern waves of tragedy 
Packing a to pience colt pair of shoots 
A shiny grey mexican suit 
The blue eyed traffic can sashay by 
'Cos tonight the sailor boys have hit Shanghai 
The kick out traffic goes creaking by 
I smash my glass and shout shanghi 
My drummer friend comes shooting by 
He said Errol Flynn will never die 
Oh no! Who am I to question why? 
And are you lonesome tonight 
And do ya need a country cowboy 
Who's just thin and tight in those 
Brrrr bus depot jeans 
With a squirt resistant stud stud 
Hey stoner 
 
Get over there in the spliffbunker one 
Becos London Bridge was sold somehow 
But it was too old anyhow 
When Uncle Sam has broken down 
We'll make him down in old Japan 
Say yeee 
 
Well there ain't no better blend 
Than Joe Ely and his Texas Men 
Where the wind blows 
I ain't seen none like that scenery 
You can see from a bus if you pay the price 
 
Wave my arms around 
Flag one of those taxi's maybe 
I saw a girl somewhere somehow 
Forever sticks in my mind somehow 
I've just got three lines 
And a pair of two's 
Like a lucky roll of dice that you 
You cast 
 
*Right Channel* 
If music could talk! 
Which means 
Whatever your mind can bring 
Likethe apple fell off the tree 
Pah! Fell right on his head 
Yeah many years ago 
 
There was a man who said 
I am a shaman 
A voodoo shaman 
Got in trouble so he's going out 
Mixing up and Haiti! Oh! 
And the crickets 
Buddy Holly said it was 
Brrr Brrr yiii! 
 
If music could talk you know 
 
I feel kinda lonely 
Standing out on the floor 
Of Electric Ladyland... 
Cos this is a good question Samson 
Are you partly Arabic? 
 
Chi man! Whatcho all about 
 
I don't want to I can't hope to 
Say it all in one go 
Occasionally once or twice 
A day I feel alive enough to say 
Let's hear what the drummerman's 
Got to say about 
He said is it Errol Flynn's birthday or not? 
Sept 12 until October 
If they pack 2 piece 
Colt pair of shoots 
We got the shiny grey Mexican suits 
I'm just wasting a great big 
Corporation and the entire fund 
The girders of Wall Street 
And thetemples of money 
And the high priests 
Of the expense account 
And Im wasting the whole thing 
I come down in Yamaha ha 
They make the best pianos time to step up

The soldier boy for his soliders pay 
Obeys theeargent at arms whatever he says 
 
The seargent will for his seargent's pay 
Obeythe general order of the battle play 
 
The generals bow to the government 
Obey the charge you must not relent 
 
What of the neighbors and the prophets in bars? 
What are they saying in the publiz bazaar? 
We are tired of the tune 
You must not relent 
 
At every stroke of the bell in the tower there goes 
Another boy from another side 
 
The bulletins that steady come in say those 
Familiar words at the top of the hour 
 
The jamming city increases its hum 
And those terrible words continue to come 
 
Through bras music of government hear those 
Guns tattoo a roll on the drums 
 
No one mentions the neighboring war 
No one knows what they're fighting for 
We are tired of the tune 
You must not relent

IVAN MEETS G.I. JOE

 (The Clash) 
 
So you're on the floor, at 54 
Think you can last at the Palace 
Does your body go to the to and fro? 
But tonight's the night or didn't you know 
That Ivan meets G.I. Joe 
 
He tried his tricks that Ruskie bear 
The United Nations said it's all fair 
He did the radiation the chemical plague 
But he could not win with a cossack spin 
 
The Vostok Bomb the Stalin strike 
He tried every move he tried to hitch hike 
He drilled a hole like a Russian star 
He made every move in his repertoire 
 
When Ivan meet G.I. Joe 
 
Now it was G.I. Joe's turn to blow 
He turned it on cool and slow 
He tried a payphone call to the Pentagon 
A radar scan a leviathan 
 
He wiped the Earth clean as a plate 
What does it take to make a Ruskie break? 
But the crowd are bored and off they go 
Over the road to watch China blow! 
 
When Ivan meets G.I. Joe

JUNCO PARTNER

 (The Clash) 
 
Down the road came a Junco Partner 
For he was loaded as can be 
He was knocked out, knocked out loaded 
He was a'wobblin' all over the street 
 
Singing 6 months ain't no sentence 
And one year ain't no time 
I was born in Angola 
Serving 14 to 99 
 
Well I wish I had me $1 million dollars 
Oh one million to call my own 
I would raise meat and say, grow for me baby 
I would raise me a tobacco farm 
 
Well I wish I would have me a great deal of money 
Yeah and mighty good things all over town 
Now I ain't got no more money 
All of my good friends are putting me down 
 
So now I gotta pawn my rifle and pistol 
Yeah I'm gonna pawn my watch and chain 
I would have pawned my seat Gabriella 
But the smart girl she wouldn't sign her name 
 
Give me headstone when I die

Yea thought I'd find a rhythm in the junkie town 
Thought I'd find a rhythm when the junkies hang around 
 
Thought I'd go out walking to the junkie kind of beat 
Setting on those bars that the junkies meet 
The junkie slip! 
Nail it down 
The junkie slip! 
This side of town 
The junkie slip! 
And whatcha knowing before you's a doin 
The things they's a knowing 
You pawn your coat and your car 
Pawned your cigar and your old guitar 
You pawned your guitar and your saxaphone 
You're pawning everything in your mother's home 
 
Cos it's a junkie slip! 
Just like rock n' roll 
A junkie slip! 
Like Johnnny did the stroll 
And you know it feels alright 
But what's that feeling on a Saturday night? 
 
You're itching itching itching in your pillow in the day 
You're itching itching itching and you gave your coat away 
Itching itching itching and then in your sleeping bag 
There's a little packet that youthought you never had 
 
It's a junkie slip! 
Every night 
Junkie slip! 
Cold water fright 
It's a junkie slip 
And an old spoon cooky cooky cooky kooky afternoon 
All afternoon and in the middle of the night 
 
You're worse for the difference and it don't sleep tight 
Don't pull the curtains fon't put on the light 
C c c cos it's a junkie slip! 
What's goin' on? 
Was early night 
I lit the fire 
Finish alright 
Yeh Edi Edi Edi Yeh Edi Juan

Come in the car, it's an old machine 
Riding from Brookway on a magazine 
Be on that corner with a magazine 
 
Do ya do ya do ya follow your friends? 
Do I hear you saying that you're going back again? 
It's a junkie slip! 
Where? Did it end? 
But did it ah did it did it ever end? 
When did it ever end? 
Don't ask me when on a Wednesday night 
Don't ask me when on a Thrusday night 
I said oh? Who the hell are you? 
You said oh! Well you met me 
I said I can guess why

KINGSTON ADVICE

 (The Clash) 
 
In these days you can get no rice 
No razor blades but you can get knife 
In these days see the people run 
They have no food but the boy have gun 
In these days they don't throw the stone 
Nor use the voice they use the gun alone 
In these days to be an oddity 
Be hunted down like a scarcity 
 
In these days don't beg for life 
Wanna take Kingston advice? 
Oh please don't beg for your life 
 
In these days the beat is militant 
Must be a clash there's no alternative 
In these days nations are militant 
We have slavery under government 
In these days in the firmament 
I look for signs that are permanent 
 
In these days with no love to give 
The world will turn with no one left to live 
 
In these days I don't know what to do 
The more I see the more I'm destitute 
In these days I don't know what to sing 
The more I know the less my tune can swing 
 
In these days you can get no rice 
No razor blades but you can get knife 
In these days see the people run 
They have no food but the boy have gun

KOKA KOLA

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
Elevator! Going up! 
In the gleaming corridors of the 51st floor 
The money can be made if you really want some more 
Executive decision a clinical precision 
Jumping from the windows filled with indecision 
 
I get good advice from the advertising world 
Treat me nice says the party girl 
Koke adds life where there isn't any 
So freeze, man, freeze 
 
It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power 
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour 
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot 
You won't need a launderette, you can send them to the vet! 
 
I get my advice from the advertising world 
Treat me nice says the party girl 
Koke adds life where there isn't any 
So freeze, man, freeze 
 
Koka Kola advertising and kokaine 
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain 
Neon light sign says it 
I read it in the paper they're crazy! 
Suit your life, maybe so 
In the White House I know 
All Over Berlin (they've been doing it for years) 
And in Manhattan! 
 
Coming through the door is a snub nose 44 
What the barrel can't snort it can spatter on the floor 
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs 
And your tongue feels like a fish 
You're leaping from the windows saying don't 
Ayaiiiiirrrghhh! * !!* !!*! 
Don't give me none of this! 
 
I get good advice from the advertising world 
Treat me nice says the party girl 
Koke adds life where there isn't any 
So freeze, man, freeze 
Hit the deck!

LAST GANG IN TOWN

 (Strummer/Jones) 
Everybody's Looking For Last Gang In Town 
You Better Watch Out For They're All Comin' Around 
 
The Sport Of Today Is Exciting 
The In Crowd Are Into Infighting 
When Some Punk Sees Some Rock Olla 
It's Rock And Roll All Over 
In Every Street And Every Station 
Kids Fight Like Different Nations 
And It's Brawn Against Brain 
And It's Knife Against Chain 
But It's All Young Blood 
Flowing Down The Drain 
 
The Crops Hit The Stiffs 
An' The Spikes Whipped The Quiffs 
They're All Looking 'Round 
 
For The Last Gang In Town 
 
Meanwhile Down In Black Town 
Those Old Soul Rebels Are Haingin' Around 
An' When Some Punk Come Alooking For Sound 
Rastaferi Goes To Ground 
The White Heart Flipped His Pocket Dipped 
'Cos A Black Sharp Knife Never Slips 
And They Never Say To One Antoher 
That Tomorrow We Might Kill Our Brothers 
 
Down From The Edge Of London 
The Rockabily Rebels Came 
From Another Edge Of London 
Skinhead Gangs Call Out Their Name 
But Not The Zydeco Kids 
From The High Rise 
Though They Can't Be Recognized 
When You Hear A Cajun Fiddle 
Then You're Nearly In The Middle 
Of The Last Gang In Town

Atom secrets, secret leaflet

His downfall picks up locomotion 
 
The people must have something good to read on a Sunday 
 
The leader's wife takes a government car 
In the dark to meet her minister 
But the leader never leaves his door ajar 
As he swings his whip from the Boer War 
 
He wore a leather mask for his dinner guests 
Totally nude and with deep respect 
Proposed a toast to the votes he gets 
The feeling of power and the thought of sex! 
 
Now the girl let the fat man touch her 
Vodka fumes and the feel of a vulture 
The driver waited in the embassy car 
The fat man's trap was set for capture 
So the girl let the thin man touch her 
Mixing questions, drunken laughter 
The ministry car was waiting there 
A minister knows his own affair 
 
The people must have something good to read on a Sunday

Staring dreads are jerking their locks 
As the white star liner sank in the docks 
But on the drummers face, there is a look of dread 
As he drums away 400 years of dread 
The dancer man in the power of mas 
Is smoking ti the mighty sparrow's blast 
 
But you better be careful 
You still got to watch yourself 
 
You wanna be crazy 
So you wanna go crazy 
Let's go crazy 
So you wanna be crazy 
Then let's go crazy 
Let's go crazy 
 
The lawful force are here of course 
For special offenders for the special court 
But the young men know when the sun has set 
Darkness comes to settle the debt 
Owed by a year of S.U.S. and suspect 
Indiscriminate use of the power of arrest 
 
They're waiting for the sun to set 
 
The mighty observer who keeps his cabinets hot 
A great meeting of rhythm and face 
A humming of values and a children's place 
But the sticks man gives the copper good excuse 
To shut off the ganja and control the juice 
 
To control the juice 
 
So you wanna go crazy? Then let's go crazy 
So take it on crazy! So they get all crazy 
Bricks and bottles corrugated iron 
Shields and helmets carnival time

Ray symbolic from jamdown town

And I just can't go back home 
 
My girl if she had the dope 
We'd get the messieurs on the phone 
I still got to get up and go home 
Don't start driving on my headstone 
 
Go!

Make him want to stop, gonna fall on me

Make him want to stop, gonna (???) me

Well heard that your story goes 
You nearly broke down after half a mile 
 
Hey that is the way it goes 
You better keep a note on file 
You'll have to reap what I suppose 
Gets you a floor and a (???)

Make him want to stop, gonna fall on me 
Life is wild life is free

Hey! The last thing he'd expect in his bar 
Gonna chart the rise of my star

LIGHTNING STRIKES (NOT ONCE BUT TWICE)

Now lightning strikes in old New York 
It may be dark but I wanna talk 
It might rain, it might snow 
Too many things I got to know 
If this is spring than it's time to sing 
Never mind the l'il birdies wing 
Look out, look out, old New York 
New York's coming an' New York talks 
Hey! Strike! Not once... 
Strike! But twice! 
 
Get out your money peel a slab 
Roll some notes an' hail a cab 
Drive in church drive in back 
Drive down Seventh in a tank 
Take in the sights, feel the breeze 
See New York's one and only tree 
It can be found in Garbage park 
But don't inspect it after dark 
Strike! New York! Lightning! 
Not once but twice. 
 
Accidental hike in the transit strike 
Roller skate or ride a bike 
Three to a car, Brooklyn Bridge 
You won't get far if you're privileged 
Graffiti Jack sprays in black 
An Englishman can he read it back? 
Deli Joe he ought to know 
He runs the gang on Pastrami Row 
Strike! Lightning strike! 
 
Because glass to glass, street to street 
Buildings touch St. Peter's feet 
From car to bar, prez to shah 
Everything is in the jar 
The 4 winds blow cos the 4 winds know 
Takes a special hustle to make a roll 
Honey girl on her feet 
I wish everything to make her sweet 
Strike! Twice! OK so roll! 
From Harlem! Strike one! 
 
Harlem slum to penthouse block 
On every door I already knocked 
There wasn't anybody that I didn't leave alone 
Somebody lying under every stone 
Everything that a man could need 
In a bag down by my knee 
That looks good, this ain't got seeds 
Cheaper than booze down in the bowery 
Lightning strike! Old New York! 
Everything's light! Strike! 
 
Hey ho such a night 
I'll see y'all when the lightning strike 
A polaroid caught in the act 
You're married too and that's a fact 
But I won't peek and I won't squeek 
Down by the trucks on Christopher Street 
It's Cuban Day Oi Vey 
Chinese New Year let's call it a day 
Tootsie! Hey Chi man! 
That melody is Puerto Rican 
Hey Chi man is what he's speaking 
An' there's the road down into London Town 
Where many cars get broken down 
It's the Westway from Ladbroke Grove 
Runs down to Old Hounslow 
Just thought I'd mention the new extention 
That run's down the 59th street intersection 
Did you hear the news y'all? 
London Town on the Broadway!

And some will tell you dat you dreader than dread 
 
And a some a say a Clash a you ruler 
See a Clash sound cooler, aaaye! 
Clash sound sweeter 
Man a measure mile in a metre, eh! 
 
When you living inna fame 
You got to live up to your name 
Or else you suffer and you die inna shame 
It's all in the game, eh! 
 
This is the game of life 
We no wa' no strife

LONDON CALLING

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
London calling to the faraway towns 
Now that war is declared and battle come down 
London calling to the underworld 
Come out of the cupboard, all you boys and girls 
London calling, now don't look at us 
All that phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust 
London calling, see we ain't got no swing 
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing 
 
CHORUS 
The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in 
Engines stop running and the wheat is growing thin 
A nuclear error, but I have no fear 
London is drowning and I live by the river 
 
London calling to the imitation zone 
Forget it, brother, an' go it alone 
London calling upon the zombies of death 
Quit holding out and draw another breath 
London calling and I don't wanna shout 
But when we were talking I saw you nodding out 
London calling, see we ain't got no highs 
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes 
 
CHORUS 
 
Now get this 
London calling, yeah, I was there, too 
An' you know what they said? Well, some of it was true! 
London calling at the top of the dial 
After all this, won't you give me a smile? 
 
I never felt so much a' like

The Ice Age Is Coming, The Sun Is Zooming In 
Engines Stop Running And The Wheat Is Growing Thin

Forget It, Brother, An' Go It Alone 
London Calling Upon The Zombies Of Death

London's burning with boredom now 
London's burning dial 99999 
 
I'm up and down the Westway, in an' out the lights

London's burning with boredom now

LONG TIME JERK

 (The Clash) 
 
Gonna scrape the trouble off my boots! 
 
As they were dancing in the evening 
And the light shone through the trees 
This girl my eye was following 
Asked the band to play her a beat 
 
Singin' she'd do that long time jerk 
She hit me where it hurts 
Ohhh your heart 
Now my heart will burst 
Oh no 
 
Ah, but it took me back to that wonderland 
I witnessed long ago 
Babbling words of preachers 
Sayin' Don't bury me no more 
 
Ohh... 
 
And I've forgotten how to worry 
And I don't know how to run 
Against the odds I realize 
This struggle could be won! 
 
We dance 
 
Long time jerk 
She did it to me first 
Ohhh my heart 
With that long time jerk 
 
Ah! Say..... Do that long time jerk. 
 
Bring on those tapes from the past 
They make you look better in a mirror 
Feel that long time jerkin' 
Between the taker and the giver 
 
Feel that... 
 
Long time jerk 
She hit me where it hurts 
Oh I felt my heart 
Now my heart will burst 
 
I've forgotten how to worry 
And I don't know how to run 
Against the odds I realize 
This struggle could be fun! 
 
Oh, through lanes and streets and houses 
And reversing rush of time 
She made me re invent the world 
Before inventing time 
(Before inventing time) 
 
Long time jerk 
Oh, she hit me where it hurts 
Ohhhhh my heart 
Long time jerk 
 
Long, long, long, long, long 
Long time 
Long time jerk

Look here!

Gonna be doin' next year? 
No lie... 
How you know you're not 
Gonna up and die? 
No doubt... 
 
Soon enough your friends 
Will find you out 
Take care... 
You know you might not have 
Too much time to spare 
I say... 
 
How long have you been acting 
Up this way? 
One knows... 
When you gonna get 
Your own floorshow 
I'm hip... 
And you could use a button 
On your lip 
 
Look here 
What d'you think you're 
Gonna be doing next year 
I'm hip!

LOSE THIS SKIN

 (Tymon Dogg) 
 
Come with me. I won't hide 
We're going on a ride 
We meet each day, use time to see 
While we're young and almost free 
 
I've got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in 
Got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in 
 
Do not turn or hate to see 
All the things you think we've got 
Do not turn or hate to see 
What happened to the wife of Lot 
 
We're alone or so they say 
We're not on our own in that way 
When we're alone it's real tough going 
We can take a part in someone else's play 
 
Come with me, I thought he said 
But that's not him anymore, he's dead 
What's it like to be so free 
So free it looks like lost to me

LOST IN THE SUPERMARKET

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
CHORUS 
I'm all lost in the supermarket 
I can no longer shop happily 
I came in her for that special offer 
A guaranteed personality 
 
I wasn't born so much as I fell out 
Nobody seemed to notice me 
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs 
Over which I never could see 
 
I heard the people who lived on the ceiling 
Scream and fight most scarily 
Hearing that noise was my first ever feeling 
That's how it's been all around me 
 
CHORUS 
 
I'm all tuned in, I see all the programmes 
I save coupons from packets of tea 
I've got my giant hit discoteque album 
I empty a bottle and I feel a bit free 
 
The kids in the halls and the pipes in the walls 
Make me noises for company 
Long distance callers make long distance calls 
And the silence makes me lonely 
 
CHORUS 
 
And it's not hear 
It disappear 
I'm all lost

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
Yeh, you must treat your lover girl right 
If you wanna make lover's rock 
You must know a place you can kiss to make lovers rock 
'Cause everybody knows it's a crying shame 
But nobody knows the poor babie's name 
When she forgot that thing that she had to swallow 
 
You Western man, you're free with your seed 
When you make lovers rock 
But woops! there goes the strength that you need 
To make real cool lovers rock 
'Cause a genuine lover takes off his clothes 
And he can make a lover in a thousand go's 
An' she don't need that thing that she had to swallow

MIDNIGHT LOG

 (The Clash) 
 
Working for the devil 
You'll have to pay his tax 
That means going to see him 
Down among the racks 
You do his work so fine 
He'll remember you 
 
Worried for my friend 
As he shows me round the flat 
Where I don't wanna find him 
His lips an' eyelids black 
He don't believe my speech 
That lines can and should be drawn 
Lke if he had a shotgun 
The barrels would be sawn 
 
Swallowed by the river 
Swollen by the rains 
That leakin' ol' computer 
Of fingerprints and names 
Swimming in the river 
That floods the neighborhood 
I would call to you 
But it would do no good 
 
Voting for the law 
That's the general occupation 
First comes the public safety 
Second comes the nation 
You won't believe me now 
But there's been some illumination 
The wisest cops have realized 
They fucked the operation 
 
Cooking up the books 
A respected occupation 
The anchor and foundation of multi corporations 
They don't believe in crime 
They don't know that it exists 
But to understand 
What's right and wrong 
The lawyers work in shifts 
 
'N speaking of the devil 
He ain't been seen for years 
'Cept every 20 mins 
He zooms between me ears 
I don't believe in books 
But I read all the time 
For ciphers to the riddles 
An' reasons to the rhymes 


 

CLASH (THE)
MIDNIGHT TO STEVENS

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
I SEARCHED THROUGH THE DRINKERS 
EACH PROPPED OVER HIS GLASS 
I RAN THROUGH EACH BAR 
UNTIL I FOUND GUY AT LAST 
GUY YOU'VE BEEN TO THE DOCTOR 
NO I DON'T THINK IT WISE 
TOOK ONE OF HIS PILLS 
BOILED THE BLOOD IN MY EYES. 
 
WHEN YOU PLAYED THE MASTER MIX 
TO THE COMPANY MAN 
TOOK THREE MILLION WORLDWIDE 
TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND 
YOU DON'T WORK FOR PEANUTS 
BUT THEY'LL PUSH YOU TOO 
IT'S THAT COMPANY TRICK 
WE'RE ALL JUMPING THROUGH 
BET YOU AIN'T HAD NO FOOD NOW 
SINCE YOU LAST WENT TO SLEEP 
THE WILD SEED THAT WAS SOWED 
WILL TAKE FOREVER TO REAP. 
 
WHAT DAYS AND NIGHTS THOUGH 
ROCKING OUT OF HAM YARD 
OH SKIP THAT FANDANGO 
BRING THE BLUES BACK DOWN HARD 
THOUGH CHUCK WOULD NEVER ADMIT IT 
AT THE DOOR OF THE JAIL 
THERE STOOD GUY STEVENS 
AND HE WAS WAVING THE BAIL. 
 
GUY YOU'VE FINISHED THE BOOZE 
AND YOU RUN OUT OF SPEED 
BUT THE WILD SIDE OF LIFE 
IS THE ONE THAT WE NEED. 


 

CLASH (THE)
MOVERS AND SHAKERS

 (Strummer/Rhodes) 
 
The boy stood in the burning slum 
Better times had to come 
Fate lay in the hands that clap 
The muscles that move & the power that raps 
He went up on money street 
Waving an poping to the beat 
Off his wits an on his feet 
He worked a coin from the cold concrete 
 
Movers & shakers come on you got what it takes to make it 
Movers an shakers come on even if you have to fake it 
 
Where the highway meets the lights 
With a red bandanna & rapid wipes 
He shines Glass and he cleans chrome 
He'll accept what he gets thrown 
This man earns cos its understood 
Times are bad and he's makin good 
Down on him but he's got it beat 
He's working coin from the cold concrete 
 
Movers & shakers come on....etc 
And when I see you down & I say 
That aint no way through that aint no way through 
Movers & shakers come on....etc 
 
Way back in some city heat 
When a friend was anybody with food to eat 
It was lousy life with a leaking roof 
We got up to find that truth 
Make a drum from a garbage can 
Allow your tongue to be a man 
When the beat propels you off your seat 
You got it made in the cold concrete 
 
Movers & shakers come on! 


 

CLASH (THE)
MUSTAPHA DANCE

 (The Clash) 
 
The sheik he drove his cadillac 
 
Shareef 
Rockin the casbah

Fundamentally he can't take it 
You know he really hates it 
Really, really hates it 


 

CLASH (THE)
NORTH AND SOUTH

 (Strummer/Rhodes) 
 
And so we say 
We ain't got life 
Don't want a cardboard cut out 
Don't want a plastic knife 
 
Now I know, time can march 
With it's chargin' feet 
Now I know, words are only cheap 
It's gonna be a burn out 
All around this town 
The South is up 
But the North is down 
 
There's gonna be a killin' 
Of a woman and a man 
Trying to feed that child 
Without a coin in their hand 
 
And so we say 
Have you no use 
For eight million hands 
And the power of youth 
 
Now I know, time can march 
With it's chargin' feet 
Now I know, words are only cheap 
It's gonna be a burn out 
All around this town 
The South is up 
But the North is down 
 
There's gonna be a killin' 
Of a woman and a man 
Trying to feed that child 
Without a coin in their hand 
 
It's gonna be a burn out! 
 
And so we say 
We ain't diggin' no graves 
We're diggin' a foundation 
For a future to be made 
 
Now I know, time can march 
With it's chargin' feet 
Now I know, words are only cheap 
It's gonna be a burn out 
All around this town 
The South is up 
But the North is down 
 
There's gonna be a killin' 
Of a woman and a man 
Trying to feed that child 
Without a coin in their hand 
 
It's gonna be a burn out!

ONE EMOTION

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
One emotion 
It's all over the place 
You let it get out 
It cuts in your face 
 
One emotion 
Back of a shop 
Everybody wants what the next guy's got 
 
One emotion 
One emotion 
All you ever know 
Is your narrow life 
One emotion 
 
One emotion 
Don't think I don't trust 
People trample people on the daily bus 
 
One emotion 
Fighting through the night 
And if you can keep your buttons down 
When it gets right 
 
One emotion 
One emotion 
All you ever know 
Is your narrow life 
One emotion 
 
One emotion 
Smokin' through the town 
Banging on the doors 
And (???) 
 
One emotion 
Boy meets girl 
Smashing (???) 
It's that kind of world 
 
One emotion 
One emotion 
All you ever know 
Is your narrow life 
One emotion 
 
One emotion 
Moving out loud 
Better get your weapon ready 
Walking through the crowd 
 
One emotion 
Back of a shop 
Everybody wants what the next guy's got 
 
One emotion 
One emotion 
All you ever know 
Is your narrow life 
One emotion 
 
One emotion 
Emotion 


 

CLASH (THE)
ONE MORE DUB

 (The Clash) 
 
Stop wastin' time 
Right 
 
One more breath 
 
One more time in the ghetto 
One more time if you please 
One 
 
One more time for the dying man 
One more time if you please now 
 
One more time 


 

CLASH (THE)
ONE MORE TIME

 (The Clash) 
 
Must I get a witness? for all this misery 
There's no need to, brothers everybody can see 
That its one more time in the ghetto you know 
One more time if you please now 
One more time to the dying man 
They say one more time if you please 
 
The old lady kicks karate 
For just a little walk down the street 
The little baby he knows kung fu 
He tries it on those he meets 
Cos its a one more time! 
 
You don't need no silicone to calculate poverty 
Watch when Watts town burns again 
The bus goes to Montgomery 
 
Cos it's a one more time in the ghetto 
One more time if you please 
One more time for the dying man 
One more time to be free 


 

CLASH (THE)
OVERPOWERED BY FUNK

If you ain't reggae for it..funk out! 
No one knocking at your door? 
Overpowered by funk? Funk out! 
 
Combatative, repetitive 
Don't life just funk you out? 
Asanine, stupifying 
Can the clone line dry you out? 
 
Part of the swarming mass? Funk out! 
Slugged by the new increase? 
Scared of the human bomb? 
Overpowered by funk? Funk out! 
 
Buy dog food 
Rogue elephants 
Tarzan on a ticker tape 
Breakfast, serials? 
You know you can't escape 
 
Overpowered by funk 
Don't you love our Western ways? 
Car crashed by funk 
Don't you love our Western ways? 
 
Benny Goodman, trial by jury 
A phone box full of books 
Dustcarts and sunrise 
No one gets off the hooks car crashed... 
Food for the hungry millions? Funk out! 
Home for the floating people? 
Skin for the napalm victim? 
Overdrunk on power 
Funk out! 
 
The final game will be solitaire 
Overdrunk on power...funk out 
 
Picture frame, tickets here 
For the graffiti train 
People at home show you care 
Don't try 
Fry me in your shockin' chairs 
Funkpower over and out 
 
This is a message from Futura 
Don't prophisize the future 
I liven up the culture 
Because I'm deadly as a vulture 
I paint on civilization 
It's environmentally wack 
So presenting my attack 
I'll brighten up your shack 
I'm down by law 
That's a fact 
Just give me a wall. 
Any building dull or tall 
I spray clandestine night subway 
I cover red purple on top of grey 
Hey, no slashing cuz it ain't the way 
The T.A. blew 40 mil they say 
We thew down by night 
They scrubbed it off by day 
OK tourists

CLASH (THE)
REBEL WALTZ

 (The Clash) 
 
I slept and I dreamed of a time long ago 
I saw an army of rebels, dancing on air 
I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfires, 
A song of the battle, that was born in the flames, 
and the rebels were waltzing on air. 
 
I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz 
that was written to be danced on the battlefield 
I danced to the tune of a voice of a girl 
A voice that called Stand till we fall 
we stand till all the boys fall. 
 
As we danced came the news that the war was not won 
5 armies were coming, with carrige and gun 
Through the heart of the camp 
swept the news from the front 
A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food 
We knew the war could not be won. 
 
So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun 
in a glade through the trees i saw my only one 
Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun 
The soldiers were dying, there was tune to the sighing. 
The song was an old rebel one. 
 
As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field 
My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees 
I slept as I dreamed I saw the army rise 
A voice began to call, stand till you fall 
The tune was an old rebel one. 


 

CLASH (THE)
RED ANGEL DRAGNET

 (The Clash) 
 
I come from a long way away 
And I know a fine thing when I see it. 
See it 
For the same reason no one ever 
Pointed a telescope at the sun 
Talking about the Red Angels of New York City 
 
CHORUS 
Who shot the shot? 
Who got shot tonite? 
 
Not even five enforcement agencies can save their own. 
Never mind the people 
Tonite it's raining on the Angels of the City 
Did anyone prophesize these people? 
 
Only Travis 
Come in Travis 
One of these days I'm gonna get myself organized. 
 
All the animals come out at night. 
Queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick venal. 
Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets. 
 
Thank god for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk. Listen you screwheads: 
Here is a man who would not take it anymore. 
A man who stood up against the scum, the filth. 
Now I see clearly. 
 
Personally I know the alley 
Where Jack feeds on the birds of night 
Not even bubbies on bicycles 2x2 
Can stop the blood and feathers flying 
 
Waring overalls and for once and for all 
What is the dream? 
I'll tell it 
To live like they do in the movies 
San Juan you listening? 
 
Yeah I bet you are 
Hands up for Hollywood 
Hooray 
I hear you 
Snappy on the air 
Hang in their 
Wall to wall 
You saved the worled 
What else? You saved the girl 
Chmpagne on ice 
No stranger to Alcatraz 
To boot 
Or strip it down 
Chop it a little 
Being reasonable 
Just freedom to move 
To live 
For women to take a walk in the park at midnite 
Hey, but this is serious 
She can't even get back home 
 
I come from a long way off 
And I know a lifegiver over a lifetaker 
For the same reason no one ever pointed 
A gun at a policeman 
Talking about the Red Angels of New York City 
Yeah

Now the king told the boogie men 
You have to let that raga drop 
The oil down the desert way 
Has been shakin' to the top 
The sheik he drove his Cadillac 
He went a' cruisnin' down the ville 
The muezzin was a' standing 
On the radiator grille 
 
CHORUS 
The shareef don't like it 
Rockin' the Casbah 
Rock the Casbah 
The shareef don't like it 
Rockin' the Casbah 
Rock the Casbah 
 
By order of the prophet 
We ban that boogie sound 
Degenerate the faithful 
With that crazy Casbah sound 
But the Bedouin they brought out 
The electric camel drum 
The local guitar picker 
Got his guitar picking thumb 
As soon as the shareef 
Had cleared the square 
They began to wail 
 
CHORUS 
 
Now over at the temple 
Oh! They really pack 'em in 
The in crowd say it's cool 
To dig this chanting thing 
But as the wind changed direction 
The temple band took five 
The crowd caught a wiff 
Of that crazy Casbah jive 
 
CHORUS 
 
The king called up his jet fighters 
He said you better earn your pay 
Drop your bombs between the minarets 
Down the Casbah way 
 
As soon as the shareef was 
Chauffeured outta there 
The jet pilots tuned to 
The cockpit radio blare 
 
As soon as the shareef was 
Outta their hair 
The jet pilots wailed 
 
CHORUS 
 
He thinks it's not kosher 
Fundamentally he can't take it. 
You know he really hates it.

On the radiator grille 
 
CHORUS 
The shareef don't like it 
Rockin' the Casbah 
Rock the Casbah 
The shareef don't like it 
Rockin' the Casbah 
Rock the Casbah 
 
By order of the prophet 
We ban that boogie sound 
Degenerate the faithful 
With that crazy Casbah sound 
But the Bedouin they brought out 
The electric camel drum 
The local guitar picker 
Got his guitar picking thumb 
As soon as the shareef 
Had cleared the square 
They began to wail 
 
CHORUS 
 
Now over at the temple 
Oh! They really pack 'em in 
The in crowd say it's cool 
To dig this chanting thing 
But as the wind changed direction 
The temple band took five 
The crowd caught a wiff 
Of that crazy Casbah jive 
 
CHORUS 
 
The king called up his jet fighters 
He said you better earn your pay 
Drop your bombs between the minarets 
Down the Casbah way 
 
As soon as the shareef was 
Chauffeured outta there 
The jet pilots tuned to 
The cockpit radio blare 
 
As soon as the shareef was 
Outta their hair 
The jet pilots wailed 
 
CHORUS 
 
He thinks it's not kosher 
Fundamentally he can't take it. 
You know he really hates it.

Some ol' guy takes a swig 
And passes back the jar 
But where they were last night 
No one can remember 
Somebody got murdered 
Goodbye, for keeps, forever 
 
Somebody got murdered 
Somebody's dead forever 
 
And you're minding your own business 
Carrying spare change 
You wouldn't cosh a barber 
You're hungry all the same 
I been very tempted 
To grab it from the till 
I been very hungry 
But not enough to kill 
 
Somebody got murdered 
His name cannot be found 
A small stain on the pavement 
They'll scrub it off the ground 
As the daily crown disperses 
No one says that much 
Somebody got murdered 
And it' left me with a touch 
 
Somebody got murdered 
Somebody's dead forever 
Sounds like murder! 
Those shouts! 
Are they drunk down below? 
 
It's late, and my watch stopped 
Some time ago 
Sounds like murder! 
Those screams! 
Are they drunk down below?

SOMETHING ABOUT ENGLAND

 (The Clash) 
 
They say immigrants steal the hubcaps 
Of the respected gentlemen 
They say it would be wine an' roses 
If England were for Englishmen again 
 
Well I saw a dirty overcoat 
At the foot of the pillar of the road 
Propped inside was an old man 
Whom time would not erode 
When the night was snapped by sirens 
Those blue lights circled fast 
The dancehall called for an' ambulance 
The bars all closed up fast 
 
My silence gazing at the ceiling 
While roaming the single room 
I thought the old man could help me 
If he could explain the gloom 
You really think it's all new 
You really think about it too 
The old man scoffed as he spoke to me 
I'll tell you a thing or two 
 
I missed the fourteen eighteen war 
But not the sorrow afterwards 
With my father dead and my mother ran off 
My brothers took the pay of hoods 
The twenties turned the north was dead 
The hunger strike came marching south 
At the garden party not a word was said 
The ladies lifted cake to their mouths 
 
The next war began and my ship sailed 
With battle orders writ in bed 
In five long years of bullets and shells 
We left tem million dead 
The few returned to old Piccadily 
We limped around Leicster Square 
The world was busy rebuilding itself 
The architects could not care 
 
But how could we know when I was young 
All the canges that were to come? 
All the photos in the wallets on the battlefield 
And now the terror of the scientific sun 
There was masters an' servants an' servants an' dogs 
They taught you how to touch your cap 
But through strikes an' famine an' war an' peace 
England never closed this gap 
 
So leave me now the moon is up 
But remember all the tales I tell 
The memories that you have dredged up 
Are on letters forwarded from hell 
 
The streets were by now deserted 
The gangs had trudged off home 
The lights clicked off in the bedsits 
An' old England was all alone 


 

CLASH (THE)
SOUND OF THE SINNERS, THE

 (The Clash) 
 
As the floods of God 
Wash away sin city 
They say it was written 
In the page of the Lord 
But I was looking 
For that great jazz note 
That destroyed 
The walls of Jericho 
 
The winds of fear 
Whip away the sickness 
The messages on the tablet 
Was valium 
As the planets form 
That golden cross Lord 
I'll see you on 
The holy cross roads 
 
After all this time 
To believe in Jesus 
After all those drugs 
I thought I was Him 
After all my lying 
And a crying 
And my suffering 
I ain't good enough 
I ain't clean enough 
To be Him 
 
The tribal wars 
Burning up the homeland 
The fuel of evil 
Is raining from the sky 
The sea of lava 
Flowing down the mountain 
The time will sleep 
Us sinners by 
 
Holy rollers roll 
Give generously now 
Pass the hubcap please 
Thank you Lord

SPANISH BOMBS

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
Spanish songs in Andalucia 
The shooting sites in the days of '39 
Oh, please, leave the vendanna open 
Fredrico Lorca is dead and gone 
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls 
The black cars of the Guardia Civil 
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica 
I'm flying in a DC 10 tonight 
 
CHORUS 
Spanish bombs, yo tequierro y finito 
Yote querda, oh mi corazon 
Spanish bombs, yo te quierro y finito 
Yo te querda, oh mi corazon 
 
Spanish weeks in my disco casino 
The freedom fighters died upon the hill 
They sang the red flag 
They wore the black one 
But after they died it was Mockingbird Hill 
Back home the buses went up in flashes 
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood 
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels 
My senorita's rose was nipped in the bud 
 
CHORUS 
 
The hillsides ring with Free the people 
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39? 
With trenches full of poets 
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line 
Spanish bombs rock the province 
I'm hearing music from another time 
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava 
I'm flying in on a DC 10 tonight 
Spanish songs in Andalucia, Mandolina, oh mi corazon 
Spanish songs in Granada, oh mi corazon

The hillsides ring with Free the people 
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39? 
With trenches full of poets 
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line 
Spanish bombs rock the province 
I'm hearing music from another time 
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava 
I'm flying in on a DC 10 tonight 
Spanish songs in Andalucia, Mandolina, oh mi corazon 
Spanish songs in Granada, oh mi corazon 


 

CLASH (THE)
SPANISH BOMBS

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
Spanish songs in Andalucia 
The shooting sites in the days of '39 
Oh, please, leave the vendanna open 
Fredrico Lorca is dead and gone 
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls 
The black cars of the Guardia Civil 
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica 
I'm flying in a DC 10 tonight 
 
CHORUS 
Spanish bombs, yo tequierro y finito 
Yote querda, oh mi corazon 
Spanish bombs, yo te quierro y finito 
Yo te querda, oh mi corazon 
 
Spanish weeks in my disco casino 
The freedom fighters died upon the hill 
They sang the red flag 
They wore the black one 
But after they died it was Mockingbird Hill 
Back home the buses went up in flashes 
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood 
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels 
My senorita's rose was nipped in the bud 
 
CHORUS 
 
The hillsides ring with Free the people 
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39? 
With trenches full of poets 
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line 
Spanish bombs rock the province 
I'm hearing music from another time 
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava 
I'm flying in on a DC 10 tonight 
Spanish songs in Andalucia, Mandolina, oh mi corazon 
Spanish songs in Granada, oh mi corazon

We Met When We Were In School 
Never Took No Shit From No One, We Weren't Fools 
The Teacher Says We're Dumb 
We're Only Having Fun 
We Piss On Everyone 
In The Classroom 
 
When We Got Thrown Out I Left Without Much Fuss 
An' Weekends We'd Go Dancing 
Down Streatham On The Bus 
You Always Made Me Laugh 
 
Got Me In Bad Fights 
Play Me Pool All Night 
Smokin' Menthol 
 
I Practised Daily In My Room 
You Were Down The Crown Planning Your Next Move 
Go On A Nicking Spree 
Hit The Wrong Guy 
Each Of You Get Three 
Years In Brixton 
 
I Did My Very Best To Write 
How Was Butlins? 
Were The Screws Too Tight? 
When You Lot Get Out 
Were Gonna Hit The Town 
We'll Burn It Fuckin' Down 
To A Cinder 
 
Cos Years Have Passed And Things Have Changed 
And I Move Anyway I Wanna Go 
I'll Never Forget The Feeling I Got 
When I Heard That You'd Got Home 
An' I'll Never Forget The Smile On My Face 
'Cos I Knew Where You Would Be 
An' If You're In The Crown Tonight 
Have A Drink On Me 
But Go Easy...Step Lightly...Stay Free

CLASH (THE)
STOP THE WORLD

 (The Clash) 
 
THE PANORAMA OF THE CITY IS WRONG 
IN FACT THE CITY SEEMS TO BE GONE! 
BURNING RUBBER AND SMOKE IN MY EYES 
THERE'S A FLAT BURNING JUNKHEAP 
FOR TWENTY SQUARE MILES! 
THEY TOOK IT INTO THE NUCLEAR MINE 
JUDGING BY THIS, THEY LEFT NOTHING BEHIND 
DOWN IN THE BUNKERS IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH 
NOW CROUCH THE WEALTHY AND THE NOBLE OF BIRTH 
 
IF I COULD A RIDE A TRAIN AROUND THE CITY 
THAT HOLDS THIS AS OUR FATE 
I'D HIDE FROM ELECTRO CIRCUIT CENTRAL 
TO THE SHOCK INDUCER GATE 
NOT FORGETTING THE BY PASS 
ACROSS THE WASHINGTON HOOKS 
THROUGH THE PHONES AND DESKS AND SCREENS 
OF THE KREMLIN'S CROOK OF CROOKS 
 
THERE'S SOME PANEL IN A CIRCUIT BOARD 
DESTINATION OF THE OVERRIDE 
SCANNING THE WILD WIND 
BLOWING THROUGH THE BERLIN CORRIDOR 
SPOTLIT IN A PALACE, SHIELDED FROM DUST 
MALFUNCTION OR NOT, THE FAILSAFE IS THE CRUX 
SO FAR AWAY FROM US, 
SHAKING WITH THE MYSTERY TEARS 
ONE LONELY NIGHT IN LADBROKE GROVE 
FAR AWAY IN THE DESERTS OF OMAHA! 
THEY GOT IT NAILED DOWN SWISS TIGHT! 
THE BANK NOTES OF EUROPE 
THE EMPERORS AND KINGS 
CURL IN THE AUTUMN AS THE BURNING OF LEAVES 
AND I'VE CLEANED MY BLACK GUITAR...

STRAIGHT TO HELL

 (The Clash) 
 
If you can play on the fiddle 
How's about a British jig and reel? 
Speaking King's English in quotation 
As railhead towns feel the steel mills rust water froze 
In the generation 
Clear as winter ice 
This is your paradise 
 
There ain't no need for ya 
Go straight to hell boys 
 
Y'wanna join in a chorus 
Of the Amerasian blues? 
When it's Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City 
Kiddie say papa papa papa papa san take me home 
See me got photo photo 
Photograph of you 
Mamma Mamma Mamma san 
Of you and Mamma Mamma Mamma san 
Lemme tell ya 'bout your blood bamboo kid. 
It ain't Coca Cola it's rice. 
 
Straight to hell 
Oh Papa san 
Please take me home 
Oh Papa san 
Everybody they wanna go home 
So Mamma san says 
 
You wanna play mind crazed banjo 
On the druggy drag ragtime U.S.A.? 
In Parkland International 
Hah! Junkiedom U.S.A. 
Where procaine proves the purest rock man groove 
and rat poison 
The volatile Molatov says 
 
PSSST... 
HEY CHICO WE GOT A MESSAGE FOR YA... 
VAMOS VAMOS MUCHACHO 
FROM ALPHABET CITY ALL THE WAY A TO Z, DEAD, HEAD 
 
Go straight to hell 
 
Can you really cough it up loud and strong 
The immigrants 
They wanna sing all night long 
It could be anywhere 
Most likely could be any frontier 
Any hemisphere 
No man's land and there ain't no asylum here 
King Solomon he never lived round here 
 
Go straight to hell boys

STREET PARADE, THE

 (The Clash) 
 
When I was waiting for your phonecall 
The one that never came 
Like a man about to burst 
I was dying of thirst 
 
Though I will never fade 
Or get lost in this daze 
Though I will disappear 
Into the street parade 
 
It's not too hard to cry 
In these crying times 
I'll take a broken heart 
And take it home in parts 
But I will never fade 
 
I was in this place 
By the first church of the city 
I saw tears on the face 
The face of a visionary 
 
Though I will disappear 
To join the street parade 
Disappear and fade 
Into the street parade

CLASH (THE)
THIS IS ENGLAND

 (Strummer/Rhodes) 
 
I hear a gang fire on a human factory farm 
Are they howling out or doing somebody harm 
On a catwalk jungle somebody grabbed my arm 
A voice spoke so cold it matched the weapon in her palm 
 
This is England 
This knife of Sheffield steel 
This is England 
This is how we feel 
 
Time on his hands freezing in those clothes 
He won't go for the carrot 
They beat him by the pole 
Some sunny day confronted by his soul 
He's out at sea, too far off, he can't go home 
 
This is England 
What we're supposed to die for 
This is England 
And we're never gonna cry no more 
 
Black shadow of the Vincent 
Falls on a Triumph line 
I got my motorcycle jacket 
But I'm walking all the time 
South Atlantic wind blows 
Ice from a dying creed 
I see no glory 
When will we be free 
 
This is England 
We can chain you to the rail 
This is England 
We can kill you in a jail 
 
The British boots go kick them 
Got 'em in the head 
Police ain't watchin' 
The newspapers been read 
Who cares to protest 
A (???) in the eye like a flare 
Out came the batons and 
The British warned themselves 
 
This is England 
The land of (il)legal dances 
This is England 
Land of a thousand stances 
This is England 
This knife of Sheffield steel 
This is England 
This is how we feel 
This is England 
This is England

THREE CARD TRICK

 (Strummer/Rhodes) 
 
Patriots of the wasteland torching two hundred years 
Dragging my spirit back into the dungeon again 
Bring back crucification cry the moral death's head legion 
Using steel nails manufactured by the slaves in Asia 
 
You wont fall for that law and order is a baton in the rib 
You wont fall for that just like your mummy & your daddy did 
 
Blood inside a fountain pen wrote you out of life again 
& who knows any better than to kick and scratch under English weather 
>From a chain gang to the mill. The mill that sits on top of the hill 
The fog drowned towns arr gonna have to fade 
The wrong side of the a scissor blade 
 
You wont fall for that law and order is a baton in the rib 
You wont fall for that just like your mummy & your daddy did 
I'll eat my hat I'm gonna be sick 
They own the pack while we play the three card trick 
 
Dont you remember the place 
Where we hid the ace? 
Yeah not thick but slick 
Now we all gotta play the three card trick

Say you stand by your man 
Tell me something I don't understand 
You said you love me and that's a fact 
Then you left me, said you felt trapped 
 
Well some things you can explain away 
But my heartache's in me till this day 
 
CHORUS 
Did you stand by me 
No, not at all 
Did you stand by me 
No way 
 
All the times 
When we were close 
I'll remember these things the most 
I see all my dreams come tumbling down 
I won't be happy without you around 
 
So all alone I keep the wolves at bay 
There is only one thing that I can say 
 
CHORUS 
 
You must explain why this must be 
Did you lie when you spoke to me 
 
Did you stand by me 
No, not at all 
 
Now I got a job 
But it don't pay 
I need new clothes 
I need somewhere to stay 
But without all these things I can do 
But without your love I won't make it through 
 
But you don't understand my point of view 
I suppose there's nothing I can do

CLASH (THE)
UP IN HEAVEN (NOT ONLY HERE)

 (The Clash) 
 
The towers of London, these crumbling rocks 
Reality estates that the hero's got 
And every hour's maked by the chime of a clock 
And whatcha gonna do when the darkness surrounds? 
You can piss in the lifts which have broken down 
You can watch from the debris the last bedroom light 
We're invisible here just past midnight 
 
The wives hate their husbands and their husbands don't care 
Their children daub slogans to prove they lived there 
A giant pipe organ up in the air 
You can't live in a home which should not have been built 
By the bourgeoise clerks who bear no guilt 
When the wind hits this building this building it tilts 
One day it will surely fall to the ground... 
 
Fear is just another commodity here 
They sell us peeping holes to peek when we hear 
A bang on the door resoundingly clear 
Who would really want to move in here? 
The children play faraway, the corridors are bare 
This room is a cage its like captivity 
How can anyone exist in such misery? 
 
It has been said not only here 
 
 Allianza dollars are spent 
To raise the towering buildings 
For the weary bones of the workers 
To go back in the morning 
To be strong in the morning 


 

CLASH (THE)
VERSION CITY

 (The Clash) 
 
There is a train at Version City 
Waiting for the rhythm mail 
If you can jump then jump right now 
She can pull you through to better days 
 
Is that the train that the speak off 
The one I heard in my younger days 
All great bluesmen have rode her 
I'm jumping up gonna ride that train 
 
There's a lonely soul out on the crossroads 
He's waiting there in the pouring rain 
He's looking for that great ride yeh 
That'll take him to oh what's her name 
 
So I rode that train from Version City 
For ninety nine an' one half days 
Never heard such rhythm sound 
It was in my soul which was on the train 
 
We went straight through Syndrum Inc. 
Up an' over the Acapella Pass 
Then Gibson Town and Fenderville 
All stations to the Mesa Boogie Ranch 
We saw that soul out on the cross roads 
Waitin' there in the pouring rain 
We called hey engine slow your rhythms 
See he wants to ride the version train 
 
We rode that train from Version City 
For ninety nine and one half years 
I never seen such funky country 
While riding with the engineers 
 
Could not fill no application 
Before I rode this rhythm train 
Could not work at my station 
Before I rode the version train 
 
There is a train at Version City 
Waiting for the rhythm mail 
If you can jump then jump right now 
She can pull you through to better days

WASHINGTON BULLETS

 (The Clash) 
 
Oh! Mama, Mama look there! 
Your children are playing in that street again 
Don't you know what happened down there? 
A youth of fourteen got shot down there 
The Kokane guns of Jamdown Town 
The killing clowns, the blood money men 
Are shooting those Washington bullets again 
 
As every cell in Chile will tell 
The cries of the tortured men 
Remember Allende, and the days before, 
Before the army came 
Please remember Victor Jara, 
In the Santiago Stadium, 
Es verdad those Washington Bullets again 
 
And in the Bay of Pigs in 1961, 
Havana fought the playboy in the Cuban sun, 
For Castro is a colour, 
Is a redder than red, 
Those Washington bullets want Castro dead 
For Castro is the colour... 
...That will earn you a spray of lead 
 
For the very first time ever, 
When they had a revolution in Nicaragua, 
There was no interference from America 
Human rights in America 
 
Well the people fought the leader, 
And up he flew... 
With no Washington bullets what else could he do? 
 
'N' if you can find a Afghan rebel 
That the Moscow bullets missed 
Ask him what he thinks of voting Communist... 
...Ask the Dalai Lama in the hills of Tibet, 
How many monks did the Chinese get? 
In a war torn swamp stop any mercenary, 
'N' check the British bullets in his armoury 
Que? 
Sandinista!

Midnight to six man 
For the first time from Jamaica 
Dillinger and Leroy Smart 
Delroy Wilson, your cool operator 
 
Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae 
With backing bands sound systems 
And if they've got anything to say 
There's many black ears here to listen 
 
But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right 
Charging from the bass knives to the treble 
But onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel 
Onstage they ain't got no...roots rock rebel 
 
Dress back jump back this is a bluebeat attack 
'Cos it won't get you anywhere 
Fooling with your guns 
The British Army is waiting out there 
An' it weighs fifteen hundred tons 
 
White youth, black youth 
Better find another solution 
Why not phone up Robin Hood 
And ask him for some wealth distribution 
 
Punk rockers in the UK 
They won't notice anyway 
They're all too busy fighting 
For a good place under the lighting 
 
The new groups are not concerned 
With what there is to be learned 
They got Burton suits, ha you think it's funny 
Turning rebellion into money 
 
All over people changing their votes 
Along with their overcoats 
If Adolf Hitler flew in today 
They'd send a limousine anyway 
 
I'm the all night drug prowling wolf 
Who looks so sick in the sun 
I'm the white man in the Palais 
Just lookin' for fun 
 
I'm only 
Looking for fun

Along with their overcoats 
If Adolf Hitler flew in today 
They'd send a limousine anyway 
 
I'm the all night drug prowling wolf 
Who looks so sick in the sun 
I'm the white man in the Palais 
Just lookin' for fun 
 
I'm only 
Looking for fun 


 

CLASH (THE)
WHITE MAN IN HAMMERSMITH PALAIS

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
Midnight to six man 
For the first time from Jamaica 
Dillinger and Leroy Smart 
Delroy Wilson, your cool operator 
 
Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae 
With backing bands sound systems 
And if they've got anything to say 
There's many black ears here to listen 
 
But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right 
Charging from the bass knives to the treble 
But onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel 
Onstage they ain't got no...roots rock rebel 
 
Dress back jump back this is a bluebeat attack 
'Cos it won't get you anywhere 
Fooling with your guns 
The British Army is waiting out there 
An' it weighs fifteen hundred tons 
 
White youth, black youth 
Better find another solution 
Why not phone up Robin Hood 
And ask him for some wealth distribution 
 
Punk rockers in the UK 
They won't notice anyway 
They're all too busy fighting 
For a good place under the lighting 
 
The new groups are not concerned 
With what there is to be learned 
They got Burton suits, ha you think it's funny 
Turning rebellion into money 
 
All over people changing their votes 
Along with their overcoats 
If Adolf Hitler flew in today 
They'd send a limousine anyway 
 
I'm the all night drug prowling wolf 
Who looks so sick in the sun 
I'm the white man in the Palais 
Just lookin' for fun 
 
I'm only 
Looking for fun 


 

CLASH (THE)
WHITE RIOT

 (Strummer/Jones) 
 
White riot I wanna riot 
White riot a riot of my own 
White riot I wanna riot 
White riot a riot of my own 
 
Black people gotta lot a problems 
But they don't mind throwing a brick 
White people go to school 
Where they teach you how to be thick 
 
An' everybody's doing 
Just what they're told to 
An' nobody wants 
To go to jail! 
 
All the power's in the hands 
Of people rich enough to buy it 
While we walk the street 
Too chicken to even try it 
 
Everybody's doing 
Just what they're told to 
Nobody wants 
To go to jail! 
 
Are you taking over 
or are you taking orders? 
Are you going backwards 
Or are you going forwards?

CLASH (THE)
WRONG 'EM BOYO

 (C. Alphanso) 
 
Stagger Lee met Billy and they go down to gambling 
Stagger Lee throwed seven 
Billy said that he throwed eight 
So Billy said, hey Stagger! I'm gonna make my big attack 
I'm gonna have to leave my knife in your back 
 
Why do you try to cheat? 
And trample people under your feet 
Don't you know it is wrong? 
To cheat the trying man 
So you better stop, it is the wrong 'em boyo 
 
You lie, steal, cheat and deceit 
In such a small, small game 
Don't you know it is wrong 
 
Billy Boy has been shot 
And Stagger Lee's come out on top 
Don't you know it is wrong 
To cheat the trying man 
To cheat Stagger man 
You'd better stop 
So you must start all over again all over again 
You got to play it, Billy, play, you got to play it, Billy, play 
And you will find it is the right 'em boyo 
 
But if you must lie and deceit 
And trample people under your feet 
Don't you know it is wrong 
It is the wrong 'em boyo
