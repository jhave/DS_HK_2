1942

 I'm a Russian Jew American 
Impersonating African Jamaican What I want to be is an Indian 
I'm gonna be a cowboy in the end 
I guess I bought a gun 
because it impresses all the little girls I see 
and then they all wanna sleep with me 
Oh where did we disappear 
into the silence that surrounds us and then drowns us in the end 
Where these people who impersonate our friends 
Say come again come again come again 
Into the dark Italian underground 
with disco lights and disco sounds and skinny 
girls who drink champagne 
Then they take me on their knees again, 
and pull me up and out the door 
past railway cars and tranny whores 
And mornings spreading out across the feathered thighs of angels 
Oh were did we disappear to 
the silence that surrounds us and then drowns us in the end 
Will they try to get you out to pull you in 
And all these people, they've been? come again 
In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue 
In 1493 he came home across the deep blue sea 
In 1494 he did it with the girl next door 
In 1495 he barely made it out alive 
In 1964 ???? busting out the door 
In 1970 some people got their hands on me 
Now I am the king of everything 
I am the king of nothing now 
I am the king of everything 
I am the king of nothing 
Oh where did we disappear 
to the silence that surrounds us and then drowns us in the end Where these people 
who impersonate our friends Say come again come again come 
come again Oh where did we disappear 
to the silence that surrounds us and then drowns us in the end When they try to push you out to get you in 
and all these people who impersonate our friends Say come again come again come 
come again come again come again

40 YEARS

 I was born in the jungle 
With the sickening smell of cinnamon in the air 
I was born in a white hole and I can't believe the colors here today 
Stalk on a circle 
Well I've never been blessed with elephant's memory 
Riding a red line nowhere 
If it takes 40 years for the gun to be paid for 
If it takes 40 years I'll put the money away 
If it takes 40 years to get the things that I need sir 
If it takes 40 years I'll walk the thunder and the rain 
I was born in a good home 
Where the rising cost of raising children 
Was not a factor and you can't believe the things it does to me 
I'm filled with the white noise 
Well I never did much of anything anyway 
Jump on a big train no where 
[CHORUS] 
I wanna buy me a good heart, and a conscience, 
and maybe raise some children 
I wanna get me a good wife, 
and a garden, garden, garden, garden. 
Wanna start me a new life with a six foot color television 
Wanna start me a new life somewhere. 
I was born on a warm night 
On the right coast, of southeastern America. 
Dead on arrival, but you can't believe the things you hear today. 
I'll fly me a white plane over 
water over blue and green and land in the ocean somewhere.

 She said, 
 I wanna be the rain, I am a red balloon, I got a book of dates. 
She's gonna go away and leave me here tonight 
Some worlds last longer then others 
She's got a red balloon, she's gonna be the sky, 
I'm gonna paint my face tonight 
Hey 99 days out of San Francisco 
Headed for Berlin 
Hey 99 days left of California 
Headed with the wind 
If I sail across the water, I'll be floating blind, here beside the wild 
Monkey came alive, she's leaving me behind 
It's so hard to find 
She said, 
 I wanna be a plane, I am a red balloon, I'll never be the same 
And I'm gone, gone, gone on the wind. 
She said, 
 You'll never get away, you need a red balloon, you need a better day. 
This time, your headed home this time. 
Some trips last longer then others, she just said, Good bye. 
She just float away, I'm gonna die right here this time 
Some girls last longer then others, 
too few red balloons, too little time tonight 
Hey 99 days out San Francisco 
Headed for Berlin 
Hey 99 days left of California 
Setting with the wind, home

A GOOD YEAR FOR THE ROSES

 (by George Jones) 
 
I can hardly stand the sight of lipstick 
on the cigarettes there in the ashtray. 
Lying cold the way you left them, 
but at least your lips caressed them 
while you packed. 
Or the lip print on a half filled cup 
of coffee that you poured 
and didn't drink. 
But at least you thought you wanted it 
which is so much more than I can say for me. 
REFRAIN 
It's been a good year for the roses 
Many blooms still linger there. 
The lawn could stand another mowing 
it's funny, I don't even care 
But as you turned and walked away 
As the door behind you closes 
The only thing I thought to say 
was what a good year for the roses 
After three, four years of marriage 
it's the first time that you haven't made the bed 
I guess the reason we're not talking, 
is there's so little left to say that we haven't said 
While a million thoughts go racing through my mind 
I guess I haven't said a word 
From the bedroom, the familiar sound 
of our one baby's crying goes unheard

A LITTLE DISCIPLINE

 This time is better than last time 
I feel better today 
A little discipline can lock you up inside 
This time I think you shed a little light 
I feel better today 
A little discipline can bring you down sometimes 
This time I got some other ideas 
But I don't want them to hear 
No, I don't want them to hear 
And it may not seem like a sensible scheme 
But I think I'd really like to die 
Into the pit of my desire or a bed of fire tonight 
 Oh no, this is the last time, 
honey she whispers in my ear 
But every time I look at her she disappears 
Ahh, this time is better than last time 
I feel better today 
And the music can plays and the elevator sways 
But I don't really feel like dancing' 
Because elevator dreams never really have much of a beat 
She says, Oh no, this is the last time, 
honey, we just wanna calm you down. 
You have nothing to fear, 
we will get you out of here. 
But every time I look at her she disappears 
Oh, this time is better than last time 
I feel better today 
A little discipline can twist you inside out 
This time I think you busted the bubble 
And I feel much better today 
A little discipline can mess you up inside 
This time I feel I need a little lift 
And I feel like I am a razor 
And I feel like I am a razor 
And the TV pans and the elephants dance 
And the nurse looks like she's angry 
So the pills slide down in the septic town tonight 
She says Bad boy, just like the last time, 
honey and bites me on the ear 
But when I turn to look at her she disappears 
Oh, this time I think you shed a little light 
I feel much better today 
And the elevator dreams with the hobby horse scream 
I feel like I'm going' home 
But the nurse says Son, you're going' nowhere tonight 
She says Oh no, this is the last time 
sonny, we're gonna have to tie you down 
'cause you gotta see clear to be getting out of here 
But then every time I look at her she disappears 
Oh, this time I feel a little bit... 
But I feel better today 
A little discipline can take you out sometime 
This time, I feel I might be better 
I feel much, much better today 
A little discipline can turn you inside out 
This time I think you shed a little light 
I feel better today 
A little discipline can fuck you up inside 
This time I feel a little foggy 
A little discipline can weigh you down sometimes 
I'm dreaming, underground 
A little discipline can suffocate your mind 
This time, I'm flying home 
A little discipline can drive you into the ground 
This time I think you shed a little light 
I feel much better today 
A little discipline can lock you up inside 
A little discipline can lock you up

A LONG DECEMBER

 A long December and there's reason to believe 
Maybe this year will be better than the last 
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin' 
Now the days go by so fast 
And it's one more day up in the canyons 
And it's one more night in Hollywood 
If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would 
The smell of hospitals in winter 
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls 
All at once you look across a crowded room 
To see the way that light attaches to a girl 
And it's one more day up in the canyons 
And it's one more night in Hollywood 
If you think you might come to California...I think you should 
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m. 
And talked a little while about the year 
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower, 
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her 
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe 
Maybe this year will be better than the last 
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself 
To hold on to these moments as they pass 
And it's one more day up in the canyon 
And it's one more night in Hollywood 
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...I guess I should

A MURDER OF ONE

 Blue morning Blue morning Wrapped in strands of fist and bone 
Curiosity, Kitten, 
Doesn't have to mean you're on your own 
You can look outside your window 
He doesn't have to know 
We can talk awhile, baby 
We can take it nice and slow 
All your life is such a shame, shame, shame 
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream 
Are you happy where you're sleeping? 
Does he keep you safe and warm? 
Does he tell you when you're sorry?

I've been watching you for hours 
It's been years since we were born 
We were perfect when we started 
I've been wondering where we've gone 
All your life is such a shame shame shame 
All your love is just a dream dream dream 
I dreamt I saw you walking up a hillside in the snow 
Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there 
counting crows 
One for sorrow Two for joy 
Three for girls and four for boys 
Five for silver Six for gold and 
seven for a secret never to be told 
There's a bird that nests inside you 
sleeping underneath your skin 
When you open up your wings to speak 
I wish you'd let me in 
All your life is such a shame shame shame 
All your love is just a dream dream dream 
Open up your eyes 
You can see the flames flames flames of your wasted life 
You should be ashamed 
You don't want to waste your life baby 
I walk along these hillsides in the summer 'neath the sunshine 
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me 
Change, change, change

ACCIDENTALLY IN LOVE

 So she said what's the problem baby 
What's the problem I don't know 
Well maybe I'm in love (love) 
Think about it every time 
I think about it 
Can't stop thinking 'bout it 
 
How much longer will it take to cure this 
Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love) 
Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love 
 
Come on, come on 
Turn a little faster 
Come on, come on 
The world will follow after 
Come on, come on 
Cause everybody's after love 
 
So I said I'm a snowball running 
Running down into the spring that's coming all this love 
Melting under blue skies 
Belting out sunlight 
Shimmering love 
 
Well baby I surrender 
To the strawberry ice cream 
Never ever end of all this love 
Well I didn't mean to do it 
But there's no escaping your love 
 
These lines of lightning 
Mean we're never alone, 
Never alone, no, no 
 
Come on, Come on 
Move a little closer 
Come on, Come on 
I want to hear you whisper 
Come on, Come on 
Settle down inside my love 
 
Come on, come on 
Jump a little higher 
Come on, come on 
If you feel a little lighter 
Come on, come on 
We were once 
Upon a time in love 
 
We're accidentally in love

ALL MY FRIENDS

 Thought I might get a rocket ride 
When I was a child but it was a lie 
That I told myself when I needed something good 
At seventeen, had a better dream. 
Now I'm thirty three and it isn't me 
But I'd think of something better if I could 
All my friends and lovers leave me behind 
I'm still looking for a girl 
One way or another 
I'm just hoping to find a way 
To put my feet out in the world 
Caught some grief from a falling leaf 
As she tumbled down to the dirty ground 
Said I should have put her back there if I could 
But everyone needs a better day 
And I'm trying to find me a better way 
To get from the things I do to the things I should 
All my friends and lovers leave me alone 
To try to have a little fun 
One way or another I just wish I had known 
To go out walking in the sun 
And find out if you were the one 
Does it make you wanna come a little closer now? 
And did you wanna dance with me? 
Did you wanna hum a little harder now? 
Can you see her waiting there? 
Can you see her? Because I'm almost there 
Can you see her waiting there for someone like me? 
All you want is a beauty queen 
Not a superstar but everybody's dream machine 
All you want is a place to lay your head 
You go to sleep dreaming how you would 
Be a different kind if you thought you could 
But you come awake the way you are instead 
All my friends and lovers shine like the sun 
I just turn and walk away 
One way or another 
I'm not coming undone 
I'm just waiting for the day

ANGELS OF THE SILENCES

 Well I guess you left me with some feathers in my hand 
Did it make it any easier to leave me where I stand? 
I guess there might not be too many who would stand beside you now 
Where'd you come from? Where am I going? 
Why'd you leave me 'till I'm only good for... 
Waiting for you 
All my sins... 
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you 
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming 
Every night these silhouettes appear above my head 
Little angels of the silences that climb into my bed and whisper 
Every time I fall asleep Every time I dream 
 Did you come? Would you lie? 
Why'd you leave us 'till we're only good for... 
Waiting for you 
All my sins... 
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you 
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming 
I dream of Michelangelo when I'm lying in my bed 
Little angels hang above my head and read me like an open book 
Suck my blood break my nerve offer me their arms 
Well, I will not be an enemy of anything 
I'll only stand here 
Waiting for you 
All my sins... 
I said that I would pay for them if I could come back to you 
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

ANNA BEGINS

 My friend assures me it's all or nothing 
I am not worried I am not overly concerned 
My friend implores me for one time only, 
make an exception. I am not not worried 
Wrap her up in a package of lies 
Send her off to a coconut island 
I am not worried I am not overly concerned 
with the status of my emotions 
 oh , She says, you're changing. 
But we're always changing 
It does not bother me to say this isn't love 
Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love 
and I guess I'm going to have to live with that 
but, I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray 
or something in between 
and I can always change my name if that's what you mean 
My friend assures me it's all or nothing 
But I am not really worried 
I am not overly concerned 
You try to tell yourself the things you try tell yourself to make 
yourself forget 
to make yourself forget 
I am not worried 
 If it's love she said, then we're gonna have to think about the 
consequences 
cause she can't stop shaking and I can't stop touching her and..... 
This time when kindness falls like rain 
it washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind 
 these seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering 
for days she says. 
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing 
But I'm not gonna break 
And I'm not going to worry about it anymore 
I'm not gonna bend. And I'm not gonna break and 
I'm not gonna worry about it anymore 
It seems like I should say as long as this is love... 
But it's not all that easy so maybe I should just 
snap her up in a butterfly net 
Pin her down on a photograph album 
I am not worried 
I've done this sort of thing before 
But then I start to think about the consequences 
Because I don't get no sleep in a quiet room and... 
The time when kindness falls like rain 
it washes me away and Anna begins change my mind 
And every time she sneezes I believe it's love 
and oh lord.... I'm not ready for this sort of thing 
She's talking in her sleep it's keeping me awake 
And Anna begins to toss and turn 
And every word is nonsense but I understand and 
oh lord. I m not ready for this sort of thing 
Her kindness bangs a gong 
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away 
It's chasing me away. She dissappears, and oh lord I'm not ready for this sort of thing

ANOTHER'S HORSEDREAMER'S BLUES

 Margery's dreaming of the middle of the day 
Tiyuri to win 
Perfect Dozen to place 
money is the matter that's been on her mind 
time ticks by her one race at a time 
She's tryin' to be a good girl 
And give 'em what they want 
But Margery's dreaming of horses 
Lookin' at a green sky 
Sun like a red eye 
Bright blue horses are the fortune she lives by 
She's tired and lonely 
Scared and depressed 
Her visions of one day go racing the next 
She's trying to be a good girl 
And give 'em what they want 
But Margery's dreaming of horses 
Margie doesn't say anything all the way home 
So afraid she'll awake to find she's all alone 
Margery's wingspan's all feathers and coke cans, and 
TV dinners and letters she won't send, and 
Every race night is shot through with sunlight 
Trying to hit the big one one last time tonight for... 
Drunken fathers and stupid mothers and 
Boys who can't tell one girl from another 
So she takes her pills 
Careful and round 
One of these days she's gonna throw the whole bottle down 
But she's trying to be a good girl 
And give 'em what they want 
But Margery's dreaming of... 
Trying to be a good girl 
And give 'em what they want 
But Margery's dreaming of horses

ATLANTIC CITY

 (by Bruce Springsteen) 
 
Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly 
last night now they blew up his house too 
Down on the boardwalk 
they're gettin' ready for a fight 
gonna see what them racket boys can do 
Now there's trouble busin' 
in from outta state and the D.A. 
can't get no relief 
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade 
and the gamblin' commission's hangin' on by 
the skin of its teeth 
(Chorus) 
Well now everything dies baby that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty 
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away 
But I got debts that no honest man can pay 
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust 
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus 
(Chorus) 
Now our luck may have died 
and our love may be cold 
but with you forever I'll stay 
We're goin' out 
where the sand's turnin' to gold 
so put on your stockin's baby cause 
the night's getting cold 
And everything dies baby that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
Now I been lookin' for a job 
but it's hard to find 
Down here it's just winners and losers 
and don't get caught on the wrong side of that 
line 
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end 
So honey last night I met this guy and 
I'm gonna do a little favor for him 
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact 
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
Put your hair up nice and set up pretty 
and meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City

AUGUST AND EVERYTHING AFTER

 They're wakin' up Mama ' 
cause everybody else has got 
She makes a little action with her head. 
Rolls over And she says she's gonna 
sleep for a couple of minutes more 
I've said I'm sorry to Maria for the 
cold hear I've said 
 I'm sorry , by now, at once to j 
She says, I've forgotten what I'm supposed to do 
And it slips my mind what 
I'm supposed to say? 
I'm getting older and older and older 
And always a little farther out of the 
way You look into her eyes and it's 
more than you hear 
In August and Everything After, 
you get a little 
I stumbled into Washington Square just as the sun 
b 
I walked across the lawn 
to the cathedral and lay down 
in the shadow of 
St. 
I'm just one of three late model 
children waiting for the king 
But there ain't no sign of 
Elvis in San Fransisco It's just me, 
and 
I'm playing this rock and roll thing 
She wants to be just like me 
I want every damn thing 
I can see. 
One day you're Daddy's little angel, 
Next day you're everything he wanted you to be 
They dress you up in white satin 
And they give you your very own pair of wings 
In August and everything after, I'm after everything

BABIES

 After you're gone, babies 
ride the soft machine 
threading the warm children 
down the space between 
into a slow heaven 
hanging by a thread 
leaving the still living 
for the walking dead 
It took so long 
to find my way out of here 
out of the warm night, to the hard light 
shivering with fear 
After you're gone, babies 
crawling on the world 
touching the souls of all the lonely 
carefree boys and girls 
daddy needs you 
mamma feeds you 
and they come until they go 
but if I'm lonely, I'm the only one who knows 
It took so long 
to find my way out of here 
out of the warm night, to the hard light 
shivering with fear 
after the slow lonely waiting 
I'm all alone, alone and free 
If you see me, please believe me 
I wannna be 
After you're gone, babies 
screaming at the rain 
hanging a slow heaven 
in the wind again 
She's been waiting 
270 days 
sick of waiting 
when you see me 
please believe me 
I'm the only one who cares at all 
[chorus] 
After the slow lonely heaven 
I'm all alone, alone and free 
if you see me 
please believe me 
I wanna be 
After you're gone...

BABY BLUE

 (by Badfinger) 
 
Guess I got what I deserve, 
Kept you waiting there, too long my love 
All that time, without a word, 
Didn't know you'd think, that I'd forget, or I'd regret 
The special love I have for you, my baby blue 
All the days became so long, 
Did you really think, I'd do you wrong 
Dixie, when I let you go, 
Thought you'd realize, that I would know, I would show 
The special love I have for you, my baby blue 
What can I do, what can I say 
except that I want you by my side 
How can I show, you, show me a way 
Don't you know, the times I tried (solo) 
Guess that's all I have to say, 
Except the feeling just gets stronger everyday 
Just one thing, before I go 
Take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow 
The special love, you have for me, my Dixie dear

BABY, I'M A BIG STAR NOW

 Gonna get out on the road tonight 
Cause, I got a hollow in my head 
Checking it up 
Baby, one more time for you 
Checking it up 
Until the pot hits the sky 
It's like I think 
I'm sick of cocaine 
Got a feeling like 
It's running in my veins 
Checking it up 
Baby, one more time for you 
Checking it up 
Until the pot hits the sky 
Even the best years 
Leave a lot to be desired 
When they pass you by 
All these seasons 
All this time 
Spinning round 
Until they leave you 
Far behind 
Lay me down in the circle 
Where the spotlight shines 
All this pleasure gets me high 
Some people will cut you 
Until you're bleeding 
But not me 
I just want to do it to myself 
Checking it up 
Baby, one more time for you 
Checking it up 
Until the pot hits the sky 
Even the best years 
Are a waste of time 
But, Baby, I'm a big star now 
All these seasons 
All this time 
Spinning round 
Until they leave you 
Far behind 
Lay me down in the circle 
Where the spotlight shines 
All this pleasure gets me high 
All these seasons 
All this time 
Spinning round 
Until they leave you 
Far behind 
Lay me down in the circle 
Where the spotlight shines 
Turn your back back on the people 
Who draw the line 
Put your faith in the answers 
That you can find 
Hit the Ground hard running down 
That highway line 
Say a prayer for the ones 
You have left behind 
All this pleasure gets them high 
I don't want to give it back...

BAD TIME

 (by Grand Funk Railroad) 
 
I'm in love with a girl 
I'm talking about 
I'm in love with a girl I cant live without 
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love 
Let her be somebody else's queen 
I don't want to know about it 
too many others who know what I mean 
that's why I got to live without it 
said I'm in love with a girl 
I'm talking about 
I'm in love with a girl 
I cant live without 
I'm in love 
but I feel like I'm wearing it out 
I'm in love 
but I must have picked a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love 
The story is coming back to me 
from my friends and the people I don't want to see 
The things they're saying I know just couldn't be true 
at least not until I hear it from you 
cause I love a little girl 
I'm talking about 
I'm in love with a girl 
I can't live without 
I'm in love 
but I feel like I'm wearing it out 
i'm in love 
but I must have picked a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love 
a bad time to be in love

BARELY OUT OF TUESDAY

 Woke up to this morning 
staring at the ceiling 
hoping for deliverance 
from the distances in you. 
this room feels like an oven 
somewhere south of no where 
north of nothing 
barely out of Tuesday 
seen seven hours of Wednesday 
And I guess got regrets 
maybe you could leave a light on 
leave a light on for me 
can you see her waiting 
there down by the sea 
with a hat on, 
with her eyes in there looking for me. 
if you see me coming home turn me away 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday 
Wont you give me the distance 
52 weeks later, your still the same 
I'm standing im my basement 
making my arrangements 
waiting for the telephone 
to ring 
to ring 
to ring 
So I left for Minnesota 
where the weather is getting colder 
people are changing 
maybe you could leave a light on 
leave a light on for me 
can you see her 
waiting there down by the sea 
& how arrangements made there for welcoming me? 
if you see me coming home turn me away 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday 
And for all this distance aint going to bring you to me 
what's the point of all this patience 
its not your nature 
you just keep what you need 
and you got some pictures of me 
woke up Wendsday morning 
sometime Wednesday evening 
hoping for a piece of 
something easy to believe 
we live out on the border 
of everything and nothing 
theres nothing but waking and dreaming 
barely out of tuesday 
theres no one to receive me 
nothing is changing 
maybe you could leave a light on 
leave a light on for me 
can you see her 
waiting there down by the sea 
there's a light on but there's no body waiting for me. 
if you see me coming home turn me away 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday 
everybody tries to go back somewhere someday 
everybody tries to go back somewhere...

 Fading everything to black and blue 
You look a lot like you 
Shatter in the blink of an eye 
You keep sailing right on through 
Every time you say you're learning 
You just look a lot like me 
Pale under the blistering sky 
White and red 
Black and blue 
You've been waiting a long time 
You've been waiting a long time 
To fall down on your knees 
Cut your hands 
Cut yourself until you bleed 
Fall asleep next to me 
Wait for everyone to go away 
And in a dimly lit 
room where you've got nothing to hide 
Say your goodbyes 
Tell yourself we'll read 
a note that says 
I'm sorry everyone 
I'm tired of feeling nothing goodbye 
Wash your face 
Dry your eyes 
Cause you've been waiting a long time 
You've been waiting a long long time 
To fall down on your knees 
Cut your hands 
Cut yourself until you bleed 
But fall asleep next to me 
Have a dream I'm falling down 
On my face 
Scrape my knees 
Scrape my hands until they bleed 
Cause you're fast asleep next to me 
Next to me [3X]

BLUE EYES CRYING IN THE RAIN

 (by Willie Nelson) 
 
In the twilight glow I see her 
Blue eyes crying in the rain 
When we kissed goodbye and parted 
I knew we'd never meet again 
Love is like a dying ember 
Only memories remain 
Through the ages I remember 
Blue eyes crying in the rain 
Someday when we meet up yonder 
We'll stroll hand in hand again 
In a land that knows no parting 
Blue eyes crying in the rain 
Blue eyes crying in the rain 
Blue eyes crying in the rain 
Blue eyes crying in the rain

BUTTERFLY IN REVERSE

 Maryann you're better than the world 
They took a lot of time getting it right on this girl 
I said Maryann you're better than the world 
They did a lot of things right on this girl 
I had a lot of girlfriends 
I should have known them 
Click your heels and count back from three 
Do you want to go back 
You should have known that 
The butterfly in reverse here is me 
Maryann you're better than the world 
They took a lot of time getting it right on this girl 
I said Maryann you're better than the world 
They did a lot of things right on this girl 
Where'd you want to go to 
with nothing beside you 
But webbing and curfews and rain 
And everything that hurts you 
Gets stuffed up inside you 
Like butterflies with wings 
or other perfect things 
We go swimming in the sunshine 
Dangling from clotheslines 
Seperate and fall into me 
And did you ever see me 
Me absolutely 
Me but all you but still me 
Maryann you're better than the world 
They took a lot of time getting it right on this girl 
I said Maryann you're better than the world 
They did a lot of things right on this girl did alot of things right on this [2X] 
did alot of things right on this girl

CARAVAN

 (by Van Morrison) 
 
And the caravan is on its way 
I can hear the merry gypsies play 
Mama, Mama, oh will you never run away? 
She laughs playing with her radio 
La la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la 
And the caravan has all my friends 
And they will stay with me until the end 
Gypsies robbing sleep in the road 
Tell me everything I need to know 
La la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la 
Turn up your radio 
Let me hear your song 
Switch on your electric light 
So we can get down to what is really wrong 
Because I long just to hold you tight 
So that I can feel you 
Sweet lady, oh Mother Night 
I shall revere you 
Turn it up 
Turn it up 
Little bit higher radio 
Turn it up

CARMELITA

 (by Warren Zevon) 
 
I hear mariachi static on my radio 
And the tubes, they glow in the dark 
And I'm there with you in Ensenada 
And I'm here in Echo Park 
Carmelita, hold me tighter. 
I think I'm sinkin' down. 
And I'm all strung out on heroin 
on the outskirts of town. 
Well, I pawned my Smith and Wesson, 
and I went to meet my man. 
He hangs out down on Alvarado Street, 
at the Pioneer Chicken stand 
(back to chorus) 
Well, I'm sittin' here playin' solitaire 
with my pearl handled deck. 
The county won't give me no more methadone 
and they cut off your welfare check 
(back to chorus)

CARRIAGE

 If anything 
it should have been 
a better thing 
From underneath you 
staring at the ceiling 
There's another world 
of chocolate bars and baseball cards 
That hides inside of all 
this tension that I'm feeling 
But It's all inside of you 
Yeah, it's all inside of you 
Surprise surprise 
I miss your hair, you miss my eyes 
And all this solitude 
is my confidence eroding 
So we slide inside of 
someone's mouth and someone's eyes 
Until there's a sound 
of something intimate exploding 
But it's all inside of you 
Yeah, it's all inside of you [3X] I wish that I was anesthetized 
and sterilized and then 
we wouldn't have this evidence congealing 
Surprise surprise, 
another pair of lips and eyes 
And that is the consequence 
of actually feeling 
It was all inside of you [4X]

CATAPULT

 All of the sudden she disappears 
just yesterday she was here 
somebody tell me if I am sleeping 
someone should be with me here 
(cause I don't wanna be alone) 
I wanna be the knife that cuts into my hand 
and I wanna be scattered from here in this catapult 
What a big baby won't somebody save me please 
You won't find nobody home 
all of these quiet battered voices 
wait for the hunger to come 
we got little revolvers and stupid choices 
and no one to say when we're done 
(Well I don't wanna bring you down) 
I wanna be the light that burns out your eyes 
 cause I know there's little things about me 
that would sing in the silence of so much rejection 
in every connection I make 
I can't find nobody home 
I wanna be the last thing you hear when you're falling asleep....

CHELSEA

 I never go to New York City these days 
Something about the buildings in Chelsea just kills me 
Maybe in a month or two, 
Maybe when things are different for me, 
Maybe when things are different for you 
You know all of this shit, just sticks in my head 
Is there anything different these days? 
The light in her eyes goes out 
I never had light in my eyes anyway 
Maybe things are different these days 
It's good for everybody to hurt somebody once in a while 
The things I do to people I love shouldn't be allowed 
Something about the buildings in Chelsea just kills me

Angels flow down from all the buildings 
Something about an angel just kills me 
I keep hoping something will

CIGARETTES AND ALCOHOL

 (by Oasis) 
 
Is it my imagination 
or have I finally found 
something worth living for? 
I was looking for some action 
but all I found was cigarettes and alcohol 
You could wait for a lifetime 
to spend your days in the sunshine 
You might as well do the white line 
cos when it comes on top . . . 
You've gotta make it happen! 
You gotta make it happen 
You gotta make it happen 
You gotta make it happen 
Is it worth the aggravation 
to find yourself a job 
when there's nothing worth working for? 
It's a crazy situation 
but all I need are cigarettes and alcohol 
You could wait for a lifetime 
to spend your days in the sunshine 
You might as well do the white line 
cos when it comes on top . . . 
You've gotta make it happen! 
You've gotta make it happen! 
You gotta make it happen! 
You gotta make it happen! 
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it 
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fake it 
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it

COME PICK ME UP

 (by Ryan Adams) 
 
When they call your name 
will you walk right up 
with a smile on your face? 
Or will you cower in fear 
in your favorite sweater 
with an old love letter? 
I wish you would 
I wish you would 
Come pick me up 
Take me out 
Fuck me up 
Steal my records 
Screw all my friends 
They're all full of shit 
With a smile on your face 
And then do it again 
I wish you would 
When you're walking downtown 
do you wish I was there? 
Do you wish it was me? 
With the windows clear and the mannequins eyes 
Do they all look like mine? 
You know you could 
I wish you would 
Come pick me up 
Take me out 
Fuck me up 
Steal my records 
Screw all my friends behind my back 
With a smile on your face 
and then do it again 
I wish you would 
I wish you'd make up my bed 
So I could make up my mind 
Try it for sleeping instead 
Maybe you'll rest sometime 
I wish I could

CROSSING MUDDY WATERS

 (by John Hiatt) 
 
My baby's gone and I don't know why 
She let out this morning 
like a rusty shot in a hollow sky 
Left me without warning 
sooner than the dogs could bark 
and faster than the sun rose 
Down to the banks in an old mule car 
she took a flatboat across the shallow 
CHORUS: 
Left me in my tears to drown 
she left a baby daughter 
Now the water's wide and deep and brown 
She's crossing muddy waters 
Tobacco standing in the fields 
be rotten come November 
And a bitter heart will not reveal 
a spring that love remembers 
When that sweet brown girl of mine her black eyes are ravens 
We broke the bread and drank the wine 
from a jug that she'd been saving 
REPEAT CHORUS 
Baby's crying and the daylight's gone 
That big oak tree is groaning 
In rush of wind and river of song 
I can hear my sweetheart moaning 
Crying for her baby child 
or crying for her husband 
Crying for that river's wild 
to take her from her loved ones 
REPEAT CHORUS TWICE

DANCING DAYS

 (by Led Zeppelin) 
 
Dancing days are here again 
As the summer evenings grow 
I got my flower, I got my power 
I got a woman who knows. 
CHORUS 
 
I said it's alright 
You know it's alright 
I guess it's all in my heart 
 
You'll be my only, my one and only 
Is that the way it should start? 
Crazy ways are evident 
In the way that you're wearing your clothes 
Suppin' boze is precedent 
As the evening starts to glow. 
CHORUS 
I told your mamma I'd get you home 
But I didn't tell her I had no car 
I saw a lion he was standing alone 
With a tadpole in a jar. 
CHORUS 
Dancing days are here again 
As the summer evening grows 
You are my flower, you are my power 
You are my woman who knows.

DAYLIGHT FADING

 Waiting for the moon to come and light me up inside 
And I am waiting for the telephone to tell me I'm alive 
Well I heard you let somebody get their fingers into you 
It's getting cold in California 
I guess I'll be leaving soon 
Daylight fading 
Come and waste another year 
All the the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear 
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn 
When we see the early signs that daylight's fading 
We leave just before it's gone 
She said everybody loves you, 
she says, everybody cares 
But all the things I keep inside myself 
they vanish in the air 
If you tell me that you'll wait for me 
I'll say I won't be here 
I want to say goodbye to you 
Goodbye to all my friends 
Goodbye to everyone I know 
Daylight fading 
Come and waste another year 
All the the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear 
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn

 Sunday morning paper dated 1992 
There are cowboys in my kitchen 
empty bottles on the roof 
I've been trying to quit these cigarettes 
I've been trying to think its true 
Maybe she's gone to California 
maybe Ill go out there too 
Daylight fading come and waste another year 
all the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear 
moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn 
when she sees the early signs of daylight fading 
she leaves just before its gone 
Daddy's on the rooftop with his fingers in 
the gun and I am waiting at the window I am 
waiting for the one 
Shying in that paper when she walked into my room I said I want to 
say good bye to you good bye to all my friends good bye to everyone I know

FLESH NUMBER ONE

There's a house burning down on the radio, but 
We're in luck, we don't mind, we're as far as I can tell 
Everyone worries so much about themselves 
There's nothing happening to you that means anything at all 
There's a plane crashing down on the studio, but 
We're in luck, we're not there, so we're somewhere else instead 
Everyone wishes so much upon themselves 
There's not a thing that you can do that'll make me come again 
There's a house burning down on the radio, but 
We're in love, we don't mind, we're as far as I can tell

 Getting dressed and bunger bound 
shuffling through the heather 
neighbors drop their flowers down and worry about the weather 
every night I'm floating over you my love 
every night I dream I'm under you 
All the smiling hands delivering all the ??? 
All of the smiling men with suede hands delivering with those pensions 
wont you please except our sympathy into three dimensions 
every night I'M floating over you my love 
every night I'm drifting under you 
Don't want to think about my last cigarette 
don't want to focus on the curve of your thigh 
don't want to slip off your white silhouette 
I don't think this is a very sensible way to die. 
Lonely lonely lonely 
Lonely lonely lonely 
Lonely lonely lonely 
Lonely lonely lonely 
Every night I'M floating over you my love 
every night I dream I'm under you 
Well I'm alter bound and under dressed 
just slightly out of order hanging on the fringe of daylights 
soft and pitchy border. 
Every night I'm floating over you my love 
every night I'm slipping under you 
Every night I'm floating over you my love

I'm not the one 
to tenderly bring 
her soft sympathy 
I've just begun 
to see my way clear 
and it's plain, 
if I stop I will fall 
I can lay down a tear 
for her pain, 
just a tear and that's all. 
 
What does she want me to do? 
she says that she knows 
that moments are rare 
I suppose that it's true 
then on she goes 
to say I don't care, 
and she knows 
that I do 
 
Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song 
and who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong. 
 
She'd like to think that I'm cruel, 
but she knows that's a lie 
for I would be 
no more than a tool 
if I allowed her to cry 
all over me. 
 
Oh my sorrow is real 
even though 
I can't change my plan 
If she could see how I feel 
then I know 
that she'd understand 
 
Oh does she actually think I'm to blame? 
Does she really believe 
that some word of mine 
can relieve 
all her pain? 
Can't she see that she grieves 
just because she's been blindly deceived 
by her shame? 
 
Nothing's what it seems, 
maybe she'll start someday 
to realize 
If she abandons her dreams, 
then all the words she can say 
are only lies 
when will she see 
that to gain 
is only to lose? 
All that she offers me 
are her chains, 
I got to refuse 
 
Oh but it's only to herself that she's lied 
she likes to pretend 
it's something that she must defend, 
with her pride 
and I don't intend 
to stand here and be the friend 
from whom she must hide

FOUR DAYS

 All I want is something good 
It gets harder every time 
She is leaving here tonight 
Take a breath 
Take your time 
Spread your wings and rise 
Make a mark upon the wall 
Paint your face and pass the time 
Close your eyes and she ascends 
Hold your breath and ease your mind 
Forty Thousand times 
Time fades into the night 
They descend and then they climb 
Feathers falling through the night 
Have you seen Ohio rise? 
It has been four days and nights 
All I want is something fine 
It gets harder every time 
She is sleeping far away 
Take a breath 
Take your time 
Spread your wings and rise 
Rise into the black Ohio skies

FOUR WHITE STALLIONS

 (by Patrick Winningham) 
 
She had four white stallions coming around the bend 
Four strong angels at her command descend 
four more seasons for all that's broken to mend 
I got four more reasons why I 
can't go back there again 
She had skin like a statue 
milky white and pure 
carved by an artist 
who's hand is demure 
Got a mind I like a saber 
razor sharp and sure 
God how I hate myself 
for still wanting her... 
Damn these nights are dreaming.. 
Visions soft and sure 
Cause I wake to find there's 
nothing left of me in her.. 
Nothing more than a heart still at war.. 
She had four white stallions coming around the bend.. 
Four strong angels already sinned 
I got four good reasons for all that's broken to mend.. 
I got four more seasons for all that's broken to mend.. 
I got four more reasons why I cant go back there again.. 
I got four good reasons why I cant go back there again

FRIEND OF THE DEVIL

 I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds 
Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around. 
 
Set out runnin' but I take my time 
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine 
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight. 
 
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills 
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills. 
 
Set out runnin' but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine, 
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight. 
 
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there 
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air. 
 
Set out runnin' but I take my time 
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine 
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight. 
 
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night, 
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie, and she's my hearts delight. 
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail, 
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail. 
 
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee 
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me. 
 
Set out runnin' but I take my time, 
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine, 
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

GHOST TRAIN

 I took the cannonball down to the ocean 
across the desert from the sea to shining sea 
I rode a ladder that climbed across the nation 
Fifty million feet of earth between the buried and me 
 How do you do? 
She said Hey, how do you do? 
She buys a ticket cause it's cold were she comes from 
she climbs aboard because she's scared of getting older in the snow 
Love is a ghost train rumbling through the darkness 
hold on to me darling I got no where else to go 
 How do you do? 
She said Hey, how do you do? 
I took the cannonball down to the ocean 
watch the diesel disappear beneath the tumbling waves 
love is a ghost train howling on the radio 
 Remember everything She said When only memories remain 
 how do you do? 
She said Hey, how do you do?

GOIN' DOWN TO NEW YORK TOWN

 Well I feel just like a freight train baby, 
running out of steam. 
I wanna go on down to New York town, 
but I'm stuck in between. 
And I could stay on here at home alone 
and have myself to thank, 
But I just made a billion dollars 
and I wanna put it in the bank, 
So if you call... 
we could go to town. 
Well dear mom, 
if you could see me now here underneath the lights 
I gotta keep 'em on from dusk to dawn 
and everything's alright. 
I met a girl with autumn in her eyes 
and summer in the way 
She makes me feel 
like I was only born today or yesterday, 
And if she calls... 
we could go to town. 
But everybody here 
hates everything I say, 
and girl I just don't know 
if I can last another day. 
So I guess I'm going back, 
back where I belong, 
I hope you come along 
before I get back on that train that takes me... 
home from New York City 
to the things I left behind 
And 'though I ain't got no money girl 
, I'll always have the time. 
But I wish that you would hurry, 
I hope you get here soon 
'cause I just sold the sky to the sun 
so I could buy for you the moon. 
And if you call... 
we could go to town. So if you call... 
yeah, if you call... 
girl, if you call... 
we could go to town

GOOD TIME

 The gentle man caller in the blue suede shoes 
He don't know what to do 
he just wants to look good for you 
So he rushes in to tell you what he did today 
but he can't think of what to say 
I think you'll listen anyway. 
He wants to have a good time 
just like everybody else 
He doesn't want to fall apart 
You watch him as he stutters over what to say 
It's just a little game you play 
it's no easier for you some days 
You wish you could tell him it'll be ok 
but you feel a little shy these days 
cause everybody goes away 
Oh... 
You just wanna have a good time 
Just like everybody else 
You don't want to fall apart this time 
I can't look into your eyes and see the mess we're in 
darling if it's shit came out 
Then I suppose that it's shit went in 
Even though I couldn't say I've been the places that you've been 
You know you made my heart real strong 
even if you made my head real thin 
I wanna have a good time 
just like everybody 
I don't wanna fall apart 
oh.. 
I wanna have a good time 
just like everybody 
And I don't wanna fall apart this time 
so would you please invite me in

i just wanted to say 
goodnight elisabeth

and some of us are dancers on the midway 
we roam from town to town 
i hope that everybody can find a little flame

GOODNIGHT LA

 I said goodnight LA 
Cause I'm awake in my room 
I've been up for 38 hours 
And it don't look like sleep's coming soon 
Cause I could break like a bird 
Or I could swallow the sea 
It seems like the daylight is coming 
No one is watching but me 
But I don't mind the dark 
Discovering the day 
Cause the night is a beautiful bright blue and gray 
what brings me down now is love 
cause I can never get enough 
And what brings me down now is love 
cause I can never get enough of love 
And it's a dangerous time 
for a heart on a wire 
Shuttle from station to station 
noisily not knowing why 
So I put my head on the ground 
and the sky is a wheel 
Spinning these days into things that I've lost 
But you can keep all the years 
But I don't mind the days 
gone rolling away 
Cause all this sunlight feels warm on my face today 
But what brings me down now is love 
cause I can never get enough 
What brings me down now is love 
cause I can never get enough never get enough 
Never get enough no no 
Never get enough of love 
I can never get enough of love 
What brings me, brings me down now is love 
Cause I can never get enough of love 
I can never get enough of love [2X] 
I can never ever get enough 
I can never get enough of love

HARD CANDY

 On certain Sundays in November 
When the weather bothers me 
I empty drawers of other summer's 
Where my shadows used to be 
She is standing by the water 
As her smile begins to curl 
In this or any other summer 
She is something all together different 
Never just an ordinary girl 
And in the evenings on Long Island 
When the colors start to fade 
She wears a silly yellow hat 
That someone gave her when she stayed 
I didn't think that she returned it 
We left New York in a whirl 
Time expands and then contracts 
When you are spinning 
In the grips of someone 
Who is not an ordinary girl 
When you sleep 
You find your mother in the night 
But she stays just out of sight 
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming 
And when you wake the morning covers you with light 
And it makes you feel alright 
But it's just the same hard candy 
You're remembering again 
You send your lover off to China 
Then you wait for her to call 
You put your girl up on a pedestal 
Then you wait for her to fall 
I put my summer's back in a letter 
And I hide it from the world 
All the regrets you can't forget 
Are somehow pressed upon a picture 
In the face of such an ordinary girl 
When you sleep 
You find your mother in the night 
But she fades just out of sight 
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming 
And when you wake the morning showers you with light 
And it makes you feel alright 
But it's just the same hard candy 
You're remembering again 
Again [4X] 
It's just the same hard candy 
You're remembering again 
Again [4X] 
And it's just the same hard candy 
You're remembering again 
Go ask her to come around 
And see me late after dark 
Don't ask me to come around 
Then wait to if there's a spark

 All my friends got flowers in their eyes 
But I got none this season 
All of last years blooms have gone and died 
Time doesn't give a reason 
Hey baby, do you ask yourself sometimes 
What you need to be forgiven? 
Everything that you've ever done wrong 
Is the reason that I'm driven 
Straight to you 
Waiting here for you 
Wanting to tell you 
How I get my ends and my beginnings mixed up too 
Just the way you do 
Thought if I told you 
You might want to stay for just another day or two 
Waiting for the trains that just never come 
Beginning to believe in 
the disappearing nature of the people we have been 
We have begun to change into the worst kind of people 
So unkind 
Oh apologies, no apologies, this apology 
Doesn't describe the way it feels to feel for you 
Waiting here for you 
Wanting to tell you 
How I find myself slowly disappearing too 
Just the way you do 
Thought if I told you 
You might want to help me to remain with you 
I just wanna stay for a little while 
I wanna stay for a little while 
There's a night life falling down on me 
I just feel like a change 
Beneath the sun in the summer, 
a sea of flowers won't bloom without the rain 
But oh, this desert life, this high life 
Here at the dying end of the day 
I wasn't made for this scene baby 
But I was made in this scene 
And baby it's just my way 
I don't wanna go home alone, I wanna come on home to you 
Waiting here for you 
Wanting to tell you 
How I line my sky with all the silver I can use 
Just the way you do 
Thought if I told you 
You might want to stay for just another day or two

crawling round my brain 
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me 
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep 
I wish for all the world that I could say, 
 Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days. 
The devil's in the dreaming 
You see yourself descending from a building to the ground 
You watch the sky receding 
You spin to see the traffic rising up 
And it's so quiet 
You're surprised 
And then you wake 
For all the things I'm losing 
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change 
But I'm going down to Hollywood 
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find 
crawling round my brain 
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me 
And I could shake this static every time I try to sleep 
I wish for all the world that I could say, 
 Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days. 
In one of these dreams, you forgive me 
It makes me think of the bad decisions that keep you at home 
How could anyone else have changed? 
All these wrong conclusions that leave you alone 
How could everyone rearrange? 
How could everyone else have changed? 
What I see I believe 
For all the things I'm losing 
I might as well resign myself to try and make a change 
Well, I'm going down to Hollywood 
They're gonna make a movie from the things that they find 
crawling around my brain 
I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me 
And I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep 
I wish for all the world that I could say, 
 Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing alright these days. 
But I can't sleep at night

I'M NOT SLEEPING

 Waiting for the moon to come and light me up inside 
And I am waiting for the telephone to tell me I'm alive 
Well I heard you let somebody get their fingers into you 
It's getting cold in California 
I guess I'll be leaving soon 
Daylight fading 
Come and waste another year 
All the the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear 
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn 
When we see the early signs that daylight's fading 
We leave just before it's gone 
She said everybody loves you, 
she says, everybody cares 
But all the things I keep inside myself 
they vanish in the air 
If you tell me that you'll wait for me 
I'll say I won't be here 
I want to say goodbye to you 
Goodbye to all my friends 
Goodbye to everyone I know 
Daylight fading 
Come and waste another year 
All the the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear 
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn 
When we see the early signs that daylight's fading

 Happy birthday baby 
What's it gonna be 
Monday morning' with a hurricane warning' 
Oh well, I guess you've got yourself to please 
Jaded. Faded. 
I don't wanna be afraid. 
Jaded. I hate it. 
I don't wanna be your slave. 
Saw you peeking' round my garden gate 
I thought you'd liked what you'd seen 
So I said, Darlin' if you want a little of these peaches, 
just come on and shake my tree. 
Jaded. Faded. 
I don't wanna be your slave. 
Jaded. I hate it. 
I don't wanna be afraid. 
Every waking' hour 
We break down in different combinations. 
We spin around in smaller constellations. 
Took a ride on the love wheel 
Scary, scary go round and around. 
Honey, Honey I don't want none of your money. 
I just want off before we hit the ground. 
Jaded. Faded. 
I don't wanna be your friend. 
Jaded. I hate it. 
I don't wanna be your slave. 
Saw you hangin' around the avenue baby 
So I got down outta my tree. 
I think I need a little animal honey. 
Come on and shake a little monkey with me. 
Jaded. Faded. 
Oh. I don't wanna be afraid. 
Jaded. I hate it. 
I don't wanna be your slave 
Every waking' hour 
We break down in smaller combinations. 
We spin around in different constellations. 
Wanna be right there to carry you away 
Knowing that our love will last through the day. 
It's the same thing. 
Gonna be here on the light, on the light 
I wanna see me, see me going away 
I've been gone such a long time. 
Leaving' again today. 
Leaving' someday

 Its crazy but often clear often clear.. 
We shimmer and disappear 
In color in black and white black and white.. 
We slowly fade out of site 
but these days were lit by lightning thin lines of light 
Its crazy but somehow clear somehow clear 
we ride in silence out of fear 
We've spoken seem come alive come alive 
we prefer the silence of the blind 
But these days were lit by lightning 
thin lines of light 
these days 
were lit by lines 
of sharp

we rage in violence blind 
Together and then alone then alone 
we race in small circles home

LIVE FOREVER

 (by Oasis) 
(Sung as an intro to A Long December) 
 
Maybe I don't really want to know 
how your garden grows 
'cause I just want to fly 
Lately did you ever feel the pain 
in the morning rain 
as it soaks you to the bone 
Maybe I just want to fly 
I want to live I don't want to die 
Maybe I just want to breathe 
Maybe I just don't believe 
Maybe you're the same as me 
We see things they'll never see 
You and I are gonna live forever 
I said 
maybe I don't really want to know 
how your garden grows 
'cause I just want to fly 
Lately did you ever feel the pain 
in the morning rain 
as it soaks you to the bone 
Maybe I will never be 
all the things that I want to be 
Now is not the time to cry 
Now's the time to find out why 
I think you're the same as me 
We see things they'll never see 
You and I are gonna live forever 
Maybe I don't really want to know 
how your garden grows 
'cause I just want to fly 
Lately did you ever feel the pain

Maybe I just want to fly 
I want to live I don't want to die 
Maybe I just want to breathe 
Maybe I just don't believe 
Maybe you're the same as me 
We see things they'll never see

Gonna live forever

 Put on your bad self 
get out your party dress and fix up your makeup try 
to make a good impression this is a new world 
were all the same here, well maybe not the same you know what I mean. 
I've got everything that you want I've got everything and someday Ill be president. 
I've for everything that you want.. 
I've got everything except the single thing you really need. 
Separate, love from addiction its not the same I know 
I see desperation pulling my strings. Hey eliza now what do you want? 
I play piano and I sing like a humming bird and oh I forgot 
that humming birds don't sing, it doesn't matter really you know what I mean. 
I've got everything that you want I've got everything 
and its a brand new world eliza. I've got everything that you want.. 
I've got everything except the single thing you really need. 
Sail away blood and rejection ..they isolate. 
I know I see, a generation staring back at me.. 
Wasted away.... 
wasted my time this picture you see is nothing like the one 
I wanted painted of me. 
 Eliza says it's all right with me, if your sure ... 
it wouldn't be the first time, you know it's happened a couple of times before 
and.. I don't even expect much anymore and anyway... 
it's not as if I was waiting for you to come and make it all okay . 
Shut away to to wing blood and rejection they isolate 
I know I see visions of people grabbing hold of me. 
Wasted away... wasted my time... 
this picture you see is nothing like the one I wanted painted of me. 
Put on your bad self, get out your party dress and fix up your makeup try

LOW

 (by Cracker) 
 
Sometimes I wanna take you down. 
Sometimes I wanna get you low. 
Brush your hair back from your eyes. 
Take you down let the river flow. 
Sometimes I go and walk the street 
Behind the green sheet of glass. 
A million miles below their feet 
A million miles, a million miles 
CHORUS: 
I'll be with you girl 
Like being low 
hey hey hey like being stoned. 
I'll be with you girl 
Like being low 
hey hey hey like being stoned. 
A million poppies gonna make me sleep. 
Just one rose and knows your name 
The fruit is rusting on the vine 
The fruit is calling from the trees 
Hey don't you wanna go down 
Like some junkie cosmonaut 
A million miles below their feet 
A million miles a million miles 
CHORUS 
Blue blue is the sun. 
Brown brown is the sky. 
Green green of her eyes. 
A million miles a million miles 
Hey hey don't you wanna go down 
Like some disgraced cosmonaut 
A million miles below their feet 
A million miles a million miles

MAGGIE MAY

 (by Rod Stewart) 
 
Wake up Maggie, I think I've got something to say to you 
It's late September and I really should be back at school 
I know I keep you amused 
But I feel I'm being used 
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more 
You led me away from home 
Just to save you from being alone 
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts 
The morning sun when it's in your eyes really shows your age 
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything 
I laughed at all of your jokes 
My love you didn't need to coax 
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more 
You led me away from home 
Just to save you from being alone 
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without 
All I needed was a friend to lend a helping hand 
But you turned into a lover and mother, what a lover, you wore me out 
All you did was wreck my bed 
and in the morning kick me in the head 
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more 
You led me away from home 
'Cause you didn't want to be alone 
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried 
I suppose I could collect my books and go on back to school 
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living at playing pool 
Or find myself a rock and roll band 
That needs a helping hand 
Oh Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face 
You made a first class fool out of me 
But I'm as blind as a fool can be 
You stole my heart but I love you anyway 
I'd never seen your face 
I'll get on back home, one of these days

MARGERY DREAMS OF HORSES

 In the still water she lies down 
Shaking through the press of sunlight 
We rolled into Lexington 
She shakes off the drop of daylight 
Water beading up her chest 
Bleeding down between her knees 
Rivers in Kentucky flow 
Between the bluegrass wavy seas 
But oh, Margery 
Twists the knife once more inside of me 
Breathless with anticipation 
Baited reelers set their hooks 
Tuck their heads beneath the high grass 
And lie and wait beside the brooks 
Were infants pushing slowly through 
Frustration leading back along 
The alleys of a childhood 
That will not release us willingly 
But oh, Margery ..sticks the knife in while I couldn't see (strait into me baby) 
Dust me off and shut me down 
And dream of where I haven't been 
Close the door inside my heart 
Stuck in the south Atlantic wind 
I have hollow eyes 
Haunting only to myself 
Even so, I can't stop calling 
These great big hollows in my self 
I took the train form California 
To the far side of the continent 
Woke up in Kentucky 
Where a wedding was about to end 
I looked up at Anna 
She turned back to look at me 
It's best to kill the ones that matter 
Render blind the ones who see 
But oh, Margery 
Takes the blade and walks away from me 
Oh, Margery 
Love like blood is pouring out of me 
Oh, Margery 
My heart won't stop bleeding over me baby 
Oh, I can't shut it in 
It's got far too many doors to block the wind 
Oh, I can't shut it in 
It's got far too many doors to block the wind

MERCURY

 She is trapped inside a month of grey 
And they take a little every day 
She is a victim of her own responses 
Shackled to a heart that wants to settle 
And then runs away 
It's a sin to be fading endlessly 
Yeah, but she's alright with me 
She is leaving on a walkaway 
She is leaving me in disarray 
In the absence of a place to be 
She stands there looking back at me 
Hesitates, and then turns away 
She'll change so suddenly 
She's just like mercury 
Yeah, but she's alright with me 
Keep some sorrow in your hearts and minds 
For the things that die before their time 
For the restlessly abandoned homes 
The tired and weary rambler's bones 
And stay beside me where I lie 
She's entwined in me 
Crazy as can be 
Yeah, but she's alright with me

MRS' PORTER'S LULLABY

 Well I woke up in mid afternoon cause that's when it all hurts the most 
I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host 
If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts 
You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast 
Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame 
I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame 
If you've never stared off in the distance, then your life is a shame 
And though I'll never forget your face, 
sometimes I can't remember my name 
Hey Mrs. Potter don't cry 
Hey Mrs. Potter I know why but 
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me 
Well, there's a piece of Maria in every song that I sing 
And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings 
And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring 
And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything 
Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said 
And the ghosts of the tilt a whirl will linger inside of your head 
And the ferris wheel junkies will spin them forever instead 
When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in bed 
Hey Mrs. Potter don't go 
Hey Mrs. Potter I don't know but 
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me 
All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep 
And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep 
All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep 
Hey I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep 
So I throw my hand into the air and it swims in the beams 
It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream 
Well, I know I don't know you and you're probably not what you seem 
But I'd sure like to find out 
So why don't you climb down off that movie screen 
Hey Mrs. Potter don't turn 
Hey Mrs. Potter I burn for you 
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me 
When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor 
and orders another 
Well, I wonder what he did that for 
That's when I know that I have to get out cause I have been there before 
So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door 
We drove out to the desert just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars 
We stand up at the Palace like it's the last of the great Pioneertown bars 
We shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars 
You can see a million miles tonight 
But you can't get very far 
Hey Mrs. Potter I won't touch and 
Hey Mrs. Potter it's not much but 
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me

MRS. POTTER'S LULLABY

 Well I woke up in mid afternoon cause that's when it all hurts the most 
I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host 
If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts 
You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast 
Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame 
I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame 
If you've never stared off in the distance, then your life is a shame 
And though I'll never forget your face, 
sometimes I can't remember my name 
Hey Mrs. Potter don't cry 
Hey Mrs. Potter I know why but 
Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me 
Well, there's a piece of Maria in every song that I sing 
And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings 
And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring 
And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything

Goes down for water

Well night time let her through 
Yeah I am talking to you 
I wanna see her 
Precious little thing 
with eyes that dance around without their clothes 
So buy a pretty dress 
Wear it out tonight 
For anyone you think could out do me 
Or better still, be my winding wheel 
Cause I feel just like a map 
Without a single place to go of interest 
And I am further north than south 
If I could shut my mouth she'd probably like this 
So buy a pretty dress 
And wear it out tonight 
For all the boys you think could out do me 
Or better still, be my winding wheel 
Be my winding wheel 
Well the children laugh and sing a song that ushers in her driving rain 
And I am standing in the station like some old record waiting on a train 
So buy a pretty dress 
Wear it out tonight 
For anyone you think could out do me 
Or better still be my winding wheel

American people with marvelous hair 
And a knack to do anything better than anyone 
I got a home with electrical air 
And I live in a world 
Smaller than anyone 
I got a line on a new frontier 
I got a line on a new America 
All of the people are vanishing here 
I could be huge, If I could just get home 
From the outside of everything 
To the inside of you 
From the outside of everything 
To the inside of you 
Purest Aluminum people 
are walking the streets of London 
So hysterical 
Nobody here gets a word that I say 
and the problems I'm told, are more than medical 
I got a friend from the new frontier 
And Galen, she says, this is not america You need a girl with electrical hair 
And the words that you wanted was al u mi num 
From the outside of everything 
To the inside of you 
From the outside of everything 
To the inside

The girl at the end of the world 
She says I'm goin home 
And you should come home too 
I'm at the end of a new frontier 
here at the edge of the flat earth ending 
I'm getting off to get lost in the air 
At the end of the world where the light is bending 
From the outside of everything

 Nothing but a Child Glass upon me walking on the ocean 
Sun upon me walking on a wave 
You can slide like the lord above.. You're a beam of teaming motion 
But for everyone you do, 
There's always one or two like me you can't save 
Sail on Maria, burn her to the ground 
Slide your hand between her tears until she comes 
Wake up her mother, tell her You're sorry now 
All gods children walk before they run 
Everything is beautiful in dreamland 
Everything is much, much better when we're gone 
Think I'm going to write myself a letter 
Something you can keep with you forever 
Because everybody gets to be perfect when they're gone

Did you ever hover in the distance? 
Did you ever swoop down from the sky 
to the bright green rocks all draped with seaweed 
and the deep blue ocean rolling by? 
Maybe I will find today 
Maybe I will lose tomorrow 
Gonna rock on to the oceanside 
Did you ever see into the future? 
See the big red sun that won't go down? 
And the giant moths upon the cliffside 
In the deep red scar that was our town? 
Maybe I will find today 
Maybe I will lose tomorrow 
Gonna rock on to the oceanside 
Baby, we're the king and queen of nothing 
Everybody glows and then they're numb 
We can make a moment last forever 
Gaze across the ocean to the sun 
Maybe I will find today 
Maybe I will lose tomorrow 
Gonna rock on to the oceanside 
Gonna rock on to the oceanside 
Gonna rock on to the oceanside 
Baby, we're the king and queen of something 
Everybody goes and then they come

OH MY SWEET CAROLINA

 (by Ryan Adams) 
 
I went down to Houston 
and I stopped in San Antone 
I passed up the station for the bus 
I was trying to find me something 
but I wasn t sure just what 
Man I ended up with pockets full of dust 
So I went on to Cleveland and I ended up insane 
I bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance 
I was spending money like the way it likes to rain 
Man I ended up with pockets full of cane 
Oh my sweet Carolina 
What compels me to go? 
Oh my sweet disposition 
May you one day carry me home 
I ain t never been to Vegas, but I gambled up my life 
Building newsprint boats I race to sewer mains 
Was trying to find me something but I wasn t sure just what 
Funny how they say that some things never change 
Oh my sweet Carolina 
What compels me to go? 
Oh my sweet disposition 
May you one day carry me home 
Up here in the city feels like things are closing in 
The sunset s just my light bulb burning out 
I miss KENTUCKY and I miss my family 
All the sweetest winds they blow across the south 
Oh my sweet Carolina 
What compels me to go? 
Oh my sweet disposition 
May you one day carry me home 
May you one day carry me home

Poor old granddad I laughed at all his words 
I thought he was a bitter man 
He spoke of women's ways 
They'll trap you then they use you & before you even know 
For love is blind and you're far too kind 
Don't ever let it show 
I wish that I knew what I know now 
when I was younger 
I wish that I knew what I know now 
when I was stronger 
The can can such a pretty show 
will steal your heart away 
But backstage back on earth again 
The dressing rooms are grey 
They come on strong and it ain't too long 
For they make you feel a man 
But love is blind and you soon will find 
you're just a boy again 
When you want her lips, you get her cheek 
Makes you wonder where you are 
if you want some more then she's fast asleep 
Leaves you twinkling with the stars 
Poor young grandson there's nothing I can say 
You'll have to learn, just like me 
And that's the hardest way, ooh la la 
I wish that I knew what I know now 
when I was younger 
I wish that I knew what I know now 
when I was stronger

PANCHO & LEFTY

 (by Townes Van Zandt) 
 
Livin' on the road, my friend 
Was gonna keep you free and clean 
But now you wear your skin like iron 
And your breath as hard as kerosene 
You weren't your mama's only boy 
But her favorite one, it seems 
She began to cry when you said goodbye 
And sank into your dreams 
Pancho was a bandit, boys 
His horse as fast as polished steel 
He wore his gun outside his pants 
For all the honest world to feel 
Pancho met his match, you know 
On the deserts down in Mexico 
No one heard his dyin' words 
Ah, but that's the way it goes 
All the federales say 
They could have had him any day 
They only let him slip away 
Out of kindness, I suppose 
Lefty he can't sing the blues 
All night long like he used to 
The dust that Pancho bit down south 
Ended up in Lefty's mouth 
The day they laid poor Pancho low 
Lefty split for Ohio 
Where he got the bread to go 
There ain't nobody 'knows 
All the federales say 
They could have had him any day 
We only let him slip away 
Out of kindness, I suppose 
The poets tell how Pancho fell 
And Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel 
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold 
And so the story ends, we're told 
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true 
But save a few for Lefty, too 
He only did what he had to do 
And now he's growin' old 
All the federales say 
We could have had him any day 
They only let him go so long 
Out of kindness, I suppose 
A few old gray federales still say 
We could have had him any day 
We only let him go so long 
Out of kindness, I suppose

It's raining in Baltimore, baby 
But everything else is the same 
There's things I remember and things I forget 
I miss you I guess that I should 
Three thousand five hundred miles away 
But what would you change if you could? 
I need a phone call Maybe I should buy a new car 
I can always hear a freight train baby if I listen real hard 
And I wish it was a small world 
Because I'm lonely for the big towns 
I'd like to hear a little guitar 
I guess it's time to put the top down 
I need a phone call 
I need a raincoat

RETURN OF THE GREVIOUS ANGEL

 (by Gram Parsons) 
 
Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich 
and welcome me back to town 
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor 
and I'll show you how it all went down 
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels 
and a good saloon in every single town 
Oh, and I remember something you once told me 
and I'll be damned if it did not come true 
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down 
and they all lead me straight back home to you 
 Cause I headed west to grow up with the country 
Across those prairies with the waves of grain 
And I saw my devil, 
and I saw my deep blue sea 
And I thought about a calico bonnet from 
Cheyenne to Tennessee 
We flew straight across that river bridge, 
last night at half past two 
The switchman wave his lantern goodbye 
and so long as we went rolling through 
Billboards and truckstops pass by the grievous angel 
And now I know just what I have to do 
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone 
He wants to take my money for something 
that I've never been shown 
And I saw my devil, 
and I saw my deep blue sea 
And I thought about a calico bonnet from 
Cheyenne to Tennessee 
The news I could bring I met up with the king 
On his head an amphetamine crown 
He talked about unbuckling that old Bible belt 
And lighted out for some desert town 
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels 
And a good saloon in every single town 
Oh, but I remembered something you once told me 
and I'll be damned if it did not come true 
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down 
and they all lead me straight back home to you 
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down 
And they all lead me straight back home to you

 Oh Shannon 
I might be dreaming' 
The stars fell down on the factory 
The cathedrals repeating, the light receding 
Bells on another day 
Have you ever seen my face 
Fast asleep and dreaming'? 
Oh Shannon 
The lightning' fell 
There's an army down by the riverside 
But I might be dreaming' 
I can see that you don't believe me 
And I might be dreaming' 
If I dip into your water 
Fall through my reflection 
I will shadow myself anyway 
Have you ever seen my face 
Fast asleep and dreaming'? 
And it don't seem right 
That I don't get no sleep at night 
What's the river gonna know about leaving'? 
Oh Shannon 
The soldiers are coming' 
The guns are drumming' the night away 
Rain, rain go away 
Come again some other day 
When I got time for believing' 
Have you ever seen my face 
Fast asleep and dreaming'? 
Yeah! What is there left to believe in?! 
Oh Shannon 
I might be dreaming' 
I might be wasting' my life away 
listening' to you 
Down on under the streetlight 
You shudder and beat 
The edge of the waterway 
And I know if I had time 
I might dive in your water 
Lie right down in the evening rain 
I just want this pain, pain to go away 
Come again some other day 
When I got time for bleeding' 
Have you ever seen my face 
Fast asleep and dreaming'? 
And it don't seem right that I don't get no sleep at night 
What's the river gonna know about leaving'?

ROUND HERE

 Step out the front door like a ghost 
into the fog where no one notices 
the contrast of white on white. 
And in between the moon and you 
the angels get a better view 
of the crumbling difference between wrong and right. 
I walk in the air between the rain, 
through myself and back again. 
Where? I don't know 
Maria says she's dying. 
Through the door, I hear her crying 
Why? I don't know 
Round here we always stand up straight 
Round here something radiates 
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand 
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis 
She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land 
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus 
She parks her car outside of my house, 
takes her clothes off, 
Says she's close to understanding Jesus 
She knows she's more that just a little misunderstood 
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous 
Round here we're carving out our names 
Round here we all look the same 
Round here we talk just like lions 
But we sacrifice like lambs 
Round here she's slipping through my hands 
Sleeping children got to run like the wind 
Out of the lightning dream 
Mama's little baby better get herself in 
Out of the lightning 
She says, It's only in my head. 
She says, Shhh....I know it's only in my head. 
But the girl on the car in the parking lot 
says: Man, you should try to take a shot 
Can't you see my walls are crumbling. 
Then she looks up at the building 
and says she's thinking of jumping. 
She says she's tired of life; 
she must be tired of something. 
Round here she's always on my mind 
Round here I got lots of time 
Round here we're never sent to bed early 
Nobody makes us wait 
Round here we stay up very very late

SAILOR SONG

 Walk out Amanda, our fortunes are clear 
These are the last of our days 
Left San Francisco with time on my hands 
And I got back with you on my brain 
So bring me a second or bring me an hour 
Bring me the world in a tear 
Bring me a little of anything Amanda 
And I'll keep it close to me here 
Press it among the best years of my heart and my tears 
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want 
Throw me up on the shore tonight and I'll count the last light 
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want... 
Come on Amanda, you know what I mean 
You won't be happy 'round here 
Got on the wagon the tenth of December 
I fell off the first of the year 
And I know you wish I was better then that 
I know you wish I was dry 
God knows I wish I was somebody else 
Right now I wish I could die 
Press it among the best years of my heart and my tears 
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want 
Maybe among the earphones of my heart and my soul 
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want everything 
And I want to be a raider, I want anything 
And I want to be a man 
What's the matter? 
Didn't you think we were trying? 
Hey, what's the matter? 
Didn't you think I was somebody else who 
could lie in the wake of you smile? 
Spent twenty six stiffening years down the drain 
Women who will spit in your eye 
And a drunkard like me gets the worst of your love 
Good riddance, good luck and good bye 
Press it among the best years of my heart and my tears 
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want 
Maybe among the hill folds of my heart and my soul 
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want 
Singing 'till the sky turns and lungs burst and throat burns 
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want 
Screaming 'till the sun houses my here and my now 
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want everything 
And I want to be a sailor, I want anything 
And I wanna be a man 
I want everything 
And I wanna be a sailor, I want anything 
And I wanna be a man 
And I wanna be a man 
And I wanna be a man

SHALLOW DAYS

 Mary Jane says it's all right 
She's just around the corner from the main light. 
Any day now, it's all right 
She's standing on the precipice of big time. 
And I know I'm a little uptight, 
I've got to go before the sun shines. 
We're just a couple small people squeezing out a life, 
We need a little good time. 
It's not far from the edge, 
Mary comes and goes. 
Drifting through the scenery of the shallow days below, 
That is anybody knows. 
You follow trains out of town and they vanish somewhere under the horizon. 
Yeah well I saw Mary Jane dragged her shadow down the tracks, Stare off in the distance. 
It's not far from here, 
Mary waves hello. 
Smiling though she's sinking in the shallow days below, 
I can't find a way out of here. 
Out on the road again, 
I'm much, much too concerned about Mary Jane. 
I'm all alone again, 
I like what she said, not what it means. 
She leaves me drowning through the shallow days, down below. 
You know I heard a band playing waltzes in a grange hall 
The sun is sinking lower. 
People staring, Mary Jane humming softly to herself, 
Nobody really knows her. 
Any day now it's all right, 
She tells herself that this will be the last time. 
Mary Jane pulls her hair back and wonders what she'll do with all her free time. 
Not too far from here, 
Mary turns to go. 
Smiling while the waltz begins, dancing down the road 
Hey hey Mr. Freedom, 
What are we supposed to think? 
'Cause I'm a very tiny person and it worries me. 
I'm all alone again, 
I like what she says, not what it means. 
She leaves me drowning in the shallow days way down below. 
 I'm sorry , she said, 
 I know it's not the kind of thing you want. 
I'm falling, falling down. 
 I'm sorry , she said. 
 I know I'm not the kind of girl you want. 
We're falling, falling, falling, falling down

SHE DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE

 (by Robyn Hitchcock) 
 
I used to ring you and put down the phone, 
once wore a hole in your dress. 
Even tried Voodoo outside your home, 
but these days I couldn't care less. 
 
She doesn't exist any more, 
She doesn't exist any more. 
I let her go like the fool that I was, 
thought I'd get over her soon. 
I smell her perfume when my eyes are closed, 
and I see her face in the moon. 
She doesn't exist any more, 
She doesn't exist any more. 
I tell myself it would be different now, 
I wouldn't treat her that way. 
I wouldn't be me if she wasn't her, 
and it's far too late, anyway. 
'Cause she doesn't exist any more, 
She doesn't exist any more. 
Only inside you the ghost of the love, 
that is wordless and painful and old. 
There's no one else in the whole outside world, 
that matches to her in your soul. 
But she doesn't exist any more, 
She doesn't exist any more

This is stranger than I thought 
Six different ways inside my heart 
And every one I'll keep tonight 
Six different ways go deep inside 
 
I'll tell them anything at all 
I know I'll give them more and more 
 
I'll tell them anything at all 
I know I'll give the world and more 
They think I'm on my hands and head 
This time they're much too slow 
 
Six sides to every lie I say 
It's that American voice again 
 It was never quite like this before 
Not one of you is the same... 
This is stranger than I thought 
Six different ways inside my heart 
And everyone I'll keep tonight 
Six different ways go deep inside

bind up your legs 
Bind up your heart and hold you down till 
you say your sorry she's been waiting for you forever now and now

To hide your cheery lies you make excuses 
in between each lemon breath she smiles and swallows your abuses 
Shake the chains that tie you to the ground

Bind up your heart and hold you down till

Say your sorry she's been waiting waiting.. 
Inside your plastic head

 I dream of Ballerinas and I don't know why 
but I see Cadillac's sailing 
I was born on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay 
But Maryland and Virginia have faded away 
And I keep thinking tomorrow is coming today 
So I am endlessly waiting 
And the comet is coming between 
Me and the girl who could make it all clean 
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine 
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream. 
Carrie's down in her basement all toe shoes and twinned 
With the girl in the mirror who spins when she spins 
From where you think you'll end up to the state that you're in 
Your reflection approaches and then recedes again 
And the comet is coming between 
Me and the girl who could make it all clean 
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine 
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream. 
I have dreamed of a black car that shimmers and drives 
Down the length of the evening to the carnival side 
In a house where regret is a carousel ride 
We are spinning and spinning and spinning and now... 
There's a hole in the ceiling down through which I fell 
There's a girl in a basement coming out of her shell 
And there are people who will say that they knew me so well' 
I may not go to heaven 
I hope you go to hell 
And the comet is coming between 
Me and the girl who could make it all clean 
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine 
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream

SUFFOCATE

 Good morning baby, guess you wanna touch me now 
You wanna put your hands on my face 
Tell me you love me, 
Tell me you need me 
Don't say you love me 
Don't say anything... 
'Cause I am not that kind of man, I'm much less than you think I am... 
So many people are just like Jesus, 
They drag all this weight, to get to anything better than... 
Where they've been 
Or where they are 
Well tell me what the hell's the reason when we never get 
anywhere... 
But you want me to say Hey, it's okay... 
But I'm so dizzy baby, just get the hell away from me... 
How can you breathe? 
How can you see? 
I can't even sleep when you're with me... 
I'm sick of summertime 
I know, all of the best things in life are unkind 
To be everything I could be, anything 
But all the time I'm thinking, If I only had a pair of wings... 
But you want touch me 
Just get your hands off me 
Don't touch me 
And baby, I can't see that you see 
How can you see? 
How can you breathe? 
I can't feel a thing when you're with me... 
I can't take it this way, I hope you understand, 
Don't you fucking touch me 
I can hardly stand to look at you 
How can you breathe? 
How can you see? 
How can you breathe? 
How can you see? 
I can't even sleep when you're with me 
How can you breathe? 
How can you see? 
I can't feel... 
I can't feel a thing... 
Can't feel a thing... 
Can't feel a thing... 
Can't feel a thing...

SUPERSONIC

 (by Oasis) 
 
I need to be myself 
I can't be no one else 
I'm feeling supersonic 
Give me gin and tonic 
You can have it all but how much do you want it? 
You make me laugh 
Give me your autograph 
Can I ride with you in your BMW ? 
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine 
You need to find out 
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about 
You need to find a way for what you want to say 
But before tomorrow 
'Cos my friend said he'd take you home 
He sits in a corner all alone 
He lives under a waterfall 
Nobody can see him 
Nobody can ever hear him call 
You need to be yourself 
You can't be no one else 
I know a girl called Elsa 
She's into Alka Seltzer 
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train 
She made me laugh 
I got her autograph 
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter 
She's sniffin in her tissue 
Sellin' the Big Issue 
She needs to find out 
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about 
She needs to find a way for what she wants to say 
But before tomorrow 
'Cos my friend said he'd take you home 
He sits in a corner all alone

Well I hope Neil Young will remember 
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue

Does your conscience bother you tell me true

Now Muscle Shoals has got the swampers, they've been known to pick a song or two

THE BALLAD OF EL GOODO

 (by Big Star) 
 
Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh 
and I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds 
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on 
But guns they wait to be stuck by, at my side is God 
And there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round 
Ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round 
There's people around who tell you that they know 
And places where they send you, and it's easy to go 
They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row 
But you know you don't have to, you can just say no 
I've been built up and trusted, broke down and busted 
But they'll get theirs and we will get ours if you can 
just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
Years ago my heart was set to live, oh 
but I've been trying hard against strong odds 
It gets so hard at times like now to hold on 
Well, I'll fall if I don't fight, and at my side is God

A man in my shoes runs a light 
All the papers lie tonight 
But falling over you 
is the news of the day 
Angels fall like rain 
and love , is all of heaven way 
inside you the time moves and she don't fade 
the ghost in you she don't fade away 
The race is on, I'm on your side 
but hearing you my engines died 
I'm in the mood for you 
or for running away 
All the stars come down in you 
but love, love, love you cant give it away 
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade 
the ghost in you she don't fade 
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade away 
don't you know she don't fade 
don't you go it makes no sense 
And all these talking superman 
just take away the time just to get it away 
aint it just like the rain 
cause love,love,love,love is only heaven away 
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade 
the ghost in you she don't fade away 
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade away 
the ghost in you she don't fade 
A man in my shoes runs a light 
but all the papers lie tonight 
falling over you is the news of the day 
and love will not fade away

I'll stay up waiting for my dusky wife

If I had a dollar 
For every time 
you broke my heart 
messed up my mind 
I'd be the richest man 
I'd be the richest man

If bad times paid interest 
I'd have you to thank 
I'd be driving a new car 
Have money in the bank 
I'd be the richest man 
I'd be the richest man 
in the world 
baby baby 
Money cant buy love 
the kind I dream of 
that's so hard to find 
A good woman's touch 
in the morning when I rise 
baby I'd give up every single dime 
Money cant buy love the kind I dream of 
that's so hard to find 
For a good woman's touch in the morning when I rise 
baby I'd give up every single dime 
If teardrops were diamonds 
from the African mines 
if heartaches were silver 
my whole life would shine 
I'd be the richest man 
I'd be the richest man 
in the world

Come inside where it's okay 
And I'll shake you. 
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of

THIS MUST BE THE PLACE

Home is where I want to be 
Pick me up and turn me around 
I feel numb burn with a weak heart 
(So I) guess I must be having fun 
The less we say about it the better 
Make it up as we go along 
Feet on the ground 
Head in the sky 
It's okay I know nothing's wrong . . nothing 
 
Hi yo I got plenty of time 
Hi yo you got light in your eyes 
And you're standing here beside me 
I love the passing of time 
Never for money 
Always for love 
Cover up and say goodnight . . . say goodnight 
Home is where I want to be 
But I guess I'm already there 
I come home she lifted up her wings 
Guess that this must be the place 
I can't tell one from another 
Did I find you, or you find me? 
There was a time before we were born 
If someone asks, this is where I'll be . . . where I'll be 
Hi yo We drift in and out 
Hi yo sing into my mouth 
Out of all those kinds of people 
You got a face with a view 
I'm just an animal looking for a home 
Share the same space for a minute or two 
And you love me till my heart stops 
Love me till I'm dead 
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you 
Cover up the blank spots 
Hit me on the head Ah ooh

Don't run back inside

So you're scared and you're thinking 
That maybe we ain't that young anymore 
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night 
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright 
Oh and that's alright with me 
Oh oh come take my hand 
Driving out tonight to case the promised land

When the roads are clear, 
We'll head on out of here, 
If you're coming back, 
I'll see you in the morning

Just waiting for the daylight to come crawling in on me...

Put your jeans on tight, 
Wear a dress, so I can get it off real easy. 
'Cause I've been thinking I'd 
like to see your eyes 
open up real wide the minute that you see me. 
If you don't come through, 
I wouldn't wait for you. 
I understand that everyone goes disappearing, 
into the greatest grey 
that covers over everyday, 
and hovers in the distance and the distance and the distance...

gets me high

could believe what you believe

Drown myself on sky

I think I realize, yeah 
Didn't you wonder where your bright eyed babyboy has gone 
He's sleeping in the bottom of a wishing well 
Whispering' the ripples through the fates and changes 
Did you think you were young and beautiful

One or two people sliding gracefully together and apart 
This sort of thing never lasts

I guess I'll realize when I'm twisting in the wind 
After I say good bye, I guess I'll understand why 
I guess I realize 
I guess I realize 
Didn't you wonder where your bright eyed babyboy has gone 
He's a victim in the bottom of a wishing well 
Wishing he was anywhere but there and gone 
And, didn't anyone wonder where their bright eyed babyboy has gone 
He's sleeping in the bottom of a wishing well 
Wishing he wasn't suffering the same dreams all day long 
I think I realize 
I think I realize 
Ahh baby, I think that I realize 
I think I realize
