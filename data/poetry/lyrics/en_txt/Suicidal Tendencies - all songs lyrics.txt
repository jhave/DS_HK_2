A LITTLE EACH DAY

 Took a walk down under the street 
Never thought that I'd see the day I would meet 
Came and whispered in my ear 
But I treid to pretend that I didn't hear 
Turned my head and I walked away 
I treid to forget what they had to say 
Put on a smile and I tried to hide 
But I couldn't keep myself from crying inside 
 
[CHORUS] 
Oh I...So I turned my head and I walked away 
Oh I...And I tried to forget what he had to say 
Oh I...And I chalked it up as another day 
Oh I say...I died a little today 
 
Took a journey through my brain 
And they saw the scars and they felt my pain 
Saw the things I din't want to find 
Knew the dreams I had over a bottle of wine 
Thought if I lied I was oigng to win 
But they said the battle wouldn't even begin 
Thought about the lies that I said to myself 
But I knew it's too late to find the help 
 
[CHORUS]

Took a walk down under the street 
Never thought that I'd see the day I would meet 
Came and whispered in my ear

Turned my head and walked away 
And I tried to forget what they had to say 
Put on a smile and I tried to hide 
But I couldn't keep myself from crying inside

Oh, I...So I turned my head and I walked away 
Oh, I...And I tried to forget what he had to say 
Oh, I...And I chalked it up as another day 
Oh, I say...I died a little today 
 
Took a journey through my brain

I die a little each day 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
ACCEPT MY SACRIFICE

 No destination set 
I daze along till something finds me 
Where I've been I'm not sure 
I cannot see the tears, they blind me 
 
You know that something ain't right 
It's a sacrifice 
Why must I pay this price 
Accept my sacrifice 
 
An emptiness so full 
I cap it off with expectations 
A sight not to behold 
I cover all in explanations 
 
It's a sacrifice 
No no no no no 
It's a sacrifice a sacrifice 
 
Sailing off of course, directions lost 
There is no exit 
The captain's abandoned ship, now mutiny 
How could I suspect this 
 
It's a sacrifice, it's a sacrifice, accept my sacrifice 
It's a sacrifice, it's a sacrifice, it's a sacrifice 
Accept my sacrifice 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
AIN'T GONNA TAKE IT

 [Muir, Paul, Pleasants] 
 
Ain't gonna take it Amymore [3x's] 
 
Don't mess with my head don't mess with my head 
Don't mess with my head don't mess with my mind 
Now you messed with me the very last time 
Well I'm mad as hell hell that's the truth 
For someone like you I got no use 
 
[Chorus:] Ain't gonna take it Anymore [3X's] 
 
It's a quarter to pain half past hate 
I got to get moving cause I'm running late 
It was all thought out, but now I'm breaking the pain 
In a moment we'll find out who's the man 
Well you should have stopped and seen that I'm not the one 
Now there's no stopping what's got to get done 
You shouldn't have messed with my head 
You shouldn't have messed with my mind 
And now you'll find out about cyco time 
 
[Chorus:] Ain't gonna take it Anymore 
 
You picked at my soul you picked at my brain 
You pushed my button like I'm a video game 
You picked at my head you picked at my mind 
But now you've picked on me the very last time 
Cause I'm heavy on my mind and I'm light on my feet 
That's just the sad facts thats not conceit 
You picked at my head you picked at my mind 
But now you've picked on me the very last time 
Ain't gonna take it Ain't gonna take it Ain't gonna take it 
 
[Chorus:] Ain't gonna take it Anymore [3X's] 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
ALONE

 I scream at the sky, it's easier than crying 
I'm shyish when I'm shouting out loud 
I feel so alone in a room full of people 
I'm loudist when I'm in a crowd 
I'm alone, and nobody hears me 
Can't nobody heal me, won't somebody help me 
I'm alone, I just need 
Someone to take my hand and pick me up when I'm feeling down 
Someone to take my heart and give it a home 
Someone to be with me and help me through the times when I'm 
down and lonely 
Someone to be with me when I'm alone 
I'm alone, all alone 
Alone is the way I live, it's not the way I want it but you 
know 
You can't give in, alone is the way I feel, it's so hard to 
understand 
Why I've got to be alone 
 
If you look in my heart you'd see it 
I'm trying to be something better 
If you look in my heart you'd feel it 
I've got to keep moving on 
If you look in my heart you'd know it 
I'm just trying to make my world better 
If you look in my heart you'd see it 
I got to do it alone 
 
I've been down, I've been down 
I've been down, down, down so low 
I've been lost, so lost with no place left to go 
I've had emotions, emotions that you better hope you never 
know 
Sometimes it feels like I just can't take no more 
 
If you look in my heart you'd see it 
I'm trying to be something better 
If you look in my heart you'd feel it 
I've got to keep moving on 
If you look in my heart you'd know it 
I'm just trying to make my world better 
If you look in my heart you'd see it 
I got to do it alone 
 
Seems like things just keep getting further out of hand 
Why can't for once things just go as I plan 
How dare you, how dare you tell me that you understand 
Let me tell you straight out, there ain't nobody here that can 
I'm all alone, I'm so alone, to be alone, just leave me alone 
 
If you look in my heart you'll see it 
If you look in my heart you'd feel it 
If you look in my heart you'd know it 
I'm not trying to make no one bitter 
I'm just alone, leave me alone, alone alone, now leave me 
 
I've lived in places that you wouldn't never ever want to be 
Places where for a minute you couldn't ever stand to be 
I've seen things, I've seen things you'd never want to see 
SO what gives, what gives you the right to be the judge of me 
I'm all alone, I'm so alone, to be alone, just leave me alone 
 
A room full of people, can't nobody help me, I'm alone 
I just need someone to take my hand and pick me up when I'm 
Feeling down, when I'm down 
Someone to take my heart and give it a home, when I'm down 
Someone to be with me and help me through the times 
I'm down and lonely, when I'm down 
Someone to be with me when I'm alone 
I'm alone, all alone 
Alone is the way I live, it's not the way I want it but I 
Know I can't give in 
Alone is the way I feel, there ain't nothing quite as sad as 
A person that's alone

BENEDICTION

 Oh yea, back again. Hope you've enjoyed our little excursions. 
Tipping, toeing thru the mind of a muthafucka that need's 
a little fuck'n stomping on. Yea, but don't take it wrong, 
see we ain't trying to tell you how to think, we're just 
trying to get you to think. And we ain't trying to control 
nobody, we want the people (individually speaking) to be 
in control, to know who they are and what they want to be. 
Yea, and question authority, what the fuck but not for sake 
of argument, but because you took the time to analyze it 
and you found a better fuck'n way, not just a fuck'n excuse 
to complain. And beware of people who try to use you as 
statistic to back their claims of power, that use you simply 
as a vehicle to get themselves where they want to, with no 
reference to your best interest except for their disclaimer 
that their best interest is your best interest. 
And remember... cool is only 3 letters away from fool!

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
BUILT TO SURVIVE

 [Muir] 
 
You've heard about the war in my head 
And I've been known to wake the dead 
I'm not evil just possessed to skate 
And feeling like shit, just don't feel great 
 
Built to survive, 
Built to survive, 
Built to survive, 
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive 
 
So much time spent alone 
And I'm still searching for my home 
 
Built to survive, 
Built to survive, 
Built to survive, 
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive 
 
Had my scrapes with the law 
Is that your mommy that I saw ? 
They tried to ban us from L.A. 
But every dog has his day 
 
Built to survive, 
Built to survive, 
Built to survive, 
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive 
And we're built to survive 
 
It's 1999 and going cyco's all that's on my mind 
 
Controlled by hatred lost again 
 
What I don't need is a friend 
I want more you fascist pig 
We are family, we live to live 
 
Built to survive, 
Built to survive, 
Built to survive, 
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
CAN'T STOP

 There's a place I try to go, so far from here 
I close my eyes, I try to, to disappear 
I look around in my own way 
But what I see I never, never really know 
I wander 'round until I feel it coming on and then it's 
It's time to go 
I don't want to be here, falling out of place 
Confusion's the consensus, fighting for my space 
 
Can't stop the running, can't stop the running 
The runaway emotions in me 
Now you got them running, can't stop the running 
The runaway emotions in me 
 
I lived it, I live it, it's not easy to say 
I felt it, I feel it, it's just another day 
It scares me, why does it dare me 
You know it aint a fair fight 
Pain overtakes me, it tries to break me 
You know that something aint right 
 
Now you got them running, can't stop the running 
The runaway emotions in me 
Now you got them running, can't stop the running 
The runaway emotions in me 
Set my body free 
 
They don't make no seatbelt for the mind. 
So I can't fasten up for this ride... 
 
Running away, can't stop the runaway emotions 
Not right, can't fight 
Can't stop the runaway emotions 
Fighting, hiding, can't stop the runaway emotions 
Hypnotized, paralyzed 
Can't stop the runaway emotions 
 
Can't stop the running, can't stop the running 
The runaway emotions in me 
Now you got them running, can't stop the running 
The runaway emotions 
 
I hate it, I hate me, like my consistency 
I've seen it, I see it, I'm talking literally 
So much lying, too much denying 
It's time to face the facts 
You can't help me 
These cards were dealt me 
Play out the final act 
 
Now you got them running, can't stop the running 
The runaway emotions in me 
You got them running, can't stop the running 
The runaway emotions in me 
Set my body free 
 
Oh no, you really done it this time 
 
Can't stop the runaway emotions 
Can't stop the runaway emotions 
 
There's a place I try to go, so far from here 
I close my eyes but I can't, can't disappear

CHOOSING MY OWN WAY OF LIFE

 My life 
People don't try to tell me how to live my life 
Don't try to fill me up with false hopes and lies 
Show me the truth they say they'll show the light 
Don't try to tell me I'm wrong when I know I'm right 
Cause I don't need it, I don't need it, all I need is 
Choosin' my own way, choosin' my own way of life 
 
I'm mad as hell and I ain't gonna take it 
And if you think I am I think you're fuckin' mistaken 
Lock me in, but you can't lock me out 
You can cut off my tongue, but I'll still scream and shout 
 
Choosin' my own way of life what up? 
Cause I'm choosin' my own way of life 
 
I'd rather have a penny than a heart of gold 
I'd rather die young than do as I'm told 
I was never one to turn down a fight 
I gotta sleep all day so I can rage rage rage all night 
 
Hell I don't need it, I don't need it, all I need is 
My destination is my own decision 
Living fast is my only religion 
Trust no one cause I'm no fuckin' fool 
Learn on my own I don't need no school 
 
Choosin' my own way of life what up 
Choosin' my own way of life straight out 
Choosin' my own way of life ain't it my life 
Choosin' my own way of life and I don't need nobody else

EMOTION NO. 13

 I wish so hard that I could be just like the 
...one you want me to 
But it doesn't seem to work though I'm trying. 
I try so hard to do what's right, to be so good, 
...to make you proud, but it never seems to satisfy you. 
It's just the person that you want,...it's not the person that 
I am. 
The conflict inside's horrifying. 
I want so much for you to think of me as a person 
...that deserves your respect & attention. 
I wonder if I'll ever do the things you want...(the way you 
want) 
When I don't even know what I want yet. 
It's not that I'm rebelling against the person you are 
It's just that I don't know who I am. 
All I know is it hurts, oh how it hurts 
Oh God, do you know how I'm hurting? 
There's an emotion in me. There's an emotion in me 
Emotion No. 13 
 
Look into my eyes, you'll see I'm not lying. 
Emotion No. 13 easy cryin' 
Don't ask me how I know, but I'm dying 
 
Emotion No. 13 blows my mind away 
Emotion No. 13, it blows me away 
 
Look into my eyes, you'll see I'm not... 
Emotion No. 13, says I'm... 
Don't ask me how I know, but I think I'm... 
Don't ask me how I know, but I think I'm dying,...dying, dy 
ing, dying 
 
All I know is it hurts, oh how it hurts 
Oh God do you know how I'm hurting? 
There's an emotion in me, there's an emotion in me 
Emotion No. 13 
 
Look into my eyes, you'll see I'm not lying 
Emotion No. 13, feels like I'm dying

EVIL

Cooking up the hate du jour, the symptom is the cure 
And I'm gonna get evil evil 
It's the last thing that I wanted 
But it's the first thing I should get 
Make mine evil locked in evil 
 
As my resistance is spent my actions get all bent 
And it's time to get evil evil 
My morals reach the junction 
Where my conscience stops its function 
And I'm gonna get evil evil 
It's the last thing I was thinking 
So it's thing that I'll do 
 
Evil evil evil evil

FEEDING THE ADDICTION

 [Mike Muir/Mike Clark] 
 
Taste like addiction 
Smells like addiction 
This is addiction 
 
Feeding the addiction 
Feeding the addiction 
Feeding the addiction 
 
You haven't eaten in days and your gums are bleeding 
Swearing to God the pipe's all you're needing 
It's robbing or stealing or turning a trick 
You do whatever it takes to suck on the Devil's dick 
 
The more you feed it, the harder it is to tame 
Taking in the Beast, playing it like a game 
Lying to yourself saying the same old shit 
 I don't need it, I just don't want to quit 
 
Taste like addiction 
Smells like addiction 
This is addiction 
 
Feeding the addiction 
Feeding the addiction 
Feeding the addiction 
 
The hunger of addiction calls 
There's nothing romantic about going through withdrawals 
You're craving a sample well, here's just a taste 
Picking and scratching the scabs on your face 
 
Your life support system's a syringe 
Killing a piece of your soul every time you binge 
Praying to God and begging for forgiveness 
Knowing damn well that you can't keep going on like this 
 
This is addiction 
Feed the addiction 
This is addiction 
 
Taste like addiction 
Smells like addiction 
This is addiction 
 
I won't give up the plot but here's a few surprises 
Muscle spasms, you're puking as your temperature rises 
Led off to slaughter like a heard of cattle 
The demons inside have won the battle 
 
The Devil takes another soul to burn 
What does it take for another fool to learn 
The ritual's over as another one dies 
The ritual begins as another one tries 
 
It's a feeding time... 
It's your feeding time 
It's a feeding time... 
It's your feeding time 
It's a feeding time... 
It's your feeding time 
It's a feeding time... 
Feeding...the monster! 
 
Cursing at God and praying to die... 
Cursing at God and praying to die... 
Cursing at God and begging to die... 
Cursing at God and begging to die... 
 
Taste like addiction 
Smells like addiction 
This is addiction 
 
Feeding the addiction 
Feeding the addiction 
Feeding the addiction 
 
Cursing at God and praying to die... 
 
Cursing at God and praying to die...

GIVE IT REVOLUTION

 Throughout all time and history 
The world's been mauled tyranny 
Now we're refusing to take it 
The worst evil the world has saw 
Were crimes defended by the law 
Deny our rights and we'll break it 
You got to break the chains that hold you down 
Crush the tyrants to the groud 
Freedom cannot be legislated 
We'll bow down to no other one 
The Father and His Son 
They can't deny what he's created 
Most wars never should have been thought 
But this is a war that must be fought 
We'll take a wrong and we'll right it 
The greatest weapon of the fascist 
Is the tolerance of the pacifist 
We've got to stand up and fight it 
We'll give it 
 
You got to give it revolution, give it revolution 
We're gonna give it revolution, give it revolution 
You got to give it revolution, give it revolution 
We're gonna give it revolution 
 
Well you can put a bullet in my head 
But you can't kill a word I've said 
You got the disease, I got the solution 
No matter how much or more you try, 
you can never ever make this martyr die 
I give it revolution 
Revolution! 
You could put a bullet in my head 
But you can't kill a word I've said 
Give it revolution 
No matter how or what you try 
You can never ever make a martyr die 
Give it revolution

HALF WAY UP MY HEAD

 [Muir, Pleasants] 
 
I don't know what is it 
But I'm acting like I know 
I don't like what I see 
But I never let it show 
You can not understand 
What you were not meant to find 
So I lock it in a vault 
Halfway up my head 
Halfway up my head 
 
Halfway up head 
Halfway up my head that's where it got stuck 
If you're trying to change me well you're just out of luck 
I know what I am and how I must be 
Halfway up my head 
 
[Chorus:] 
Halfway up my head 
It got stuck 
Halfway up my head 
 
Halfway up my head in a back of a file 
I put up a front with a wink and a smile 
All of the things that you've done and you've said 
Halfway up my head Halfway up my head 
 
[Chorus] 
 
When I don't know what to think 
Then I don't know what to say 
When I don't know what to do 
I still do it anyway 
 
So if I sound confused 
You're listening all wrong 
I take it piece by piece 
And I cut what gets to long 
Halfway up my head 
 
Halfway up my head 
That's where it got lost 
Don't like what you said so the message got tossed 
You can not lock up what was meant to run free 
The spirit in me, the spirit in me 
I don't ask for no help and I won't

HEARING VOICES

 I got home kind of late last night 
My mind wasn't clear, but I could tell something wasn't right 
 
So silent I could hear my heart pump 
But then I heard a sound that made me jump 
 
I tried to get real brave, tried to look around 
I tried to find out where came that sound 
The re I looked, the less I could see 
But the voices keep calling, calling out to me 
 
I hear voices when I'm all alone 
Hearing voices but there's nobody home 
Hear the voices could it be they're calling out to me 
Hearing voices I look, why can't I see 
I hear voices can't stop those voices 
 
It happened again the very next day 
I still couldn't understand what they were trying to say 
Could only get the courage to open up one eye 
Couldn't see nothing, but the voices they don't lie 
 
I searched and searched but not a soul I found 
Pretty damn sure no one was around 
The more I looked the less I could see 
Then I realized the voices were calling from me 
 
Are they demons or are they angels or am I crazy 
 
Now the voices I start to understand 
They have to do with the master plan 
You think about what you'd do 
Cause one day the voices will be calling out to you 
The voices I hear now I know are true 
They come not from one but they come from two 
The real point is what I'm missing 
From which voice will I listen 
 
I hear voices 
Hearing voices 
Do you hear the voices? 
Can't stop the voices

HEAVEN

 [Muir, Clark] 
 
I'm so excited today I'm gonna die 
But I'm going to heaven so there's no reason to cry 
God says he loves me and I love him too 
Yes I have struggled, but but now suffering's through 
 
I don't want you to cry 
I just wanna say 
I'm so excited today I'm gonna die 
But I'll live forever so it's not really goodbye 
God has a plan for me and a plan for you 
 
So there's no reason to cry 
There's no reason to cry 
Cause I'm going to heaven 
I'm going to heaven 
Yes I'm going to heaven 
I'm going to heaven 
 
Over head such a shinning light 
As playful angels hover in flight 
In the blindingly brilliant pure white 
A sensation so peacefully 
My soul rises separates from my body 
The pearly gates I can now clearly see 
I've gone to heaven 
Hallelujah 
I'm so excited again I'll never die 
I'm up heaven so there's no reason to cry

HOW WILL I LAUGH TOMORROW

 Here I sit and watch my world come crumbling down 
I cry for help but no one's around 
Silently screaming I bang my head against the wall 
It seems like no one cares at all 
Always an emotion, but how can I explain 
How can I explain 
Kind of like the scent of a rose 
With words I can't explain 
The same with my pain 
Caught up in emotion Goes over my head 
Goes over my head 
Sometimes I got to think to myself is this life or death 
Am I living or am I dead 
The clock keeps ticking but nothing else seems to change 
Problems never solved, just rearranged 
And when I think about all the times that I've had 
So few good So many bad 
I search for personality and I look for things I can not see 
 
Love and peace flash through my mind 
Pain and hate are all I find 
Find no hope in nothing new 
Never had a dream come true 
Lies and hate and agony 
Thru my eyes that's all I see 
If I'm gonna cry 
Will you wipe away my tears? 
If I'm gonna die 
Lord please take away my fear 
Before I drown in sorrow 
Last thing that I'll say 
How will I laugh tommorow 
If I can't even smile today 
Today today when I can't even smile today 
Today today when I can't even smile today 
How will I laugh tommorow when I can't even smile today 
How will I laugh tommorow when I can't even smile today

HOW WILL I LAUGH TOMORROW

 [Mike Clark/Mike Muir] 
 
Here I sit and watch my world come crumbling down 
I cry for help but no one's around 
Silently screaming as I bang my head against the wall 
It seems like no one cares at all 
 
Always an emotion, but how can I explain; how can I explain? 
Kind of like the scent of a rose, with words I can't explain, the same with my pain 
Caught up in emotion, goes over my head; goes over my head! 
Sometimes I got to think to myself is this life or death, am I living or am I dead 
 
The clock keeps ticking, but nothing else seems to change 
Problems never solved, just rearranged 
And when I think about all the times that I've had 
Some were good most were bad 
 
I search for personality and I look for things I cannot see 
Love and peace flash through my mind; pain and hate is all I find 
Find no hope in nothing new and I never had a dream come true 
Lies and hate and agony; thru my eyes that's all I see 
 
If I'm gonna cry, will you wipe away my tears? 
And if I'm gonna die, Lord please take away my fear 
Before I drown in sorrow, I just want to say; 
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today 
 
Today today; when I can't even smile today 
Today today; when I can't even smile today 
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today 
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today 
 
You think it's so funny... 
...laugh at this! 
 
So when I look outside my room 
I see the world, but not the reason 
What is done to me is not fair 
You call it fair I call it treason 
But I don't know what to do 
Give me a sign I'll take whatever 
But if you want me here I am 
Ain't gonna die forever 
 
And I tried to hold ya 
But you just turned away 
And I tried to tell ya 
But not a word I say 
I cried out so loudly 
But you just covered your ears 
And gave me all the signs 
That you don't want my tears 
 
So if you want me here I am 
I sit and wait your decision 
But my body fights my mind 
I headed straight for a collision 
So am I getting near or am I still 
Looking in all the wrong places 
But the only thing that seems to change 
Are the looks on the faces... 
 
Doesn't anyone...seems like no one cares at all 
I search for personality and look for things I cannot see 
Does anyone even care at all? 
Love and peace flash through my mind; pain and hate is all I find 
Seems like no one cares at all 
Find no hope in nothing new and I never had a dream come true 
Does anyone even care at all? 
Lies and hate and agony; thru my eyes that's all I see 
Seems like no one cares at all 
 
How will I laugh tomorrow? 
How will I laugh tomorrow? 
How will I laugh tomorrow? 
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today 
 
Today today; when I can't even smile today 
Today today; when I can't even smile today 
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today 
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today...

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
HUMAN GUINEA PIG

 [Suicidal Tendencies] 
 
[From F.N.G. compilation, 1992] 
 
Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light 
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight 
The scalpels hovers over me, the incision is made 
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration 
 
They said it was for science 
But I'm the human guinea pig 
The guinea pig 
The guinea pig 
The guinea pig 
The guinea pig 
The guinea pig 
 
My sleep has been altered, I open my eyes 
The nightmare continues, I see through their lies 
The papers keep turning, the tests never ends 
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration 
 
They said it was for science 
But I feel like the human guinea pig 
 
Time may have passed on, but I won't soon forget 
The old sensation, pure frustration of a human guinea, guinea pig 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
I AIN'T LIKE YOU

 [Muir] 
 
Too much time on my hands 
Too much salt in my wounds 
Too much pain in my heart 
Too many things to regret 
I've been thinking 
The cause of my confession 
I've been thinking 
The cause of my oppression 
I've been thinking 
What's causing my depression 
I've been thinking 
Because of my depression 
Won't do that change again 
Continuous lies never end 
 
I'd hate myself if I thought like you 
I'd have to hate myself to do the things you do 
Cause I ain't like you 
I ain't like you 
 
Too much getting no where 
Too much waiting to see 
Too many lies have been told 
Too many things thought in my head 
I've been thinking 
The cause of my confession 
I've been thinking 
The cause of my oppression 
I've been thinking 
What's causing my depression 
I've been thinking 
Because of my depression 
Stand up small hypocrite 
Your full of lies your full of shit 
 
I hate myself sometimes that's true 
But I can't hate myself enough to be like you 
 
I ain't like you 
I ain't like you 
I ain't like you 
I ain't like you 
 
Dirty job rearrange 
Smoke it up just taken change 
I can not hate myself 
I can not hate myself enough to be like you 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
I FEEL YOUR PAIN AND I SURVIVE

 [Rocky George/Mike Muir] 
 
Survive 
You can not stand a single word I say 
But you manage to hear every word anyway 
Your eyes they always seem to be fixed on me 
But not for love but for money 
 
[CHORUS] 
You say nothing yet I still hear 
I am the thing that you most fear 
I cause the pain deep in your heart 
O, how I love to tear your world apart 
Well I feel your pain and I survive 
And I survive 
 
I see your anger, I can hardly wait 
How it feels so good to cause you such hate 
Tried to ignore me. Thought I'd go away 
But I'm back for good. I'm here to stay 
 
[CHORUS] 
 
You thought that you could get the best of me 
To put me down, it seemed, so easily 
I take such pride in the work I do 
You hoped I'd fail but I'm not like you 
 
[CHORUS] 
 
I feel your pain so I survive

I SAW YOUR MOMMY

 Yesterday, as I went out of the house 
I saw a body lying down quiet as a mouse 
Lying face down in the sewer 
I got up closer and realized that I knew her 
All her organs coming from her inside 
Slashed up skin sliced up hide 
Turned her over and saw the tire tracks on her head 
That's when I realized she was dead 
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead 
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead 
 
Twisted body chopped off feet 
Her body was minced meat 
Bugs crawling on her arms 
She's dead, can't do no harm 
Gnarled up legs, broken and bent 
Her last breath has been spent 
 
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead 
I watched her as she bled 
Chewed off toes on her chopped off feet 
I took a picture cause I thought it was neat 
But the thing I like seeing the best 
Was the rodents using her hair as a nest 
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead 
I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead 
 
I saw your mommy nnd your mommy's dead 
I saw her lying in a pool of red 
I think it's the greatest thing I'll ever see 
Your dead mommy lying in front of me 
I'll always remember her lying dead on the floor 
I hope she dies twenty times more 
I saw your mommy and your mommy is dead 
I saw your mommy and your mommy is dead

I WOULDN'T MIND

 I wouldn't mind. 
 
Every messed up feeling has its day 
Every screwed up person gets revenge 
Every jacked up moment will come back 
Every twisted thought will have its shot 
 
I wouldn't mind seeing you shaken with fear 
I wouldn't mind hearing you screaming in pain 
I wouldn't mind hearing you cry like a baby 
I wouldn't mind hearing you beggin' for your life 
 
Makes me feel the joy rise thru my soul 
Makes me think that there's hape after all 
Makes me wanna shout and jump for joy 
Makes me feel the purpose after all 
 
I wouldn't mind seeing you shaken with fear 
I wouldn't mind seeing you screamin' in pain 
I wouldn't mind seeing you dead! 
I wouldn't mind.I wouldn't mind. 
I wouldn't mind seeing blood squirting from your veins 
I wouldn't mind hearing you beg for your life 
I wouldn't mind.I wouldn't mind seeing you dead

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
INSTITUTIONALIZED

 Sometimes I try to do things and it just doesn't work out the way I wanted 
to. 
I get real frustrated and I try hard to do it and I take my time and it 
doesn't work out the way I wanted to. 
It's like I concentrate real hard and it doesn't work out 
Everything I do and everything I try never turns out 
It's like I need time to figure these things out 
But there's always someone there going 
 
Hey Mike: 
You know we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately.You 
know, maybe you should get away and maybe you should talk about it, maybe 
you'll feel a lot better 
 
And I go: 
No it's okay, you know I'll figure it out, just leave me alone I'll figure 
it out. You know I'll just work by myself. 
 
And they go: 
Well you know if you want to talk about it I'll be here you know and you'll 
probably feel a lot better if you talk about it. 
 
And I go: 
No I don't want to I'm okay, I'll figure it out myself and they just keep 
bugging me and they just keep bugging me and it builds up inside and it 
builds up inside. 
 
So you're gonna be institutionalized 
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes 
You won't have any say 
They'll brainwash you until you see their way. 
 
I'm not crazy institutionalized 
You're the one who's crazy institutionalized 
You're driving me crazy institutionalized 
 
They stuck me in an institution 
Said it was the only solution 
to give me the needed professional help 
to protect me from the enemy, myself 
 
I was in my room and I was just like staring at the wall thinking about 
everything but then again I was thinking about nothing 
And then my mom came in and I didn't even know she was there she called my 
name and I didn't even hear it, and then she started screaming MIKE! MIKE! 
And I go: 
What, what's the matter 
And she goes: 
What's the matter with you? 
I go: 
There's nothing wrong mom. 
And she goes: 
Don't tell me that, you're on drugs! 
And I go: 
No mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, why don't 
you get me a pepsi. 
And she goes: 
NO you're on drugs! 
I go: 
Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking. 
She goes: 
No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't act that way! 
I go: 
Mom just give me a Pepsi please 
All I want is a Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me 
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me. 
Just a Pepsi.

Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves 
Drug you up because they're lazy 
It's too much work to help a crazy 
 
I'm not crazy institutionalized 
You're the one who's crazy institutionalized 
You're driving me crazy institutionalized 
 
They stuck me in an institution 
Said it was the only solution

achair and they sat down, they go: 
Mike, we need to talk to you 
And I go: 
Okay what's the matter 
They go: 
Me and your mom have been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of 
problems, you've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna 
hurt somebody, we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself. 
So we decided that it would be in your interest if we put you somewhere 
where you could get the help that you need. 
And I go: 
Wait, what do you mean, what are you talking about, we decided!? My best 
interest?! How can you know what's my best interest is? How can you say what 
my best interest is? What are you trying to say, I'm crazy? When I went to 
your schools, I went to your churches, I went to your institutional learning 
facilities?! So how can you say I'm crazy. 
 
They say they're gonna fix my brain 
Alleviate my suffering and my pain 
But by the time they fix my head 
Mentally I'll be dead 
 
I'm not crazy institutionalized 
You're the one who's crazy institutionalized 
You're driving me crazy institutionalized 
 
They stuck me in an institution 
Said it was the only solution 
To give me the needed professional help 
To protect me from the enemy, myself 
 
It doesn't matter how's this childs play planned to turn out anyhow.

IT'S GOING DOWN

 It's going down in my dark side 
My mind starts sweating, my heart 
It starts a chain reaction 
That's how the pain it all starts 
 
It's going down where no one can see 
It's a sad sad sight 
The feeling just gets stronger 
I see you, I just put on a smile 
I try to cover it up 
But I can't take it too much longer 
 
Time stands still, as I lie in place 
I try to block out the pitch 
In my head that keeps ringing 
So I pound and pound on myself 
I try to wake myself up 
But I can't cause I'm not dreaming 
 
It's going down in my dark side 
With no release or escape 
Doesn't believe in forgiveness 
It's an emotional rape 
 
It's going down where no one can see 
It's a sad sad sight 
No suspense as what will follow 
Fractured terror fills my peace 
Shocks my senses 
Leave me empty sad and hollow 
 
Time stands still, as I lie in place 
I try to block out the pitch 
In my head that keeps ringing 
So I pound and pound on myself 
I try to wake myself up 
But I can't cause I'm not dreaming 
 
It's goin' down it's goin' down 
It's goin' down it's goin' down 
It's goin' down it's goin' down 
It's goin' down it's goin' 
It's goin' down 
 
It's going down in my dark side 
Shivers and shakes through my soul 
Ration surveys the damage 
There's nothing left to control 
 
It's going down now, I'm face to face 
With the hollowness 
That echoes in this darkness 
How can I fight when I cannot see what to fight 
Reluctantly how can I even stop this 
All hell is breaking loose 
Now panic rules as emotions blaze on fire 
 
I'm goin' down down down down down 
I'm goin' down 
I'm so damn tired 
 
It's goin' down it's goin' down 
It's goin' down it's goin' down 
It's goin' down it's goin' down 
It's goin' down it's goin'

I got a story to tell, now listen up real well 
Pay attention this way to what I got to say 
Took it to the street, rap to the people we meet 
Now we're rocking out hard to the Suicidal beat 
Tried to deny our right, so we're putting up a fight 
Just doing our thang, they tried to call it a gang 
Saw the way we look, that's all that it took 
That's all she wrote, they had their scapegoat 
 
Dressed down, homeboyz, minority join the Army 
 
We're the few, we're the proud, we like to jam it loud 
The music we play won't have it any other way 
We're armed to the bone with our music and our tone 
Recruiting on the street fwith the sound of our beat 
Growing larger every day and every time we play 
Don't need no college plan, we're just a hard rocking band

Do what you must do, but this ain't the place for you 
You got no right but if you start a fight 
We'll be rockin' your head but with our fists instead

JUST ANOTHER LOVE SONG

 Well I just had to turn off the radio 
But not before I heard thirteen songs about love in a row 
Well I don't know what the next song's gonna be 
But I know how the words are gonna go 
They'll be singing Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby I 
love you so 
So won't everybody sing along cause her comes just another 
love song 
 
I need you like I need a hole in my head 
I need someone to steal my money and wish I were dead 
I need someone to always put me down 
And everywhere I go she wants to hang around 
 
Do you really even think dreams come true 
Do you really even think you'll find something wonderful and 
new 
Do you really even think someone's waiting for you 
Do you really even thiink that love is near 
Do you really even think it's me dear 
Do you really even think I want to hear but I still say 
I won't fall in love today 
 
I need a chick who's got expensive taste 
Who's not afraid of whose money she wastes 
You expect me to buy you a diamond ring! 
Well I suspect I'll buy you not a thing! 
 
Well I could tell you you're the only one I love 
And how your eyes sparkle like the stars above 
And that I carry a picture of you in my heart 
And as long as we live we'll never be apart 
And that you're the most important person in my life 
But I can't handle a girlfriend, how am I gonna handle a wife 
 
Love hate love hate love hate love hate love hate love hate 
love hate love hate 
I love, love, love to hate you but I'd hate, hate, hate to 
love you 
 
I could promise all my love to you 
But that would take me only a second or two 
And if you're waiting to be my one and only 
You're gonna find out what it's like to be awfully lonely 
Your song was alright for awhile But now your tune's gone out 
of style 
 
You want to cuddle and hug all night 
But I'm going out with my friends tonight 
And I don't need someone to act like my mother 
I already have one I don't need another 
 
But she sure looks fine 
After a bottle of wine 
And she's out of sight 
When my mind's not right 
And I'll promise you anything dear

LOOKING IN YOUR EYES

 [Louiche/Mike Muir] 
 
I see destruction as it rages through your veins 
I see depression as it fills your heart with pain 
I see the cure you found, your artificial peace 
I see your body rot, your solution now has it's feast 
 
And now I look, I look in your eyes 
Looking in your eyes 
Looking in your eyes 
Looking in your eyes 
Looking in your eyes 
 
What I see in your eyes 
I can see, they tell no lies 
Looking in your eyes 
 
I see salvation oh so close, but yet so far 
I see the gilmmering of the holy star 
I see your future, it's a nightmare and I lie 
But you refused my help, now I have no more strength to try 
 
Now I see, I see the lies 
Looking in your eyes 
In your eyes I see the lies 
 
What I see in your eyes 
I can see, you tell no lies 
Looking in your eyes 
 
Looking through my eyes 
 
Well I would die for you 
I've died enough now I'm through 
But one day you will see 
What won't but what should B T F. Please stay. 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
LOST AGAIN

 Lost it! I'm caught in a rage 
Like an animal locked in a cage 
Now I look into the barrel of a gauge doom! 
Made me into a fool 
Experimented on me like an animal 
Turned me into a common criminal criminal! 
I lost it, but I gotta get with it 
Motherfucker, now you're gonna get it 
I ain't one that'll sit and forget it 
 
I got into a war I can never win 
Where the nightmare never ends 
And I don't know what I'm saying 
Got into a war with reality 
That motherfucker it was waiting for me 
And I lost again! 
I lost again! 
 
Took my dreams, ya left them there shattered 
Took my hopes, ya dug in them and they splattered 
Took my mind like it didn't even matter 
Entered a world that I didn't belong 
Thought I could take it but I stayed too long 
Thought I could handle it, boy was I wrong! 
 
Fighting a war I can never win 
Where the nightmare never ends 
And I'm not into playing 
Got into a war with reality 
That motherfucker it was waiting for me 
And I lost again! 
 
Lost it! Lost again! 
Lost it! Lost again! 
Lost it! Lost again! 
I lost it! 
 
I went to war with reality 
That motherfucker he was waiting for me 
I never thought that this could happen to me damn! 
Down so low that I can't no higher 
When I was burning you put wood on the fire 
You ain't nothing but a goddamn liar liar! 
Took all my strength now I tremble and drop 
You got to be down to go over the top 
Oh, god can't you make the laughter stop? 
 
Died in a war I could never win 
Where the nightmare never ever ends 
And I lost again 
Got into a war with reality 
That motherfucker it was waiting for me 
And I lost again! 
 
Liar, killer! Lost again! 
I lost! 
Murder, killer! Hell I lost again! 
No! No! 
Cleanse me from your evil 
You broke your promises! 
What did I do to deserve this? 
 
No one to save me from it! 
Oh, lord plese have mercy 
And now I've come to see it 
Something's gone wrong with me 
I guess I got lost in reality 
Hell I lost again! 
Sure ain't easy, hell I lost again! 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
LOVE VS LONELINESS

 How can you love someone 
If you think that you're no one 
When you mistreat yourself, 
and think it's all you deserve 
Cause it's so hard to care 
Is this or is it loneliness? 
 
How can you demand respect when you have no respect? 
When you abuse your body, never mind your mind 
And you're your own worst victim 
There'll be no love just loneliness 
 
Why do you force a smile when you know all the while 
That you're burning inside, but don't want no one to know 
The hell that you're in 
As love turns to loneliness 
 
How can you sleep at night? 
When you know it's not alright 
When you wake up in the morning, nothin' has changed 
If you do nothin' about it 
Love becomes loneliness 
Love vs loneliness, love vs loneliness 
 
And when you're down and you think you need something 
The temptations so hard to resist 
But what you grab sure ain't what you needed 
That's not love it's loneliness 
And when you're lonely and think you need someone 
The plot a painful twist 
There ain't no one that can make you feel like someone 
Only you can cure loneliness 
 
How can you be confident when you're all wrong with it 
When you know what you're doing and you're doing it wrong 
It's no misunderstanding 
This ain't love this is loneliness 
How can you love someone if you think that you're no one?

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
MASTER OF NO MERCY

 Fuck it! 
He's a carrier of death, a stork in reverse 
He blesses you with sickness 
Cause love is a curse 
The arsening in your Koolaid, the bomb in your mail, 
He disappears in motion 
But leaves a bloody trail 
 
Drop to your knees, humble you pray 
But can't put off your judgment day 
 
There's a knock at your door, who could it be? 
You got a new friend that's gonna set you free 
He's making a list, he's checking it twice 
No amount of money's gonna stop this vice 
 
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy. You want mercy? 
No fuckin' mercy! Oh no 
With the wink of an eye, a snap of the finger 
Now the smell of death is all that lingers 
A doctor of death with a PhD, a specialist in pure misery 
 
See you fucked with him even though you knew 
And now your worst nightmares all come true 
You scream and shout you beg and plead 
But he's got your soul and that's all that he needs 
 
He's the master, master of no mercy, no mercy, no mercy

Kiss good bye the nuclear arsenal 
A bombs flying off their ramps 
Nuclear bombs explode 
 
Radio active people 
Search for medicine 
Pray for shelter 
Kill for food 
 
Mass starvation 
Contaminated water 
Destroyed cities 
Mutilated bodies 
 
I'll kill myself 
I'd rather die 
If you could see in the future 
You'd know why

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
MONOPOLY ON SORROW

 There's a cold wind in the winter of my mind 
A season that last through all changes in time 
I try so hard sometimes 
I wish there was a raincheck on tommorow 
Not ready to deal with what I don't wanna find 
 
Struggling on, just to hold on 
I just wanna know, why is it me? 
 
In a tear there is a message from the heart 
Detached from the good, it's hope gone astray 
I cry so hard sometimes 
Too scared to think what will bring tommorow 
Already much more than I can handle today 
 
I can't breathe, suffocate as I'm buried by hate 
And so sadly I learn, there's no justice to fate 
I just wanna know why is it me? 
Losing the race with thoughts out of place 
I just wanna, know why is it me? 
 
You aint got a monopoly on sorrow 
You know plenty has made it my way 
You aint got a monopoly on sorrow 
There's plenty that feel just the same 
 
There's a pain so insane that I fight but can't tame 
And my mind battles on as my body lies lame 
 
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts 
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts 
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts 
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts 
Hurts, hurts 
And I know that I know I don't know that I know 
It just would stay clear then I'd see and I'd go 
I just wanna know why it's me 
Aint got a monopoly on sorrow 
 
You, you, you aint got no no, you aint got no no 
You aint got no no, you aint got no no 
There's no monopoly on sorrow 
No monopoly on sorrow 
No monopoly on sorrow 
No monopoly on sorrow no no no 
 
You ain't got no no no, you ain't got no no no 
You ain't got no no no, you ain't got no no no 
No monopoly on sorrow 
Monopoly on sorrow 
Monopoly on sorrow 
No no no no no 
You ain't got no, no no no no 
You ain't got no, no no no no 
You ain't got no, no no no no

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
NO NAME, NO WORDS

 [Louiche/Mike Muir] 
 
I close my eyes, yet I still see 
I can not hide from what's inside of me 
I hear my thoughts, but they're not clear 
And now I tremble with fear 
 
[CHORUS] 
No one can tell me what's sane 
You see the tears I cry 
But you can't feel my pain 
No title can classify me 
I'm a person with feelings 
A number I refuse to be 
 
Don't try to live my life 
You cannot talk for me 
Now I'm on the brink, brink of insanity 
 
Sometimes I stare into space 
I try to think about another place 
Where happiness I'll see 
I'll find a place for me and find some sanity 
 
Sometimes I look at you 
And I wonder what will I do 
Will my mind stay intact 
How will I react, will I do any harm to you 
 
Open my eyes, but I can't see 
Maybe the hatred has blinded me 
There's not a sound, yet I still hear 
Now the pain is so clear 
 
[CHORUS] 
 
Sometimes I stop to think 
Or maybe my thinking just stops 
Doesn't matter anyway 
No one hears what I say, I'm on the brink of insanity 
 
Well I know him but not his name 
In everyone, yet not the same 
Play with the cards i'm dealt, worse I never felt 
I'm playing a sick man's game

How else can I tell you, how else can I show you? 
 
I'm screaming inside, why can't you hear? 
Nobody hears 
You're looking right through me like I'm not here 
Nobody hears 
 
When the last tear falls down 
Nothing gets waqshed away 
Another plea put to rest 
As nobody hears, nobody hears 
 
So what did I do to you 
That makes you run from me 
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself 
Don't understand why nobody hears 
 
You figured it, you shaped it to your perfection 
Nobody hears 
Subtracted my feelings from this equation 
Nobody hears 
 
Is it all in my mind 
Then it would be easy to find 
 
So what did I do to you 
That makes you run from me 
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself 
Don't understand why nobody hears 
 
So if it's all, if it's all in my mind 
Then wouldn't it, wouldn't it 
Wouldn't it be so easy to find 
 
So what do I have to do 
To make you comfort me 
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself 
Don't understand why nobody hears 
 
So I'm sitting here screaming inside myself 
Well I'm sitting here crying inside myself 
So I'm sittin here screaming to nobody else 
Don't understand why nobody hears 
And nobody hears, nobody hears, nobody hears

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
ONE TOO MANY TIMES

 Never good at talking, so many things I couldn't say 
But those thoughts never went away 
And I'm sure you remember, said that all I wanted was sympathy, 
Now add this to your memory 
 
Too many times I felt so sad and lonely 
Too many times I needed someone there 
Too many times I tried to tell you something 
Too many times It seemed like no one cared 
 
And I don't like asking and it's not easy to say... 
I never learned how to pray 
So if you have a moment it means so much to me oh can't you see... 
If you'd just say a prayer for me 
 
Too many times I didn't even have a second 
Too many times you thought I was much too strong 
Too many times you said the feeling wouldn't last forever 
Too many times I proved you so damn wrong 
 
Saw the changes thought they'd go away do you still remember that day 
Can't really fault you only have myself to blame... 
But do you still feel the same 
 
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya? 
But I waited so long for someone to take my hand, and say they understand 
 
And I waited so long for someone to show the way to make a better day 
and I waited so long for someone to spare a kiss for the love I miss 
And I waited so long for you to looke me in the eye 
And say it's worth another try 
But yo keep me waiting waiting too many times 
 
You keep me waiting, one too many, one too many, one too many times, 
Too many times 
One too many one too many one too many times too many times 
Can't you see yo keep me waiting one too many times

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
POP SONGS

 I hate Pop Songs 
They think they're clever, I think they're wrong 
I hate bubble gum punk 
They got the look but the music is junk 
 
I hate anyone that savors 
The foul stench of this months flavor 
And hell is a place that you can go 
If you like disco or techno 
 
Pop songs 
Pop songs 
Pop songs 
Pop songs 
 
Hi boys and girls 
come on and get happy 
 
I hate Puff Daddy 
And his friend the dead fatty 
I hate the grateful dead 
But I'll be grateful when the rest of them are dead 
 
I feel like I'm on pins and needles 
How many bands can rip off the Beatles? 
And every day there is another 
Band that got big by playing a cover 
 
I hate pop songs 
I hate pop songs 
I hate pop songs 
I hate pop songs 
 
lala, lala, lalalalalalalala 
 
I hate Celine Dion 
Titanic Song makes me wanna moan 
And if I hear another love ballad 
I think I'm gonna have to toss my salad and 
 
I hate teen idols 
they got signed by old farts with fancy titles 
There's nothing worse at least to me 
Than stupid lyrics with a lame ass melody 
 
I hate pop songs, pop songs 
I hate pop songs, pop songs 
I hate pop songs, pop songs 
I hate pop songs, pop songs 
 
Pop songs, I hate pop songs 
Pop songs, I hate pop songs 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
POSSESSED

 When I go down the street 
The people watch me shiver and shake 
I'm a prisoner of a demon 
I think my head's about to break 
It stays with me wherever I go 
I can't break away from its hold 
This must be my punishment 
For selling my soul 
 
Too much pressure, my pulse is rising 
My heart is pounding, my head really hurts 
I can't take it, all this pressure 
From all these things inside of me 
Everywhere I look I see them 
Everywhere I go they're at 
What did I do to deserve this 
Why won't they just leave my body 
 
Are they people or are they spirits 
Do they belong to the human race 
Why do they want me so bad 
Why won't they come out of their hiding place 
i can't see them, but I know they're here 
i can feel it in my veins 
All this pressure on my body 
Is causing all my strength to drain 
 
Am I crazy, or am I insane 
Or have I already lost my mind 
Is it real, or is it fake 
Or am I in a permanent bind 
Am I in power or am I a slave 
Who in hell is in control 
Am I still living, or am I dead 
Do I still have a soul 
 
I know I can't keep going this way 
I have to give my mind some leisure 
If I keep on going like this 
I never again will taste pleasure 
If they will not break the oath 
I will have to disband 
I have lost all control 
this thing has now taken command

POSSESSED TO SKATE

 [Louiche/Mike Muir] 
 
Let's skate! 
 
Seemed like such an innocent toy 
He was the All American boy 
Got a skate at eight years old 
Now the story can be told 
 
Beware he's possessed to skate! 
 
Skating takes him up in height 
He's a pilot on a modern flight 
See him flying through the air 
If he don't land then he don't care 
 
[CHORUS] 
Cause he rips he rips 
When he skates he skates 
Cause he never hesitates 
He's the wizard on the wheels 
Like a modern gladiator ain't got no fears 
So skate 
 
He shoots the pool like a launching pad 
If it ain't insane then you can't get rad 
Skating is all that's on his mind 
He's skating radical all the time 
 
[CHORUS] 
 
Beware he's possessed to skate! 
 
Looks like a magic carpet ride 
Six foot airiels inverts backside 
Optical illusion it must be 
He redefines insanity 
 
[CHORUS] 
 
Doesn't understand why you'd wanna walk 
Ain't got time to sit and talk 
Used to be just like you and me 
Now he's an outcast of society 
 
Beware he's possessed to skate! 
 
And the skating's getting radical

SEND ME YOUR MONEY

 Lights, camera, silence on the set 
Tape rolling, 3 2 1 action 
Welcome to the church of Suicidal 
We'll have a service and wonderful recital 
But before we go on, there's something I must mention 
An important message I must bring to your attention 
I was in meditation and prayer last night 
I was awakened by a shining bright light 
Over head, a glorious spirit 
He gave me a message and you all need to hear it 
 Send me your money , that's what he said 
He said to Send me your money 
Now if you can only send a dollar or two 
There aint a hell of alot I can do for you 
But, if you want to see heaven's door 
Make a check out for five hundred or more 
 Send me your money , do you here what I'm saying? 
 Send me your money 
 
Now give me some bass, um yea that's how he likes it 
Now give me some silence, for all you sinners 
Now give me some bass, yea that was funky 
Now take them on home Brother Clark, send me your ...money 
Here comes another con hiding behind a collar 
His only god is the almighty dollar 
He aint no prophet, he aint no healer 
He's just a two bit goddamn money stealer 
Send me your money 
Send it, you got to send it 
Send me your money 
You hear what I'm saying? 
Send it, send it 
Send me your money 
Now how much you give is your own choice 
But to me it's the difference between a prosche and a Rolls 
Royce 
I want you to make it hurt when you dig into your pocket 
I want you to make it hurt! 
We'll take cash, we'll take checks 
We'll take credit cards, we'll take jewelry 
We'll take your momma's dentures if they got gold in them 
So whose gonna be the next king of the fakers 
Whose gonna take the place of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker? 
See my momma, she didn't raise no fool 
Cause you can't put a price on a miracle 
Amen

SORRY ?!

 Seems like such a long time ago, but I don't know if I'm ever gonna let her go. I remember the first time that I met her, I knew she was the one. There couldn't be anybody better. Well, I was lost when I looked in her eyes Well those eyes, those eyes, they made me realize... Sorry...I didn't know what was to be Sorry...I could not see Sorry...Lord how could this be Sorry...It's raining down on me Well, I know it sounds crazy to say. But, in everything I do, I think about that day. Last time I talked to her was on the telephone. She said I know it's been a while, but I don't feel like being alone. I slammed down the phone on the last thing I'd hear her say. Now it's getting harder to live with it every day and I pray, I pray that you can hear me say Sorry...I could not see Sorry...It don't seem fair to me Sorry...Lord, how could this be Sorry...It's raining right down on me Not a day goes by when I do not sit and wonder why this had to be. It don't seem fair to me. No no, it don't seem fair to me. The more I wish and pray, the more it seems I waste away. But it would mean oh so much if I could just reach out and our hands would touch and if I'd just go back again and do it all over it'd have a happy end. I know exactly the way I would start. I'd send her a letter straight from my heart. It doesn't seem fair, why can't I forgive. She was so strung out, she didn't even have a chance to live and it's oh so hard to forgive. Sometimes people think I don't know what to say because I'm looking out in space, but inside I'm praying and I pray, I pray, I pray, pray, pray and then I think about the day she died. About that night and in the morning. I cry cry cry and I try, I try to understand Sorry...I didn't know what was to be Sorry...It don't seem fair to me Sorry...Lord I'll always be Sorry...She died but it's killing me Wondering about that time when it'll be my day And I wonder what I'll do and what she'll say and if I'll have the courage to stay And I'll start by looking her straight in the eye and telling her that I'm Sorry

SU CASA ES MI CASA

 The ticking you hear is your life passing you by ... 
 
Do you feel you're not taken serious? 
That your input is brushed aside? 
That you can get no respect 
That people may even be laughing behind your back 
Does this make you question your self worth? 
Well it should ... because you're worthless! 
Now take the case of the new age cyco 
Confident, commanding respect 
Taking whatever he wants, from wherever it is 
 
I've been thinking, so to speak 
Knees are shaking, tired and weak 
I've been wondering, who I am 
I've been wondering where I am 
 
Su casa es mi casa, porque estoy muy loco 
 
If you have one, I'll have one too 
Not another, the one I took from you! 
Add my numbers, add it up 
I guess I got it ... give it up! 
 
Su casa es mi casa, porque estoy muy loco 
 
Now you've had some time to think 
Why don't you look in the mirror, tell me what you see 
Nah not on the outside, look inside, deep inside 
The true ugliness 
Not the self created coloured hair, piercings hanging out everywhere 
The stuff you try to cover up and deny 
So there's a reason for everything 
Now you let the reason out 
Rising up, I feel it coming, let 'em know it's time! 
 
I'm still wondering, why I am 
Coughing up blood, spitting up phlegm 
So much anger, hostility 
Biting and kicking, inside of me 
I'm fully cyco, partly hexed 
Makes me wonder, who is next 
You need not worry, about what I am 
But you better worry, about where I am! 
 
Su casa es mi casa 
No quieres chingar conmigo 
 
The ticking you hear is your life passing you by ...

SUICIDAL MANIAC

 [Rocky George/Mike Muir] 
 
A birth that came from more than sound 
Now rages on from town to town 
A giant grows more every day 
And now the maniac is here to stay 
 
A feeling you can't kill 
It's the power, it's a will 
Controls your thoughts but you can't see 
 
Just when you thought it safe he suddenly appears 
He feels no pain, he has no mercy or no fears 
He gives the message and your mind is filled with blue 
And now the maniac lives inside of you 
 
[CHORUS] 
He's back. The suicidal maniac. 
 
Each day he grows more and more 
He's bigger now than ever before 
His thoughts he'll compromise on never 
He can't be stopped. He'll live forever 
 
Blast away through the mind 
A power of another kind 
A presence that is growing out of sound 
 
And now it's come, the time the maniac I'll meet 
He takes my hand and now I bow down to his feet 
His love for me is like a father to a son 
And now the maniac and I are one 
 
I bow to his might 
Too powerful to fight 
It's my destiny 
Now the maniac lives inside of me 
 
He's back 
 
An army at his command 
A strength that you can't comprehend 
A force unknown can now be told 
The power of the world he holds 
 
A feeling you can't kill 
It's the power. It's the will 
Controls your thoughts but you can't see 
 
Just when you thought it safe he suddenly appears 
He feels no pain, he has no mercry or no fears 
He gives the message and your mind is filled with blue 
And now the maniac's a part of you 
And the time has come. The maniac you'll meet 
He takes your hand and now you bow down to his feet 
His love for you is like a father to a son 
And now the maniac and you are one

 I've seen pain that'll drive a man further

Refuse to be a martyr

It's a glorious hour 
Say hello to the hate 
Tap into the...

You're scared to look, but I ask 
What's worse than fear?

Say hello to the hate 
Tap into the... 
Don't be afraid, don't run away 
Tap into the power

Don't be afraid because 
Now's the time to explore it 
Drop all the fear, try to deny

THE FEELING'S BACK

 I wrote a letter just the other day to nobody in particular 
But if anyone were to read a bit they'd think I was a bit peculiar 
But it matters not what they think of me, it's only what I know is real 
And so all that's left that matters now is that the feeling's back 
 
The feeling's back and you just can't stop it 
The feeling's back and you just can't stop it 
 
I fought a thousand times I never knew the meaning of the word fear 
Till that one day when I stood alone staring straight into the mirror 
It's not a pretty sight and even worse it's so hard to face 
Until I realize I'm the only one that put me in this place 
 
I'm gonna breathe I'm gonna live that's right nothing's gonna stop me 
I7m gonna shout I'm gonna scream that's right nothing's gonna stop me 
I'm gonna run I'm gonna fly that's right nothing's gonna stop me 
I'm gonna fight I'm gonna win that's right nothing's gonna stop me 
Nothing's gonna stop me, nothing's gonna stop me now... 
Cause the feeling's back and you gotta love the feeling 
 
I dug my hole too deep I couldn't admit, I didn't know when to stop 
But you can only dig your hole six feet until the dirt comes back on top 
I've got a long way left to climb but I'll still look you straight in the eye 
And I can honestly say I'll never quit not even on the day I die 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
THE MIRACLE

 I sailed forever, I sailed so far, and now I know 
just what the consequences are 
I laughed out loudy, while I cried inside 
But I didn't haave the strength to say enough of this ride 
Like a fool I believed in a miracle 
I wanted to forget, of what I'm not sure 
But I found an answer it seemed to be a perfect cure 
 
Controlled my actions, controlled my thoughts 
Controlled my feelings, and now I feel my body rot like a fool 
 
I believed in the miracle 
 
Twisting and I'm turning freezing then I'm burning 
Laughing then I'm crying am I living or am I dying 
Swearing then I'm praying don't even know what I'm saying 
Happy then so sad forgiving then so mad 
 
Do you still, do you still believe, do you still believe in, 
Do you still believe in miracles? 
 
Pushing then pulling who am I fooling 
A friend then a foe do I really even know? 
Love and then hate 
Peace then at war but what am I fighting for 
And you always try to 
Keep me oh so sleepy 
So I can't realize that it's all lies 
And the more it takes hold of me the less chance that I'll ever be free 
And even though I don't believe it's so hard to leave a miracle a miracle 
 
Waiting always hesitating for that perfect day that day was yesterday 
And the more you're gonna wait the more of a chance that it will be too late 
 
How can you afford to wait, you just can't afford to wait 
I shed a tear I won't deny it, but just one tear I already cried it 
And now you'll see me cry no more, don't even know what I was crying for 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
THE PRISONER

 [Louiche/Mike Muir] 
 
You're the prisoner locked in your cell 
You're living in your personal hell 
Invisible bars block your view 
They don't exist except for you 
 
Free, why can't you see how easily 
You could break those bars right down 
New freedom found, travel around 
And find out exactly why 
Give it a try, living the lie 
And try to solve the final clue 
See if it's true, found out just who 
The real enemy is you 
 
Don't be afraid 
Don't be deceived 
A new world for you 
Can be conceived 
 
Don't tell me 'bout how the world isn't fair 
How you'll live your life how you choose 
I don't want to hear another excuse 
How it ain't your fault when you lose 
 
And you're the prisoner 
Your mind's diseased, my mind is cured 
 
I was the prisoner but never again 
My worst enemy is now my friend 
Brainwashed, you'll probably believe 
I gave it up for a new reprieve 
 
Free, why can't you see how easily 
You could break those bars right down 
New freedom found, travel around 
And find out exactly why 
Give it a try, living the lie 
And try to solve the final clue 
See if it's true, found out just who 
The real enemy is you 
 
You say you're political 
I say, Screw that, you're just a fool. 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
TRIP AT THE BRAIN

 I gotta gotta take a trip, gotta take a trip out of this place 
 
I gotta gotta get away, get away from the human race 
I don't know what I'll see, don't even know what I'll find 
I don't know what to pack, never been to a trip at the mind 
 
Trip at the brain. Trip at the brain. Trip at the brain 
Do you know what I'm saying? 
Trip at the brain. Trip at the brain. Trip at the brain 
Well I'm going insane 
 
I took a wrong turn and ended up at my heart 
I t could barely even pump no blood it was so thrashed and 
torn apart 
Thank it for working overtime in pain and misery 
Then I set back on the trail, headed for my destiny 
 
Fly with me 
Flying free 
 
Tripping 
You must be tripping 
Trip, trip, tripping 
Ya ya ya ya you're tripping 
 
I cannot stop this trip, I forgot to pack the brakes 
Crashed straight into a concrete wall of my mistakes 
Ended up in a cemetary of a thousand wasted days 
But that's alright with me, cause that's where most of my 
memories lay

TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT (BUT THEY MAKE ME FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER)

 [Rocky George/Mike Muir] 
 
Welcome to the year of the cyco 
It's been a long, long wait 
Welcome to a modern blitzkrieg 
With peace, I can't relate 
Welcome to death now you'll love it 
Once in a lifetime treat 
Say goodbye to peace and order 
You and my terror will meet 
 
My best friend is misery 
My girlfriend is insanity 
My father is revenge 
 
My love for you I must confess 
With my knife you passed the test 
I'll love you till the end 
 
Evacuation of my mind 
In my body no heart you'll find 
Where there's death I lurk 
 
Empty stare incoherent 
Screams of pain, love to hear it 
Take pride in my work 
 
They say two wrongs don't make a right 
Well maybe that is true 
But I can't describe the feeling I get 
When I take revenge on you 
 
Forgiveness is the key to destruction 
But you can't open my door 
Repentance, you're indecision 
I hesitate no more 
Tradition is the root of all evil 
So now I water the tree 
Salvation, an all time sentence 
So now I walk away free 
 
Two wrongs don't make a right 
But they make me feel a whole lot better 


 

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
WAKING THE DEAD

 Kept in the guard of Mother Nature's womb 
Resting in the safety of their tomb 
Sheltered by six feet of soil and rock 
The spade is the key with which their gate we'll unlock 
Why should they be resting so peacefully 
When we're up above in pure misery 
I don't care that they've already died 
That's not enough to make me satisfied 
 
So we wait till the stroke of the midnight hour 
Then we'll unleas the darkest of power 
Hell's gates will open a new judgment day 
Now is the time that the dead will pay 
Why should they be resting so peacefully 
When we're up above in pure misery 
I don't care that they've already died 
That's not enough to make me satisfied 
Waking the dead, waking the dead, waking the dead 
 
All rise! 
Hell's gates open the earth trembles and shakes 
Now their pardons are over they pray for their mistakes 
Mausoleums firebombed now rage in flames 
When the dead come out their bodies we'll maim 
 
Rob Robbing their graves stealing their bones 
Bang Banging our heads to their screams and their moans 
Fix Fixing the wounds that even time cannot heal 
Soon Soon we will know how good it feels 
 
This is not damnation or an act of God 
Now the dead they rise ripping through the sod 
Purgatory has to wait, but how can this be 
The dead are free the dead are free! 
 
Waking the dead you said that it wouldn't be 
Waking the dead You said that we wouldn't see 
Waking the dead Now the dead stand before our own eyes 
 
Silence is blaring the earth opens wide 
History repeats, reburied they die 
Darkness descends through nature's pores 
They return to their sleep on earth's basement floor 
Now they rest not so peacefully 
As they've had a taste of our misery 
I didn't care that they'd already died 
That wasn't enough to make me satisfied 
 
Return back to their tombs now they lay 
This is no game for the novice to play 
Repeat not a word lest ye be forewarned 
The punishment of Hell's darkness and scorn 
Repeat not a word of the sermon said 
A prayer for the dead, don't play with the dead 
Don't try to comprehend what's going on 
You can't understand, please don't understand 
 
Waking the dead And we'll be 
Waking the dead All rise now 
Waking the dead We're gonna wake the dead 
Waking the dead 
 
I said the words what have I done 
I thought it cool, I thought it fun 
The words I say they start to change 
The syllables now rearranged 
A language I can't comprehend 
I shut my mouth it doesn't end 
The bowels of nature open wide 
I cannot move I cannot hide 
I can't believe the things I see 
The dead are free, the dead are free 
I close my eyes and pray it's not real 
Their presence close coldness I feel 
What have I done Lord please forgive 
Once they died, but now they live 
I wake the dead, I ake the dead, I wake the dead, I wake the 
dead! 
 
Cleanse the lepers 
Cast out the demons 
Wake the dead!

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO

 For a moment it seems 
That this moment won't end 
So I pray for the end 
Wasting my time, waiting for mercy 
You sold me out just for the joy of hurting me 
So I pray for the end 
 
Rest my child and be still 
Tortured thoughts become real 
 
My heart stops such a rush 
Causes me to go numb 
Wonder what next will come 
Sitting alone in my misery 
I'd like to mike. 
 
What more can I do? 
What else could I do? 
Fucked up feelings kill 
What else could I do? 
What else can you do? 
What else could I do? 
 
I lost again, once again 
I don't know where to start 
Now I'm back at the start 
You lied when you told me it would save me 
Now taste the fucked up feelings you gave me 
I lost again, once again

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
WHERE'S THE TRUTH

 Late at night, that's the time I can't forget it 
Sail the darkness but this ain't sleep 
Heard the sound, could it be I got the message 
But the message wasn't intended for me 
Can't you see there's a madman working 
He's putting in overtime 
Too content with the sweet scent of denial 
You're oblivious to the signs 
 
It's a struggle for the reason 
But it's the only thing I know 
 
No surprise, here's more lies and you still are wailing 
What the hell are you saying 
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying 
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why you lying 
Truth abuse, what's the use, it's not a game you're playing 
Do you know what I'm saying 
And you're high high hiding with lie lie lying 
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth 
 
I'm not you, you're not me, that's the difference 
So you can't deny we're the same 
What's the point, that's what sticks huh exactly 
Take a second helping of the blame 
Not a scare not a bomb not a warning 
A condition that no one should doubt 
There's a tick tock tick tock 
Ticking in my head you gotta get out 
 
Yet I cannot deny the reason 
'Cause it's the only thing I know 
 
No remorse, danger course, and you still are wailing 
You don't know what you're saying 
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying 
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why you lying 
Sick in thought, disease you've caught 
Is it a game you're playing, do you know what I'm saying 
And you're high high hiding with lie lie lying 
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth 
 
It's a struggle for the reason 
But it's the only thing I know 
 
Too much tweak, dosage leak 
And you still are wailing, what the hell are you saying 
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying 
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why are you lying 
 
Set to lose, why you choose 
It's not a game you're playing, do you know what I'm saying 
And you're high high hiding with lie lie lying 
Where's the truth, where's the truth 
 
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth 
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth 
You're lying!

YOU CAN'T BRING ME DOWN

 [Mike Muir/Rocky George] 
 
What the hell's going on around here? 
 
First off let's take it from the start 
Straight out can't change what's in my heart 
No one can tear my beliefs apart, you can't bring me 
 
You ain't never seen no one like me 
Prevail regardless what the cost might be 
Power flows inside of me, you can't bring me 
 
Never fall as long as I try 
Refuse to be a part of your lie 
Even if it means I die, you can't bring me 
 
You...can't...bring...me...down! 
 
Who the hell you calling crazy? You wouldn't know what crazy was 
If Charles Manson was eating fruit loops on your front porch.... 
 
Time out let's get something clear 
I speak more truth than you want to hear 
Scapegoat to cover up your fear, you can't bring me 
 
You ain't never seen so much might 
Fight for what I know is right 
What up you got yourself a fight, you can't bring me 
 
Stand up we'll all sing along 
Together ain't nothin' as strong 
Won't quit we ain't in the wrong, you can't bring me 
 
You...can't...bring...me...down! 
 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, no! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, you can't bring me down! 
 
Tell them what's up Rocky! 
 
You...can't...bring...me...down! 
 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, no! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, you can't bring me down! 
 
So why you trying to bring me? 
Well you can't bring me down...No, no, no, no 
Can't bring me down....No, no, no, no, no, no 
Can't bring me down....No, no, no, no, no, no 
Can't bring me down....No, no, no, no, no, no 
So why you trying to bring? 
Well you can't bring me down 
 
Just cause you don't understand what's going on don't mean it don't make no sense 
And just cause you don't like it, don't mean it ain't no good 
And let me tell you something; 
 
Before you go taking a walk in my world 
You better take a look at the real world 
Cause this ain't no Mister Roger's Neighborhood 
 
Can you say feel like shit ? 
Yea maybe sometimes I do feel like shit 
I ain't happy 'bout it, but I'd rather feel like shit than be full of shit!

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
YOU CAN'T BRING ME DOWN

 What the hell's going on around here? 
First off let's take it from the start 
Straight out can't change what's in my heart 
No one can tear my beliefs apart, you can't bring me 
You aint never seen no one like me 
Prevail regardless what the cost might be 
Power flows inside of me, you can't bring me 
Never fall as long as I try 
Refuse to be part of your lie 
Even if it means I die, you can't bring me 
 
You can't bring me down! 
Who the hell you calling crazy? 
You wouldn't know what crazy was if Charles Manson 
...was eating Fruit Loops on your front porch 
 
Time out let's get something clear 
I speak more truth than you want to hear 
Scapegoat to cover up your fear, you can't bring me 
You aint never seen so much might 
Fight for what I know is right 
What up you got yourself a fight, you can't bring me 
Stand up we'll all sing along 
Together aint nothin' as strong 
Won't quit we aint in the wrong, you can't bring me 
 
You can't bring me down! 
 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, no! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, you can't bring me 
down! 
 
Tell them what's up rock! 
You can't bring me down! 
 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, no! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, you can't bring me 
down! 
 
So why you trying to bring me 
So why you trying to bring 
Well you can't bring me down 
 
Just cause you don't understand what's going on 
...don't mean it don't make no sense 
And just cause you don't like it,...don't mean it aint no good 
 
And let me tell you something 
 
Before you go taking a walk in my world, 
...you better take a look at the real world 
Cause this aint no Mr. Rogers Neighborhood 
Can you say feel like shit? 
Yea maybe sometimes I do feel like shit 
I aint happy about it, but I'd rather feel like shit 
...than be full of shit! 
And if I offended you, Oh I'm sorry 
But, maybe you needed to be offended 
But here's my apology and one more thing...Fuck you! 
Cause you can't bring me down 
 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, no! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down! 
Bring me down you can't bring me down, you can't bring me 
down! 
 
You can't bring me down!
