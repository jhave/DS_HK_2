10 LIGHT YEARS AWAY

 Music: Mick Jones, Marti Frederiksen, Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Mick Jones, Marti Frederiksen, Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker 
 
In a run down bed and breakfast 
A room with a view, across the river 
I tried to loos the claustrophobia 
Opened up and find Utopia 
There's no more denying 
As my mind go flying 
10 light years away to save my soul 
10 light years away to change it all 
Whatever it may take I gotta try again 
Girl it's time to start over 
10 light years away 
I'd been watching the reflection 
Of a bamboo in the shade, when I saw her 
A very hot day in Havana 
In a midnight blue lagoon 
I knew she was hiding 
10 light years away so take me home 
10 light years away to change it all 
Help me find today It's been way too long 
Girl it's time to start over 
10 light years away 
There's no more denying 
As my mind go flying 
10 light years away to save my soul 
10 light years away to change it all 
Whatever it may take I gotta try again 
Girl it's time to start over 
10 light years away so take me home 
10 light years away to change it all 
Help me find today It's been way too long 
Girl it's time to start over 
10 light years away

3. PASSION RULES THE GAME

 Music: Herman Rarebell 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Stranded in this town 
My machine slows down 
To take me where the night begins 
I'm playing everywhere 
Loving here and there 
I always take the chance to win 
Drove a million miles 
Gambling rules my life 
I only stop to start again 
 
I reach out through the air 
Good look is everywhere 
Can almost touch it with my hands 
 
Just a little luck tonight 
Will do and dreams come true 
Just a little luck tonight 
I can't stop the wheel 
That turns the ball of steel 
 
When passion rules the game 
I ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames 
 
I'm a stranger in this town 
Life takes me up and down 
I'll break the score until I'm free 
Can't stop to roll the dice 
And in the morning light 
A girl like you is all I need 
 
Don't you need some love tonight 
I do, yes I do 
Don't you need some love tonight 
How can we stand the heat 
When love is all we need 
 
When passion rules the game 
I ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames

A MOMENT IN A MILLION YEARS

 Music: Klaus Meine 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
The lights are slowly fading down 
There's no one else, just you and me 
Nothing ever changed 
I see your faces in the crowd 
It seems I know each one of you 
For all my life 
I wish this night could last forever 
But it's time to go 
I saw you laugh, I saw you cry 
All for one and one for all 
Nothing ever changed 
The way you sang just blew my mind 
It gave me chills from head to toe 
What a glorious night 
To me it could have lasted forever 
But it's time to go 
A moment in a million years 
Is all I've got for you 
A moment in a million years 
To make some dreams come true 
A moment that I won't forget 
Until the day I die 
A moment in a million years 
Called life 
The bus is waiting right outside 
To hit the road and once again 
I leave you all behind 
I chase another dream tonight 
And by the time you'll be home 
I'll be far away 
Nothing seems to last forever 
It's time to go 
A moment in a million years 
Is all I've got for you 
A moment in a million years 
To make some dreams come true 
A moment that I won't forget 
Until the day I die 
A moment in a million years 
Called life

ALEYAH

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker 
 
The easy way 
Is not the way my life will take 
Because the limit is the sky 
The easy way 
Is not the way that I can take 
My life's in pieces half the time 
Dancing on a razor blade 
Break the ice but never break 
Where the time meets destiny 
Take your chance and come with me 
Aleyah 
The easy way 
Is not the way that I can take 
I keep on dancing in the sky 
It's the way 
And not the goal that will make it 
All so special in my life 
Dancing on the pulse of time 
Bring it home across the line 
Come with me 
Aleyah 
Dancing on a razor blade 
Break the ice but never break 
Where the time meets destiny 
Take your chance and come with me 
Aleyah 
Life in the fast lane 
Don't you think baby 
To make it up there 
We gotta be crazy

ALIEN NATION

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
In the heat of the violence 
The night's exploding everywhere 
When hate pulls the trigger 
The devil comes to take his share 
In the garden of Eden 
The time is running out so fast 
Into heat of the demon 
With no escape our die is cast 
 
In the city of angels 
Death is just a moment away 
In the city of angels 
Your future won't see the light of the day 
 
Beware of the alien nation 
Beware of the truth that they seek 
They pray for eternal salvation 
They pray for your sole to keep 
 
On the eve of destruction 
A reign of terror rules the street 
When the heads start rolling 
The devil comes to let it bleed 
 
In the city of angels 
Death is just a moment away 
In the city of angels 
Your future won't see the light of the day 
 
Walk on past the alien nation 
Walk on to the end of your reach 
No fear of the alien nation 
No fear of the hatred they preach 
 
Don't run, there's no place to hide 
Today or tomorrow it will get you 
Don't move, the knife is right at your throat 
And whatever you do, there's no way out 
When the shroud comes down on this place 
To bury us all alive 
We'll know the time has come, to face the heat 
 
Beware of the alien nation 
Beware of the truth that they seek 
They pray for eternal salvation 
They pray for your sole to keep 
Walk on past the alien nation 
Walk on to the end of your reach 
They pray for eternal damnation 
They pray for your sole to keep

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Arrive at seven the place feels good 
No time to call you today 
Encores till eleven then Chinese food 
Back to the hotel again 
 
I call your number the line ain't free 
I like to tell you come to me 
A night without you seems like a lost dream 
Love I can't tell you how I feel 
 
Always somewhere 
Miss you where I've been 
I'll be back to love you again 
 
Another morning another place 
The only day off is far away 
But every city has seen me in the end 
And brings me to you again 
 
Always somewhere 
Miss you where I've been 
I'll be back to love you again

ANOTHER PIECE OF MEAT

 Music: Rudolf Schenker, Herman Rarebell 
Lyrics: Herman Rarebell 
 
Met her down at that Tokyo place 
Loved her pretty face 
I said: Hey, you're alright, so alright! 
I was sitting in her car 
She told me: You're a star and I know you. 
 
She said: Take me home. 
I need love so strong 
Come on and knock me out, oh! 
I've been too long alone 
I want hot love, you know, and I need it now! 
 
She said: Hey, let's go, don't put on a show 
You're just another piece, another piece of meat 
She said: Hey, let's go, don't put on a show 
You're just another piece 
Another piece of meat. 
 
Next day she took me out 
To a rough kick boxing show 
Violence really turned her on, oh no 
She was screaming for more blood 
Loved it more than any drug I couldn't stand it 
 
I said: Hey, let's go, don't put on a show 
You're just another piece, another piece of meat 
Said: Hey, let's go, don't put on a show 
You're just another piece 
Another piece of meat.

ARIZONA

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Herman Rarebell 
 
Arizona really was a gas 
I was screwed up in a total mess 
Mindblowing all the way, you know 
Just out of sight 
Some girl stopped me in the street at night 
Ooh, what a knockout and she felt so right 
Ooh, yeah she took my breath away 
Just out of sight 
 
Loved her in her car 
Took me to the stars 
Babe, we went nuts all the way 
Loved her on the moon 
Morning came too soon 
She got me high and loose, loose, loose 
 
Arizona really feels alright 
Girls swing here and they treat you right 
Have so many special ways, you know 
And that's alright 
Was so hard to leave and say goodbye 
I'd like to stay and have another try 
Mindblowing all the way, you know 
Just out of sight 
 
Loved her in her car 
Took me to the stars 
Babe, we went nuts all the way 
Loved her on the moon 
Morning came too soon 
She got me high and loose, loose, loose 
 
Ooh, what a night 
Such a good time 
Out of sight 
Yeah, what a night

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
If you feel real sad somtimes 
Caught in bad vibrations 
And it seems you've lost your drive 
And your destination 
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by 
Catch the train of better times 
Rock tonight 
 
Hard times go 
As soon as the good times roll 
Hard times go 
As soon as the good times roll 
 
If you feel that all your life 
Is packed with complications 
And almost everything you try 
Ends up in new frustrations 
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by 
Catch the train of better times 
Rock tonight 
 
Hard times go 
As soon as the good times roll 
Hard times go 
As soon as the good times roll

AVE MARIA NO MORRO

 Music: H. Martins 
Lyrics: M. Salinas 
 
Ave Maria del monte preciosita, chiquitita 
es el morro de los negros la mansion. 
Extra o mundo tan desgraciada y tan sencilla, 
ni siquiera una capilla te aprovecha para rezar. 
 
Pero si vive en Tierra y Cielo y [cambiara] 
y la noche con su manto cubre las losas que van a amar 
 
Alla se escucha, al fin del dia una plegaria 
Ave Maria 
Alla se escucha, al fin del dia una plegaria 
Ave Maria 
Ave Maria 
Aunque no tenga capilla, reza la gente sencilla 
 
Ave Maria

Out in the streets 
The dogs are on the run 
The cats are all in heart 
Out in the streets 
Snakes are all around you 
Dirty rats are on their way 
They control you and they'll make you play 
 
Out in the night 
Glaring eyes in darkness 
Tigers wanna fight 
Out in the night 
Spiders all around you 
Spinning webs and make you pray 
Tie you up and you can't get away 
 
Bad boys running wild 
If you don't play along with their games 
Bad boys running wild 
And you better get out of their way 
 
Out in the streets 
The dogs are on the run 
The cats are all in heat 
Out in the night 
Spiders all around you 
Spinning webs and make you pray 
Tie you up and you can't get away

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
How does it fell babe 
To taste sweet revenge 
Do you want me on my knees 
How does it feel babe 
to let me feel your strength 
Don't be cruel, can't you see 
If you don't catch me now 
I can't stop falling down 
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul 
I need your love babe don't tell me no way 
Babe I miss you so much more than words can say 
 
How does it feel babe 
To kill our destiny 
I swear I'm not gonna crawl oh no 
How does it feel babe 
To make a fool out of me 
How can you be so cold 
If you don't catch me now 
I can't stop falling down 
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul 
I need your love babe don't treat me this way 
Ooh I miss you, I miss you 
 
Baby our love's got what it takes 
To give us one more chance to start once again 
Baby our love will find a way 
As long as we believe in love

BIG CITY NIGHTS

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
When the daylight is falling down into the night 
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life 
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill 
But it's more like spinning wheels of fortune 
Which never stand still 
 
Big city, big city nights 
You keep me burning 
Big city, big city nights 
 
When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes 
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side 
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before 
But it's more like looking out for something 
I can't find anymore 
 
Big city, big city nights 
You keep me burning 
Big city, big city nights 
Always yearning 
 
There is no dream 
That you can't make true, if you're looking for love 
But there's no girl 
Who's burning the ice away from my heart 
Maybe tonight! 
 
Big city, big city nights 
You keep me burning 
Big city, big city nights 
Always yearning 
Big city, big city nights 
You keep me burning 
Big city, big city nights 
Always yearning

BLACKOUT

Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell, Sonja Kittelsen 
 
I realize I missed a day 
But I'm too wrecked to care anyway 
I look arownd and and see this face 
What the hell have I lost my taste 
 
Don't want to find out 
Just want to cut out 
 
My head explodes, my ears ring 
I can't remember just where I've been 
The last thing that I recall 
I got lost in a deep black hole 
 
Don't want to find out 
Just want to cut out 
 
Blackout 
I really had a Blackout 
 
I grab my things and make a run 
On my way out, another one 
Would like to know before I stop 
Did I make it or did I flop 
 
Don't want to find out 
Just want to get out 
 
Blackout 
I really had a Blackout 
 
Don't want to find out 
Just want to get out 
 
Blackout 
I really had a Blackout

BLOOD TOO HOT

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I came all around the world just to be with you 
I ve been flying supersonic, between black and blue 
I promised I'd be there 
And now I'm here and I won't go 
Before I give you everything I've got 
 
You left everything behind, just to feel that touch 
To join the family of spiders. really means so much 
There's a storm up in the air 
It's the power we all share 
When it runs through our flesh and blood 
 
lf your blood is so hot 
Stand up and rock with me 
lf your blood is too hot, rock with me 
lf your blood is so hot 
Stand up and rock with me 
lf your blood is too hot, rock with me 
 
I came all around the world, like on flying wings 
To hear you screaming out for more, still means everything 
Raise your hands up in the air 
I swear to you that I'II be there 
I swear it, in the name of rock 
 
lf your blood is so hot 
Stand up and rock with me 
lf your blood is too hot, rock with me 
lf your blood is so hot 
Stand up and rock with me 
lf your blood is too hot, rock with me

BORDERLINE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
You re like a brother, just like no other 
You keep the torch, that eternal flame 
We bought the ticket, that one way ticket 
The hottest seat on the crazy train 
 
lt takes power to walk in our shoes 
lt takes power to walk on 
 
We walk the borderline 
Crossing those ice cold waters 
We jump into the fire 
Riding the wildest storm 
 
We rock the planet, up to the zenith 
Feel that adrenalin overload 
Can't stop the fever, that road fever 
It's in my blood, in every single bone 
 
lt takes power to walk in our shoes 
lt takes power to walk on 
 
We walk the borderline 
Crossing those ice cold waters 
We jump into the fire 
Riding the wildest storm 
Doing it now or never 
We walk into the Iight 
Bringing this baby home 
 
Another day around the corner 
There is sunshine after rain 
This journey is going an forever 
Home is where my heart is 
And I m always on my way 
I don t look back now 
We don t look back now 
 
lt takes power to walk on 
 
We walk the borderline 
Crossing those ice cold waters 
We jump into the fire 
Riding the wildest storm 
Doing it now or never 
We walk into the Iight 
Bringing this baby home

BORN TO TOUCH YOUR FEELINGS

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I was born from the sound oft he strings 
for someone to give everything 
to be a song just for your feeling 
 close your eyes and I'll try to get in 
 to waken your heart like the spring 
'cos I was born to touch your feelings 
 
Steal the time, take a song and be glad 
be free as the birds, don't be sad 
your time will come. I'll make you feel it 
 you're still young like the sun after rain 
 follow the light, it's not in vain 
 and you will see I'll touch your feelings. 
 
You've got your songs, they are everyday 
 for a while, just the only way 
to feel allright... 
 
You were born just to lose or to win 
to be someone's child in the wind 
to live between your mind and feelings 
 find your way, check it out, learn each day 
 follow the light , it's not in vain 
 and you will see I'll touch your feelings. 
 
You've got your songs, they are everyday 
for a while. just the only way 
to feel allright ...

BUT THE BEST FOR YOU

 Music: Klaus Meine 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Let me tell you something 
 
In the darkness of the room 
I'm leaning back against the wall 
Try to walk on broken glass 
A cut so deep just hurts so bad 
 
I remember what you said 
Tears were rollin' down your face 
And after all's been said and done 
You're a woman, I'm a man 
Could I turn back the time again 
 
You must know by now 
I won't let you down 
Whatever comes along the way 
Don't you agree that one thing is true 
I'm not the best, but the best for you 
 
And I step outside the door (step outside the door) 
Blinded by a million lights 
In the valley of the fools (in the valley of the fools) 
Another day went by so fast 
What in the world will ever last 
 
You must know by now 
I won't let you down 
Whatever comes along the way 
Don't you agree that one thing is true 
I'm not the best, but the best for you 
 
There's nothin' else that we have got 
But our love is like a rock 
Standing up against the tide 
 
There's nothin' else that we have got 
But our love is like a rock 
Standing up against the tide 
 
You must know by now 
I won't let you down 
Whatever comes along the way 
Don't you agree that one thing is true 
I'm not the best, but the best for you 
 
You must know by now 
I won't let you down 
Whatever comes along the way 
Don't you agree that one thing is true 
I'm not the best, but the best for you 
 
Don't you agree that one thing is true 
I'm not the best, but the best for you 
I'm not the best, but the best for you 
I'm not the best, but the best for you

CAN YOU FEEL IT

 Music: James Kottak 
Lyrics: James Kottak, Klaus Meine 
 
Can you feel it, love is waiting there 
When you feel it, I ll be waiting there 
 
Something has come over me 
I can t explain how full and free 
I want you to feel it 
Suddenly deep inside I have peace on my mind 
I want you to feel it 
 
On the last day that I walked the earth 
I found the answer to the question that we all search 
Where do we go from here 
 
Can you feel it, love is waiting there 
When you feel it, I ll be waiting there 
 
Come inside, now you are cold 
No colours block unopen doors 
I want you to feel it 
Suddenly deep inside, you have peace on your mind 
Tell me, can you feel it 
 
It s the last chance to take a look inside 
It s up to you to change the world for a better life 
Where do we go from here 
 
Can you feel it, love is waiting there 
When you feel it, I ll be waiting there 
Can you feel it, love is waiting there 
When you feel it, I ll be waiting there

My fingers walk all over you 
I won't stop before you scream 
Cause I love you 
Cause I love you 
 
I feel your body on my skin 
You're the godess of my dreams 
Cause I love you 
Cause I love you 
 
You're the sting that's in my flesh 
When I am feelin down and low 
That's why I love you 
That's why I love you 
I make you scream I make you cry 
With all my heart and soul 
That's why I love you 
That's why I love you 
 
She's the one who is crying we're flying 
She cries bitter tears when I'm blue 
She's the one who is screaming I'm dreaming 
Tonight I will reach 
Out for you...out for you 
 
Totally electric fire 
When I hold you in my arms 
Cause I love you 
Cause I love you 
 
The only true love of my life 
You're the owner of my heart 
Cause I love you 
Yes I love you 
 
She's the one who is crying we're flying 
We fly on the way to the stars 
She's the one who is screaming I'm dreaming 
When I reach you with... My guitar 
...My guitar...My guitar...

CHINA WHITE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Sometimes it seems the good times 
Never will return 
A lot has changed, babe 
'Cause evil rules the world 
 
You said you're looking for a place 
Where there's no hate 
Oh, babe, it really makes no sense 
To escape 
 
How long will it take 
To make the world a flaming star 
How long will it take 
Till they stop their senseless wars 
How long will it take 
Till everybody will understand 
That we need to fill our hearts with love again 
 
The only future we've got 
Exists right now 
Let's take the time, babe 
As long as the world is turning 'round 
 
How long will it take 
To make the earth a fireball 
How long will it take 
Till no more life exists at all 
How long will it take 
Till everybody will understand 
That we need to fill our hearts with love again 
 
It's up to you 
To fight the evil in your mind 
It's up to you 
The more love you give, the more you'll find 
The more love you give, the more you'll find 
 
Don't make the world a flaming stra 
Stop, stop all these senseless wars 
How long will it take 
Till everybody will understand 
That we need to fill our hearts with love again

Every moring when I wake up yawning 
I'm still far away 
Trucks still rolling through the early morning 
To the place we play 
Boy you'r home, you're dreaming, don't you know 
The tour's still far away 
Boy you'r home, you're dreaming, don't you know 
You're having just a break 
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like 
Coming home again 
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like 
Coming home again 
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like ... 
 
Year after year out on the road 
It's great to be here to see you all 
I know, for me it is like 
Coming home 
 
Day after day out on the road 
There's no place too far that we wouldn't go 
We go wherever you like 
To rock'n roll 
 
Jump on the seats, put your hands in the air 
Give me a shout, let me hear you're out there 
The wilder you scream for some more rock'n roll 
The higher we'll go 
 
Year after year out on the road 
It's great to be here to rock you all 
I know, for me it is like 
Coming home 
Like coming home ...

CRAZY WORLD

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker, Herman Rarebell, Jim Vallance 
 
I get up in the morning 
For my dose of the news 
Crawl right back in the sack girl 
Had enough of the truth 
Spend your dollars and rubels 
Buy a piece of the wall 
Build it up in your backyard 
I'm so sick of it all 
 
Ooh, it's a crazy world 
Ooh, it's a crazy world 
 
Drivin' down to the city 
Doin' 155 
Better late than never 
I'm more dead than alive 
We can find the Titanic 
Put a man on the moon 
But we can't fix out backyard 
Man we better start soon 
 
Ooh, it's a crazy world 
Ooh, it's a crazy world 
Ooh, it's a crazy world 
Ooh, it's a crazy world 
 
I don't want to hear about it 
I wish it would be worlds away 
You know the more I think about it 
The more I feel we need to change 
I get up (In a crazy, crazy world) 
We all live (In a crazy, crazy world) 
Ooh yeah (It's a crazy, crazy world) 
I gotta get out (Of this crazy, crazy world) 
 
Goin' home to my baby 
It's been another hard day 
Bust my balls for the tax man 
So what else can I say 
They spent our money on missiles 
For the third world war 
Now they're stacked in my backyard 
We don't need them no more 
 
Ooh, it's a crazy world 
Ooh, it's a crazy world 
Ooh, it's a crazy world 
Ooh, it's a crazy world

It seems to me a nightmare becomes reality 
The last days of the paradise are gone for you and me 
We're living in the crossfire 
And we'll be killed at first 
Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world 
Understand that we don't wanna fight 
Understand that we are mush too young to die 
Understand no one will survive 
Understand that we love our life 
 
Can I trust the meaning of the life line in my hand 
Which is as long as exciting hundred years 
I could be a lucky man 
But I'm living in the crossfire 
Of a time that starts to burn 
Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world 
Understand that we don't wanna fight 
Understand that we are mush too young to die 
Understand no one will survive 
Understand that we love our life

CRYING DAYS

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Force yourself to use your brain, 
The only way to gain, 
A lot of things are just a lie. 
This world we love comes down in pain 
With hate and bloody games 
A question mark up in the sky. 
 
Look, you can't keep away 
And you can't hide 
Tomorrow, yesterday, today ... 
 
Some people say, we'll do it better 
Some people say, everything's good 
Some people sing, let's come together 
But nobody has ever brought it through 
Maybe you and me ...

You're too young to realize 
What he wants from you tonight 
 
Poor little girl 
There is no one 
You can trust in the world 
In the darkness of the night 
What he's doing is a crime

There's a problem 
She's looking away 
She don't wanna hear you cry 
She will pray 
Then it's over for a while 
 
Sweet little child 
You know nothing 
But a cold world outside 
You're too young to realize 
What he wants from you tonight

There's a problem 
She's looking away 
She don't wanna hear you cry 
She will pray 
Then it's over for a while 
 
An ocean of silence 
Is drowning your heart 
What never should be 
Will remain in the dark 
 
Poor little girl 
There is no one 
You can trust in the world

You're feeling high and low, but you don't know what to think 
The world is full of saints who live their lives in sin 
 
Don't ask the mirror ball you better ask yourself 
I think you know the answers but maybe you can't tell 
You'll see it all so clear just take a look inside 
The judge you build inside your heart will always be your guide 
 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
 
Another day goes by and so does your life 
You try to make some sense before your time to die 
If you feel humility for something that is true 
You'll find the secrets of this life deep inside of you 
 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
The innocent won't feel the judgement day 
 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
The innocent won't feel the judgement day 
 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
Mon destin inscrit en toi 
The innocent won't feel the judgement day

DOES ANYONE KNOW

 Music: Klaus Meine 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Is this world out of control 
Say what is right what is wrong 
Do I know this world at all 
I think I do but then I don't 
I'm confused by what I see 
I try to understand 
But it makes no sense at all 
I'm confused by what I feel 
I thought that our love 
Was something that is real 
 
Does anyone know 
The truth we're looking for 
Can't find it anymore 
Does anyone know 
How to make me feel 
For something that is real 
 
So many things that I recall 
When we were young just flying high 
Can we turn our fate at all 
I wish we could say don't you cry 
I'm confused by what I hear 
Girl it seems to me 
We're losing after all 
I'm confused by what I feel 
I thought that our love 
Was something that is real 
 
Does anyone know 
The truth we're looking for 
Can't find it anymore 
Does anyone know 
How to make me feel 
For something that is real 
 
Another day has just begun 
Life goes on there's no return 
How can I trust anyone 
When honesty is such a dirty word 
 
Does anyone know 
The truth we're looking for 
Can't find it anymore 
Does anyone know 
How to make me feel 
For something that is real 
 
Does anyone know 
The truth we're looking for 
Can't find it anymore 
Does anyone know 
How to make me feel 
For something that is real 
 
Yeah

DON'T BELIEVE HER

 Music: Rudolf Schenker, Jim Vallance 
Lyrics: Herman Rarebell, Klaus Meine, Jim Vallance 
 
Out for a thrill 
Got time to kill 
Just livin' up my dreams 
for heaven's sake 
She's on the make 
A twisted vicar's queen 
And then one night we took a ride 
She was all over me 
Outrageous 
Just ain't real 
I was too wasted to see 
 
Before you get in too deep 
And you get burned by the heat 
Oh yeah 
She'll take you there 
You know it happened to me 
 
She'll make your heart break 
She'll give you fever 
She'll tell you everything but don't believe her 
A perfect stranger 
She knows the game 
She'll promise heaven on earth 
But don't believe her 
 
Out on the street of broken dreams 
Where no one ever wins 
Just when you thought you'd made a start 
You're back where you begin 
 
Before you get in too deep 
And you get burned by the heat 
Oh yeah 
She'll take you there 
I think you know what I mean 
 
She'll make you crazy 
She's such a teaser 
Says you're the only one but don't believe her 
She deals in danger 
The girl's insane 
She'll promise heaven on earth 
But don't believe her 
 
Before you get in too deep 
And you get burned by the heat 
Oh yeah 
She'll take you there 
You know it happened to me 
 
Don't believe her (Don't believe her) 
Don't believe her (Don't believe her) 
Don't believe her (Don't believe her) 
I can't believe her (Don't believe her) 
 
She'll make your heart break 
She'll give you fever 
She'll tell you everything but don't believe her 
A perfect stranger 
She knows the game 
She'll promise heaven on earth 
 
She'll make you crazy 
She's such a teaser 
Says you're the only one but don't believe her 
She deals in danger 
The girl's insane 
She'll promise heaven on earth 
But don't believe her 
 
Don't believe her 
Don't believe her 
Don't believe her 
Don't believe her

DON'T MAKE NO PROMISES

 Music: Matthias Jabs 
Lyrics: Herman Rarebell 
 
I saw this girl walking down the street 
I thought, oh yeah, she looks rather neat 
I grabbed my chance and played my usual game 
I tell you man, it can be a strain 
 
She didn't wanna know what I'd got to say 
Just shook her head and looked the other way 
And then she said, I've met your type before 
For me you're all the same, you're such a bore 
 
Oh no, don't make no promises 
Oh no, your body can't keep 
 
Next day, can you believe, she was at the show 
She said, hey man, you're great and she took me home 
She started to undress, what a shock to see 
Padded bra, blonde wig, not much left for me 
 
Oh no, don't make no promises 
Oh no, your body can't keep 
 
Oh no, don't make no promises 
Oh no, your body can't keep 
 
Oh no, don't make no promises 
Oh no, your body can't keep 
 
Oh no, don't make no promises 
Oh no, your body can't keep

DON'T STOP AT THE TOP

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell 
 
You never take the easy way 
The wind is blowing straight into your face 
You never ever close your eyes 
For any trouble that may cross your way 
There's no risk that you're not taking 
Not a mountain that's too high 
Spread your wings, You're gonna make it 
To the best time of your life 
 
Don't stop at the top 
Touch the sky before you drop 
 
You never make a compromise 
Your will has got the power that won't break 
You never say never to a challenge 
That will come along the way 
There's no risk that you're not taking 
Not a mountain that's too high 
Spread your wings, you're gonna make it 
To the best time of your life 
 
Don't stop at the top 
Touch the sky before you drop 
 
Never stop! Don't stop at the top

DRIFTING SUN

 Music: Ulrich Roth 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
Well, sitting on a stone, 
Sitting all alone, 
Sticky things are rolling down the mountain. 
Well, see the lonesome tramp 
Who's living in the damp 
Nobody's in the valley 
 
Shine on, shine on, Sun oh it's so cold right here 
Shine on, shine on, Sun shine on all night long 
 
Daydreams are of silent blue 
Icy wings will carry you. 
Midnight Sun will never shine 
Just ravings of a fool you think 
And laugh about him all the time. 
 
Shine on, shine on, Sun oh it's so cold right here 
Shine on, shine on, Sun shine on all night long 
 
White pale velvet Autumn Sun will fade away 
Forgotten Life will finish now in endless grey. 
Some days are drifting haze 
Some days are glowing blaze 
Some days are tides of life... 
 
Staggerin' along a tropic highway 
Crazy lights are whirling 'round and 'round 
Hell or heaven Night or Day? 
Burning fingers push the Sun away... 
 
Shine on, shine on, Sun...

Who's gonna tell you when, it's too late 
Who's gonna tell you things, aren't so great 
 
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong 
Who's gonna drive you home tonight 
 
Who's gonna pick you up, when you fall 
Who's gonna hang it up, when you call 
Who's gonna pay attention, to your dreams 
Who's gonna plug your ears, when you scream 
 
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong 
Who's gonna drive you home tonight 
 
Who's gonna hold you down, when you escape 
Who's gonna come around, when you break 
 
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong 
Who's gonna drive you home tonight 
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong 
Who's gonna drive you home tonight 
 
Who's gonna drive you home tonight

Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Matthias Jabs, James Kottak 
 
Der Atem kalt wie Eis 
Obwohl die Erde brennt 
Wo du auch bist, da werd' ich sein 
Ich lebe jetzt, ich lebe hier in dieser Welt 
Ich atme durch voller Gier 
Damn you slam you, eat me like a menue 
Take it brake it, kick it to the ground 
Empty hollow, it's so hard to swallow 
Gotta know what's your size 
Du bist so schmutzig, und doch so sch n 
Ich will mich in dir verlier'n 
Du bist so schmutzig, wie weit willst Du geh'n 
Nur um mich zu am sier'n 
Du bringst mich noch einmal um den Verstand 
Niemand hat Dich je gesehen 
Doch ich folge nur Deiner Spur 
Durch Fleisch und Blut 
Denn Du, Du lebst in mir 
Ammo slammo, it's gotta go blammo 
Lust you bust, Can I ever trust you 
Scare you dare you, anyway I want you 
Catch you grab you now 
Du bist so schmutzig, und doch so sch n 
Ich will mich in dir verlier'n 
Du bist so schmutzig, wie weit willst Du geh'n 
Nur um mich zu am sier'n 
Hard ass lard ass, keep your hands of my stash 
Holy stoli gotta have a stogie 
Master blaster, buy a jabocaster 
Gotta eat your heart out now 
Du bist so schmutzig, und doch so sch n 
Oh du meine Phantasie 
Du bist so schmutzig, wie weit willst Du geh'n 
Bleib mir treu, verlass mich nie 
Du bist so schmutzig, und doch so sch n 
Ich will mich in dir verlier'n

DUST IN THE WIND

 Music: Kerry Livgren 
Lyrics: Kerry Livgren 
 
I close my eyes 
Only for a moment and the moment's gone 
All my dreams 
Pass before my eyes, a curiosity 
 
Dust in the wind 
All they are is dust in the wind 
 
Same old song 
Just a drop of water in an endless sea 
All we do 
Crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see 
 
Dust in the wind 
All we are is dust in the wind 
 
Now, Don't hang on 
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky 
It slips away 
And all your money won't another minute buy 
 
Dust in the wind 
All we are is dust in the wind 
Dust in the wind 
All we are is dust in the wind 
Dust in the wind 
All we are is dust in the wind 
Dust in the wind 
All we are is dust in the wind

EDGE OF TIME

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Only the Lord knows the answer 
To the mess this world is in 
At the end of the rainbow 
We're scared to death once again 
 
Life's getting shorter every hour 
It keeps on feeding in my face 
Why can't we stop the evil power 
That will kill the human race 
 
Right, baby don't cry 
Keep on dancing tonight 
On the edge of time 
 
Right, baby don't cry 
Keep on dancing tonight 
On the edge of time 
 
Only the Lord knows the answer 
To the mess this world is in 
This place has turned into Atlantis 
And it's already started to sink 
 
Life in the fast lane 
Has turned into a dead end street 
Let's turn the wheel back to the future 
Let's use the power of our dreams 
 
Right, baby don't cry 
Keep on dancing tonight 
On the edge of time 
 
Right, baby don't cry 
Keep on dancing tonight 
On the edge of time 
 
Right, baby don't cry 
Keep on dancing tonight 
On the edge of time 
 
Right, baby don't cry 
Keep on dancing tonight 
On the edge of time

EVENING WIND

 Music: Ulrich Roth 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
Summerday is gone 
Listen to the evening wind 
Singing tunes of tamarind 
Into the setting Sun... 
You lie in twilight sleep 
Dreaming colours deep 
Today all life is gone! 
 
Look at the golden chalice 
Plight broken on the ground 
Green fire blazin' 'round 
Where are your friends? 
You see all hope 
Lying broken on the slope 
Today all life is gone!

EVERY MINUTE EVERY DAY

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Well it seems that I was lost 
In intoxicated nights 
Following the trace of ecstasy 
With no future and no past 
Just the present was alive 
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream 
 
I was drowning in a feeling 
That obsession rules 
'till the morning kills the creatures of the night 
And I read your lipstick message 
On the mirror of the truth 
Now that you're gone I realize 
Without you 
Life's like a song without music 
Without you 
This world won't be the same 
 
I need your love, every minute 
I need your love, every day 
I need your love, every minute 
I need your love, come back and stay 
 
Well I know that I was lost 
In the nightmare of my life 
Following the flash of fantasy 
In a feeling that exploded 
I'd left reality behind 
Addicted to the power of a dream 
Without you 
Life's like that road that leads nowhere 
Without you 
The world won't feel the same 
 
I need your love, every minute 
I need your love, every day 
I need your love, every minute 
I need your love, come back and stay

EYE TO EYE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
A live begins another's over 
As another day begins 
Life runs full circle getting older 
It happens to me 
It happens to you 
I do believe you're still around me 
You're still around me all the time 
I have no doubt one day in heaven 
I will see you again 
I'll see you again, see you again 
Break the bread drink the wine 
In my heart you'll live forever 
The time to go is never right 
When we say goodbye 
While we're here we shouldn't waste 
A day in life to say I love you 
It's now that I'd just wish so much, to see you 
Eye to eye 
When you came home the war was over 
So many years before my time 
I was so proud the day you told me 
You havn't hurt anyone 
No one 
Break the bread drink the wine 
In my heart you'll live forever 
The time to go is never right 
When we say goodbye 
While we're here we shouldn't waste 
A day in life to say I love you 
It's now that I'd just wish so much to see you 
Eye to eye

I look in your eyes, I really think you're fooling me 
You're pretty and nice, it doesn't matter don't you see

And I'm falling in love, it happens to me every day

FAR AWAY

 Music: Rudolf Schenker, Michael Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Take your hand and you take my hand 
Let's try to learn to fly 
Here what I say, here what I say 
Dream and close your eyes 
 
Too much hate 
Too much hate 
So many things are wrong 
So many ways, so many ways 
Flying through the sky forever 
into another time 
 
Yesterday so far away 
Many miles together 
Were looking for a way 
 
Day by day 
So far away 
All the world 
To do the same 
 
So we go together 
Will you show me the way 
Time has gone 
It has gone 
 
Far away, far away 
 
And today 
I'll see a way 
Follow me we love you 
Just listen, what I say 
 
Forget your name and yesterday 
Put out your hand 
I'll do the same 
 
Now were going to another land 
Will you show me the way 
Time has gone 
It has gone far away 
Far away

When you look into space 
He's so bright and he is so great 
Come on or it's too late 
 
All together

Fly to the rainbow 
Fly people fly

See the rainbow in the sun 
The man will not go 
And the world they have no fun 
Hurry up people run

Fly people fly

FLY TO THE RAINBOW

 Music: Michael Schenker 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
Life is empty, can't remember anytime before, 
On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore, 
Gliding through this life, and another is a child, 
and we're doing games, and losing things, 
Always playing gigs. 
Somewhere in the sky, where the moon the stars shine bright, 
Where the sun is shining, in the night. 
I am in disgrace, yet i see a smiling face, 
and i hope you let me, share your place. 
I don't live today. 
 
Rain in the sky , make the world fly, 
Into time, beg me your time. 
Sun in the sky, make the world fly, 
Into time, beg me your time. 
 
Rain in the sky , make the world fly, 
Into time, beg me your time. 
Sun in the sky, make the world fly, 
Into time, beg me your time. 
 
Rain in the sky , make the world fly, 
Into time, beg me your time. 
Sun in the sky, make the world fly, 
Into time, beg me your time. 
 
Well, I lived in magic solitude 
Of cloudy looking mountains 
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops ... 
Roaming through Space tenthousand years ago 
I've seen the giant city of Atlantis 
Sinking to eternal waves of darkness ... 
 
Somewhere in the blue distance 
Are those long forgotten trees of yore 
A broken violin floating alone in December 
Darkness everywhere and nothing more. 
 
Symbol strange Symbol Melancholy 
Painting torrid colors to a sky of green 
Candle breathing one night only 
Far away in chillness bleak unseen ... 
 
Drifting galley ghostlike shadow, 
Sails rigged to catch and kill the Time... 
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow 
To call the Thing ... Sublime !...

Faraway children bleed, God save them. 
Drifting garish ghosts like shadows. 
Save break to catch and kill time. 
Echoes one round endless meadow.

FRESHLY SQUEEZED

 Music: Rudolf Schenker, Peter Wolf 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
A G string is looking for a pilot 
White flesh is coming down the stairs again 
Your look just makes me a believer 
Stray cats are landing in a rain storm 
Crashed down lost in wango tango land 
Spaced out your body gives me fever 
You sex it 
Relax it 
Reload it 
You want it freshly squeezed 
Closed down the road of all restrictions 
Mad dogs are tearing down the roof again 
Sweet noise is pouring from the speakers 
Last dance I'm drowning in the moonlight 
Exit is the door that I can't find 
Black out it can't get it any deeper 
You sex it 
Relax it 
Reload it 
And never hold it 
You slash it 
Refresh it 
Reload it 
You want it fresh 
Got no diamonds rings 
But a song to sing 
Just to make you fly 
Beggar or a king

HATE TO BE NICE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Hey baby, listen up 
I'm not in love with you 
You keep runnin' off at the mouth 
And someone else can scratch my back 
And I could care less about your legs 
I just wanna see 'em walk all over me 
 
I'm runnin' out of patience 
And I ain't gonna say it twice 
The world out there is down'n dirty, honey 
And I just hate to be nice 
 
So don't think about movin' any closer, baby 
Just forget about it 
You body may be a weapon on legs 
But hey, I'm not fallin' for that 
Don't you get it, I'm not impressed at all 
I just wanna see you crawl all over me 
 
I'm runnin' out of patience 
And I ain't gonna say it twice 
The world out there is down'n dirty, honey 
And I just hate to be nice 
 
Don't you understand 
Don't you understand 
 
Tell me when your eyes say yes 
How can your lips say no 
A girl like you shouldn't be surprised 
It's just I hate to be nice 
 
I'm runnin' out of patience 
And I ain't gonna say it twice 
The world out there is down'n dirty, honey 
And I just hate to be nice

HE'S A WOMAN SHE'S A MAN

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell 
 
I saw it walkin' lonely down the street 
Cool like a cat, like crazy clean 
I looked twice again, I can't believe 
Oh no no no 
It turned around right then 
And looked at me 
I said oh no, it really couldn't be 
It was a man, it was a woman, too 
 
He's a woman, she's a man 
He's a woman, she's a (woman) 
 
I think it really came from far away 
I'm feeling head uptight so I have to stay 
It takes my hand and says come on, let's go 
Let's go, let's go, let's go 
We're goin' home, it's nice and warm to say 
He starts to move, she starts to play 
I need a body, why not you 
 
He's a woman, she's a man 
He's a woman, she's a (woman) 
 
He's a woman, she's a man 
He's a woman, she's a (woman)

I'm feeling hypnotised, I have to stay

HELL CAT

 Music: Ulrich Roth 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
Fire in her eyes ... burn ... 
Perfume of the skies ... 
Fingers cold as ice ... freeze ... 
Devil in disguise! 
 
Well, she's a, she's a, she's a 
You know that she's a hell cat, hell cat, hell cat, hell cat 
(She's gonna scratch up your mind ...) 
You know that guy with piccadilly eyes 
Was talking to the French boy 
But didn't realize. 
Banana long boat eating 
An' he tried to get a wife 
But he couldn't stay alive 
Well, you know that lad with the rubber dad 
Paints his fingers yellow, blue, and red. 
An' you also know that she's a liar 
Knowing only her desire ...

HERE IN MY HEART

 Music & Lyrics: Diane Warren 
 
Sometimes there s a time you must say goodbye 
Though it hurts you must learn to try 
I know I ve got to let you go 
But I know anywhere you go 
You ll never be far 
 Coz like the light of a bright star 
You ll keep shining in my life 
You re gonna be right 
 
Here in my heart 
That s where you ll be 
You ll be with me 
Here in my heart 
No distance can keep us apart 
Long as you re here in my heart 
 
Won t be any tears falling from these eyes 
 Coz when love s true love never dies 
It stays alive forever 
Time can t take away what we have 
I will remember our time together 
You might think our time is through 
But I still have you 
 
Here in my heart 
That s where you ll be 
You ll be with me 
Here in my heart 
No distance can keep us apart 
Long as you re here in my heart 
 
I know you ll be back again 
And till then 
My love is waiting 
 
Here in my heart 
That s where you ll be 
You ll be with me 
Here in my heart 
No distance can keep us apart 
Long as you re here in my heart

HEROES DON'T CRY

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Heroes don't cry 
Heroes don't cry 
 
Standing here in front of you 
A wave of joy and sadness fills the room 
Your soul has crashed into a wall 
Your world just broke to pieces after all 
 
The days of your life 
Leave the world standing outside 
But you find the strength for a smile 
Because heroes like you wouldn't cry 
 
Heroes don't cry 
Heroes don't cry 
 
The judge decided it's your right 
To wake up from the dream of your life 
The curtain is about to fall 
No need for words, your eyes just say it all 
 
The days of your life 
Leave the world standing outside 
You find the strength for a smile 
Because heroes like you wouldn't cry 
 
Heroes don't cry 
 
There are days of your life 
Leave the world standing outside 
You find the strength for a smile 
Because heroes like you wouldn't cry 
 
Heroes don't cry 
 
I can't forget that afternoon 
 
So many times I've been thinking of you 
I'm happy that you've decided to live 
And what touches me most is what you said 
Heaven can wait, can wait, can wait...

Hey you, I'm in love with your eyes 
And the sound of your name 
Hey you, I'm in love with your smile 
And the way you're dressed today 
 
Hey you, well I like the way you walk 
Just like a star moves on stage 
Hey you, well I like the way you talk 
You're really calm for your age 
 
I really die 
You're driving me wild 
I really die 
I'm in love 100 times 
 
I really die 
You're driving me wild 
I really die 
I'm in love 100 times 
To be your answer 
 
Hey you, I said you know what's going on 
Do you know what I mean 
Hey you, if he wants you better come 
This school is up to me 
 
I really die 
You're driving me wild 
I really die 
I'm in love 100 times 
 
I really die 
You're driving me wild 
I really die 
I'm in love 100 times 
To be your answer

HIS LATEST FLAME

 Music: Doc Pomus 
Lyrics: Mort Shuman 
 
A very old friend 
Came by today 
'Cause he was telling everyone in town 
About the love he just found 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame 
 
He talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest, blackest hair 
The prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame 
 
Though I smiled the tears inside were a burning 
I wish him luck, and then he said goodbye 
He was gone, but still his words kept returning 
What else was there for me to do but cry 
 
Would you believe that yesterday 
This girl was in my arms and sworn to me 
She'd be mine eternally 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame 
 
Though I smiled the tears inside were a burning 
I wish him luck, and then he said goodbye 
He was gone, but still his words kept returning 
What else was there for me to do but cry 
 
Would you believe that yesterday 
This girl was in my arms and sworn to me 
She'd be mine eternally 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame 
 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame 
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

HIT BETWEEN THE EYES

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Herman Rarebell, Klaus Meine, Jim Vallance 
 
Late at night when you're all alone 
Take a ride to the danger zone 
If someone wants to cut you down to size 
You never argue with a loaded .45 
 
Just when you've had enough 
It's really getting tough 
 
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes 
Someone get me out of here alive 
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes 
Can't you see I'm much too young to die 
 
You can feel the tension in the street 
There's no escape, getting closer to the heat 
You play with fire, get your fingers burned 
It's too late, past the point of no return 
 
Just when you've had enough 
It's really getting tough 
 
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes 
Someone get me out of here alive 
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes 
Can't you see I'm much too young to die 
 
Late at night when you're all alone 
Take a ride to the danger zone 
If someone wants to cut you down to size 
You never argue with a loaded .45 
 
Just when you've had enough 
It's really getting tough 
 
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes 
Someone get me out of here alive 
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes 
Can't you see I'm much too young to die

Can't you see I'm much too young to die

HOLD ME TIGHT

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell 
 
She's the one, that's what I thought 
When our love had just begun 
But times have changed 
And I's better go 
Because it's gonna be too late 
And all my love will turn to hate 
You've always known 
That music is my life 
And I live just for Rock'n Roll 
No one can make me change my mind 
'cause I just want to live my life 
 
Alright don't want me to stay 
Alright have it your way 
Alright I'm leaving tonight 
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight 
 
You're still the one 
But you've shown me 
How independent you've become 
Don't tell me you need, you need me 
To be your ever faithful strong lovin' man 
Don't tell me I'm wrong 
I gotta go my way 
And you'll see, where I belong 
You live your life and I live mine 
I bet, you will turn out fine 
 
Alright don't want me to stay 
Alright have it your way 
Alright I'm leaving tonight 
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight 
 
Alright don't want me to stay 
Alright have it your way 
Alright I'm leaving tonight 
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight 
 
Alright don't want me to stay 
Alright have it your way 
Alright I'm leaving tonight 
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight

Longing for the sun be welcome 
On the island many miles away from home 
Be welcome on the island without name 
Longing for the sun you will come

HURRICANE 2000

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell 
 
It's early morning 
The sun comes out 
Last night was shaking 
And pretty loud 
My cat is purring 
And scratches my skin 
So what is wrong 
With another sin 
The bitch is hungry 
She needs to tell 
So give her inches 
And feed her well 
More days to come 
New places to go 
I've got to leave 
It's time for a show 
 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
 
My body is burning 
It starts to shout 
Desire is coming 
It breaks out loud 
Lust is in cages 
Till storm breaks loose 
Just have to make it 
With someone I choose 
The night is calling 
I have to go 
The wolf is hungry 
He runs the show 
He's licking his lips 
He's ready to win 
On the hunt tonight 
For love at first sting 
 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

I CAN'T EXPLAIN

 Music :Pete Townshend 
Lyrics:Pete Townshend 
 
I got a feeling inside 
It's a certain kind 
I feel hot and cold 
Deep down in my soul 
 
I said I can't explain 
I'm feeling good enough baby 
 
I'm dizzy in my head 
And I'm feeling blue 
Things you say but maybe they're true 
Getting funny dreams again and again 
I know what it means but 
 
I can't explain 
I think it's love 
I'm trying to say to you 
When I feel blue 
But I can't explain (can't explain) 
Just hear what I'm saying baby (can't explain) 
 
I'm dizzy in the head 
And I'm feeling bad 
Things you say got me real mad 
Getting funny dreams again and again 
I know what it means but 
 
I can't explain 
I think it's love 
I'm trying to say to you 
When I feel blue 
But I can't explain (can't explain) 
Just hear me one more time baby (can't explain) 
 
I'm dizzy in the head 
And I'm feeling bad 
Things you say got me real mad 
Getting funny dreams again and again 
I know what it means but 
 
I can't explain 
I think it's love 
I'm trying to say to you 
When I feel blue 
But I can't explain (can't explain) 
Just hear me one more time baby (can't explain) 
 
She drive me out of my mind (can't explain) 
She drive me out of my mind (can't explain) 
She drive me out of my mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mind (can't explain) 
She drive me out of my mind (can't explain) 
You drive me out of my mind (can't explain) 
 
Oooh yeah, I can't explain

I WANTED TO CRY (BUT THE TEARS WOULDN'T COME)

 Music: Klaus Meine 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Well here comes my baby 
She's dressed oh so cute 
She looks a little crazy 
In her Hollywood shoes 
Well baby loves driving 
In my hot brand new car 
She thinks less than flying 
Is not fast enough 
 
But when you turn upside down 
Life ain't too much fun 
I wanted to cry 
But the tears wouldn't come 
 
Here comes my baby 
She's the one I adore 
Well she's a lucky lady 
Born in a Gucci store 
With gold cards in motion 
And the platinum too 
She jets across the ocean 
A little faster than you 
 
But when it rains in St. Barth 
Life ain't too much fun 
I wanted to cry 
But the tears wouldn't come 
I wanted to cry 
But the tears wouldn't come 
 
Every night without you 
I miss to have you by my side 
Ohh, so I keep waiting, I keep waiting 
I swear I never let you go again 
 
Well here comes my baby 
With a Brad Pitt lookalike 
Right through immigration 
And straight out of my life 
 
Well it seems the friendly skies 
Are pretty good fun 
I wanted to cry 
But the tears wouldn't come 
 
I wanted to cry 
I wanted to cry 
I wanted to cry 
But the tears wouldn't come

Walking through the desert 
You know what it's about 
It's really from the church 
Too foreign 
That was never there 
Yet you know I'm in heaven 
But it is a hell 
Sun is drying up my brain 
The smile and installations 
Are my pain 
I'm going mad 
I'm going mad 
I'm going mad 
Aaaayowwww!!! 
 
Walking through the desert 
You know what it's about

Are my pain 
I'm goin' mad!

 Music: Ulrich Roth 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
You're burning my heart 
 you're burning my mind 
you're spoiling my art 
 you're wasting my time 
 
No taste in your actions 
no taste in your line 
 no truth or direction 
 no true love of mine 
 
You say you wanna be a superstar 
don't give a damn how to get that far 
you say you wanna ride a diamond car 
but I don't like your fat cigar. 
 
Hey, hey, hey don't you wanna see 
I'm not your stepping stone 
hey, hey, hey I've got to be free 
so leave my life alone 
 
You're in love with success 
you're spilling my wine 
don't follow my tracks, babe 
you ways are not mine 
 
Your main god is money 
you're wasting my life 
I'm not your Bugs Bunny 
and you're not my wife 
 
You say you only do it for our best 
but you don't wanna see what I detest 
you think me crack brained 
that I'm gonna leave your show 
but you can't see what I see 
so let me go.

IN SEARCH OF THE PEACE OF MIND

 Music: Michael Schenker, Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Wolfgang Dziony, Lothar Heimberg 
 
When I'm alone I'm feeling blue 
Dreaming a dream of a world that's lovely and true 
 
Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world 
And no one will care as long as the world will turn 
 
Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world 
And no one will care as long as the world will turn 
 
And I know a place to go to find my peace of mind 
And I know a place to find my peace of mind 
 
And I try

SCORPIONS
IN SEARCH OF THE PEACE OF MIND

 Music: Michael Schenker, Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Wolfgang Dziony, Lothar Heimberg 
 
When I'm alone 
I'm feeling blue 
Dreaming a dream 
Of a world that's not free and true 
 
Faintly the dream of a true and 
Wonderful world 
And no one would care 
As long as the world will turn 
 
Faintly the dream of a true and 
Wonderful world 
And no one would care 
As long as the world will turn 
 
And I know a place to go 
To find my peace of mind 
And I know a place to find 
My peace of mind 
 
And I try 
And I try 
And I try 
And I try

IN TRANCE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I wake up in the morning 
and the sun begins to shine 
the day did sneak up on the night 
I see your face and I see myself 
and I get a little taste of life 
I try to stand it for a while 
 
But I'm in a trance 
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling 
I'm in a trance 
I take too much in the Saturday night 
Hey... Hey 
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling 
I'm in a trance 
I wanna try to stop this life 
 
I feel so sad I'm feeling down 
On the radio the music plays 
I'm in love with her and I feel fine 
I close my eyes 
I think today is getting better with a sip of wine 
and I can stand it for a while 
 
When I'm in a trance 
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling 
I'm in a trance 
I take too much in the Saturday night 
Hey... Hey 
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling

IN YOUR PARK

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
In the night there is 
A gentle voice of silence 
So low and quiet 
She'll catch me 'cos I've been longing. 
 
I want to walk in your park 
Cos I'm alone, 
I want to walk in your heart 
Where are you? I don't know ... 
 
I look around and see 
The sunshine in the morning. 
(Shadows in the night 
Like angels by your side in the alley ...) 
 
On my journey I change the time, 
Leave everything behind me. 
(Shadows in the night 
Like angels by your side in the alley ...) 
 
I want to walk in your park 
Cos I'm alone, 
I want to walk in your heart 
Where are you? I don't know ... 
 
Let me walk, let me walk in your heart!

Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Wolfgang Dziony, Lothar Heimberg 
 
Test the mend, devil melt 
Bloody money when it's lent 
Scum repair everywhere 
They want money, oh 
 
Heavenly won't it be 
Here's some money 
Belong to thee 
I will pay they will say 
Give your money, oh 
 
Obligator came and said to me 
Why don't you pay your debt 
The debt that you amend 
Asking him forgive on his demand 
For I am with a mate 
Despite in her return 
Remittance of the debt 
I can't accept 
He told me and he capped 
Quite time on his demand 
 
Imaginations came into my brain 
Cause if you patients came 
That brings me in my break 
 
Test the mend, devil mend 
Bloody money when it's lent 
Scum repair everywhere 
They want money, oh

IS THERE ANYBODY THERE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell 
 
Open my mind let me find new vibrations 
Tell me the way I must take to reach my destination 
And a place where I can stay 
Where is the love of my life couldn't find her 
Show me the way to find myself 
'Cause I'm nowhere in the darkness of these days 
 
Is there anybody there who feels that vibration 
Who whows me the way to my love 
Is there anybody there with that inclination 
To bring back to sun to my heart 
 
I find myself in a state of confusion 
Life's like a pantomime trick or a laser illusion 
Where's a place that I can stay 
Save me don't let me get lost in the ocean 
I need your help everyday to control my emotions 
In the darkness of these days 
 
Is there anybody there who feels that vibration 
Who shows me the way to my love 
Is there anybody there with that inclination 
To bring back the sun to my heart

She's my love 
She's my dear 
Love is here 
I was there 
 
Ahhh! 
Yeah!

KICKS AFTER SIX

 Music: Francis Buchholz, Jim Vallance 
Lyrics: Herman Rarebell, Klaus Meine, Jim Vallance 
 
Another morning, such as ordinary day 
She's doin' time from nine to five 
The hours waste away 
There's no escape, She's a part of the bog machine 
She's a slave to the suit and tie 
Seven days a week 
 
But every night 
She can hardly wait 
It feels alright 
To give it all away 
 
Good girls get their kicks after six 
Good girls get their kicks after six 
(She needs it bad, real real bad) 
She wants what she never had 
All the things that make a good girl bad 
She gets her kicks after six 
 
Some days its hard to face the cruel reality 
Just waitin' for the bell to ring 
She wants to be free 
It feels so good to start another endless night 
She spreads her wings for another flight 
She's running wild 
 
But every night 
She can hardly wait 
It feels alright 
To give it all away 
 
Good girls get their kicks after six 
(She needs it bad, real real bad) 
Good girls get their kicks after six 
(Ooh yeah shake it for me baby) 
She wants what she never had 
All the things that make a good girl bad 
She gets her kicks after six 
 
Good girls get their kicks after six 
(She needs it bad, real real bad) 
Good girls get their kicks after six 
(Ooh yeah nothin's gonna stop her) 
She wants what she never had 
All the things that make a good girl bad 
She gets her kicks after six 
 
Good girls get their kicks after six 
(She needs it bad, real real bad) 
Good girls get their kicks after six 
(C'mon baby take it to the limit) 
She wants what she never had 
All the things that make a good girl bad 
She gets her kicks after six

LADY STARLIGHT

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Walking through a winter night, 
Counting the stars 
And passing time 
I dream about the summer days, 
Love in the sun 
And lonely bays 
 
I see the stars, they're miles and miles away 
Like our love, 
On one of these lonely winter nights 
 
Dreaming through a winter night, 
Memories of you 
On My Mind 
It seems to me like yesterday 
I think you knew I couldn't stay 
 
I see the stars, they're miles and miles away 
Like our love 
Lady starlight, help me to find my love 
Lady starlight, help me tonight 
Help me to find my love 
 
Walking through a winter night, 
Counting the stars 
And passing time 
Snow dances with the wind 
Keep thinking of you again and again 
 
I see the stars, they're miles and miles away 
Like our love 
Lady starlight, help me to find my love 
Lady starlight, help me tonight 
Help me to find my love

LIFE IS TOO SHORT

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker 
 
Have you ever seen the morning 
When the sun comes up the shore 
And the silence makes 
A beautiful sound 
Have you ever sat there waiting 
For the time to stand still 
For all the world to stop 
From turning around 
 
And you run 
'Cause life is too short 
And you run 
'Cause life is too short 
 
Have you ever seen the glowing 
When the moon is on the rise 
And the dreams are close 
To the ones that we love 
Have you ever sat there waiting 
For heaven to give a sign 
So we could find the place 
Where angels come from 
 
And you run 
'Cause life is too short 
And you run 
'Cause life is too short 
And you run 
'Cause life is too short 
And you run 
'Cause life is too short 
 
There's a time that turns 
I'd turn back time 
But I don't say I can 
It only works if you believe in the truth 
Well there's a time to live 
And a time to cry 
But if you're by my side 
I will try to catch a star 
I'll try to catch a star 
Just for you 
 
And I run 
'Cause life is too short 
And I run 
'Cause life is too short 
And I run 
'Cause life is too short 
And I run 
'Cause life is too short 
 
Too short 
Too short 
Life is too short 
 
Too short 
Too short 
Life is too short

LIFE'S LIKE A RIVER

 Music: Ulrich Roth, Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Corinna Fortmann 
 
As years are passing by 
Silence becomes your friend 
You see the world in a different way 
Don't be afraid of getting old 
Life's still full of joy 
And the beauty of the past 
Is rejoicing your mind. 
 
When days are getting short 
And winter comes along 
Your Life slows down and down 
Life's like a river getting wide 
The words have lost their force 
You remember your morning 
Flow into the endless sea. 
 
Life's like a river in the morning 
Life's like a sea without end 
Life's like a river in the morning 
Life's like a sea without end

LIVING AND DYING

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
In the dirty old city 
There is my home 
There's my home, there's my home 
There is my home 
 
Nothing really looks pretty 
And I've been alone 
I've been alone, I've been alone 
I've been alone 
 
And in my heart 
Many wishes are crying 
Living and dying 
 
And in my heart 
Many wishes are crying 
Living and dying 
 
In the house of darkness 
There's a magic stone 
Magic stone, magic stone 
The magic stone 
 
But I couldn't find it 
'Cause the shine is gone 
Shine is gone, shine is gone 
The shine is gone 
 
And in my heart 
Many wishes are crying 
Living and dying 
 
And in my heart 
Many wishes are crying 
Living and dying 
 
Living and dying 
Living and dying

LIVING FOR TOMORROW

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I'm still living for tomorrow 
I'm living for today 
 
Let's make this world 
A better place to live 
Start to take 
Start to give 
 
Love's got the power 
To get it done 
To stop the pain 
Of a killing gun 
 
And even if you say 
We're gonna die today 
I'm still living for tomorrow 
I'm living for today 
Cause love will find a way my friend 
Whatever it will take 
I'm still living for tomorrow 
I'm living for today 
Why don't we try today my friend 
To make this world a better place 
 
Let's make this life 
A better life to live 
Stop to hate 
Learn to forgive 
Even power can kill 
The human race 
If we gave life 
A human face (a human face) 
 
And even if you say 
We're gonna die today 
I'm still living for tomorrow 
I'm living for today 
Cause love will find a way my friend 
Whatever it will take 
I'm still living for tomorrow 
I'm living for today 
Why don't we try today my friend 
To make this world a better place (a better place) 
 
And even if you say 
We're gonna die today 
I'm still living for tomorrow 
I'm living for today 
Cause love will find a way my friend 
Whatever it will take 
I'm still living for tomorrow 
I'm living for today 
Why don't we try today my friend 
To make this world a better place 
 
I'm still living for tomorrow

LONELY NIGHTS

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Since you're gone 
There is an empty space 
Since you're gone 
The world is not the same 
 
I go back to the places we've been 
It feels like you're still there 
I live all those moments again 
Wishing you were here 
 
Since you're gone 
There is an lonely heart 
Since you're gone 
Nothin' is like it was 
 
There are memories all over the place 
Bringin' it back all so clear 
Remember all of those days 
Wishing you were here 
 
All those lonely nights 
I gotta fight for you, yes I do 
Yes I do 
 
Since you're gone 
There is a heart that bleeds 
Since you're gone 
I'm not the man I used to be 
 
I follow you steps in the snow 
The traces disappear 
We know what we've lost when it's gone 
I'm wishing you were here 
 
All those lonely nights 
I gotta fight for you, yes I do 
Yes I do

Flying with the guys 
And my longing for fire 
Crying like last night 
The night which brings me higher 
 
In search of light 
Escape the night one day 
She's lost in time 
Just miss so high 
Time's passing by and I'm 
I'm on my way 
 
In search of light 
Escape the night one day 
She's lost in time 
Just miss so high 
Time's passing by and I'm 
I'm on my way

LOVE 'EM OR LEAVE 'EM

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: James Kottak, Klaus Meine 
 
Blowing'cross the universe 
Like a shooting star that lost its way 
Looking back with no regrets 
Living tor what hasn't happened yet 
 
Love 'em or leave 'em 
No rhyme or reason 
Break out to make out 
No change in the season 
Love 'em or leave 'em 
Put out or get out 
Simple survival 
No more denial 
Love 'em or leave 'em 
 
Roller coaster flies oft the track 
Hits you in the face, stabs you in the back 
They Jake your right, leave nothing left 
Steal you blind, your mind and leave you deaf 
 
Love 'em or leave 'em 
No rhyme or reason 
 State of the nation 
Pure intoxication 
Feel the vibration 
The anticipation 
Simple survival 
No more denial 
 
Dont wanna waste no time 
I'm never losing track 
I've seen il all and so much more 
But I ain't seen nothing yet 
 
Love 'em or leave 'em 
No rhyme or reason 
 State of the nation 
Pure intoxication 
Feel the vibration 
The anticipation 
Simple survival 
No more denial 
 
Love 'em or leave 'em

LOVE OF MY LIFE

 Music: Freddie Mercury 
Lyrics: Freddie Mercury 
 
Love of my life 
You've hurt me 
You've broken my heart 
And now you leave me 
Love of my life 
Can't you see 
Bring it back, bring it back 
Don't take it away from me 
Because you don't know 
What it means to me 
 
Love of my life 
Don't leave me 
You've taken my heart 
You now desert me 
Love of my life 
Can't you see 
Bring it back, bring it back 
Don't take it away from me 
Because you don't know 
What it means to me 
 
You won't remember 
When this is blown over 
And everything's all by the way 
When I get older 
I will be there 
At your side to remind you 
How I still love you, I still love you 
 
Back, bring it back 
Don't take it away from me 
Because you don't know 
What it means to me 
Love of my life 
Love of my life

LOVE ON THE RUN

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell 
 
I love you once 
Rock you twice 
My love's a gun that wants to talk tonight 
I kiss the lust 
Right from your lips 
The way it feels will hit you like a blitz 
 
Day after day 
Day after day I rock the speed 
Night after night 
Night after night 
 
Love on the run 
Always loaded like a gun 
For love 
 
Turn outside in 
And inside out 
With me you'll find the kicks you've never found 
I kiss the pearl 
Right from the shell 
Until You'll feel what all these words can't tell 
Day after day 
Day after day I'm burning free 
Night after night 
Night after night 
 
Love on the run 
Always loaded like a gun 
For love on the run

LOVING YOU SUNDAY MORNING

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell 
 
Working hard to get it on for you 
Everyday and night 
I give you all I've got to give 
Take it all 
Love I know that you're feelin' blue 
Lonely deep inside 
'Cause I know how it feels to be alone 
 
Loving you Sunday morning 
You were on my mind love everyday 
Loving you Sunday morning 
Your love makes me fly so far away 
 
People tell me that I'm gonna lose you 
Our love will die 
So tell me is it true right or wrong 
I never ever wanna lose your love 
So I will change my life 
Believe in me my love 
I'm coming home 
 
Loving you Sunday morning 
You were on my mind love everyday 
Loving you Sunday morning 
Your love makes me fly so far away

LUST OR LOVE

 Music: Klaus Meine 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell, Jim Vallance 
 
The innocence is gone 
But still I'm holding on 
Searchin' for love that lasts forever 
Lookin' for a place 
Where love can hide away 
Takin' a chance it's now or never 
 
Maybe it's time to draw the line 
There's just one thing that's on my mind 
 
Is it lust, is it love 
Whatever it is I can't get enough 
Is it lust, is it love 
When I look around tell me who can I trust 
Is it love 
 
Lovers come and go 
Sometimes it's hard to know 
If this will be a night to treasure 
When the damage has been done 
And the hurting has begun 
You'll justify a moment's pleasure 
 
Is it lust, is it love 
Whatever it is I can't get enough 
Is it lust, is it love 
It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above 
Is it lust, is it love 
When I look around tell me who can I trust 
Is it love 
Lust or love 
 
Maybe it's time to draw the line 
There's just one thing that's on my mind 
 
Is it lust, is it love 
Whatever it is I can't get enough 
Is it lust, is it love 
It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above 
Is it lust, is it love 
Still lookin' for more, it's never enough 
Is it lust, is it love 
When I look around tell me who can I trust 
Is it love, is it love, is it love 
Is it love, is it love

MAYBE I MAYBE YOU

 Music: Anoushirvan Rohani 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Maybe I, maybe you 
Can make a change to the world 
We're reaching out for a soul 
That's kind of lost in the dark 
 
Maybe I, maybe you 
Can find the key to the stars 
To catch the spirit of hope 
To save one hopeless heart 
 
You look up to the sky 
With all those questions in mind 
All you need is to hear 
The voice of your heart 
In a world full of pain 
Someone's calling your name 
Why don't we make if true 
Maybe I, maybe you 
 
Maybe I, maybe you 
Are just dreaming sometimes 
But the world would be cold 
Without dreamers Ilke you 
 
Maybe I, maybe you 
Aree just soldiers of love 
Born to carry the flame 
Bringin' light to the dark 
 
You look up to the sky 
With all those questions in mind 
All you need is to hear 
The voice of your heart 
In a world full of pain 
Someone's calling your name 
Why don't we make if true 
Maybe I, maybe you

Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
They're watching me 
They're watching you 
Taking all the world under control 
They make you laugh 
They make you blue 
In the end they try to eat your soul 
 
Satellites transmit the latest thrill 
We can't escape the media overkill 
 
A purple flash 
The biggest crash 
Totally in tune around the world 
They take you high 
They make you cry 
We are at the point of no return 
 
Satellites transmit the latest thrill 
We can't escape the media overkill 
 
Over and over and over

MOMENT OF GLORY

 Music: Klaus Meine 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
A moment of glory called evolution 
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child 
A new beginning, a moment of freedom 
Like angels are singing a song full of joy 
 
This Side Of Heaven 
Belongs To The Children 
I will be there, when the future arrives 
 
A moment of glory called evolution 
Could I fly away like a bird in the Sky 
No limitation, a new inspiration 
A World that is free just as free as my mind 
 
Communication 
A new destination 
The planet of visions is calling tonight 
 
Another thousand years seem so long 
I m just a passenger 
And the ride ride has just begun 
 
Moment of glory 
A moment of glory called evolution 
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child 
A new beginning, a moment of freedom 
Like angels are singing a song full of joy 
 
This Side Of Heaven 
Belongs To The Children 
I will be there, when the future arrives 
 
Moment of glory

 Music: Matthias Jabs 
Lyrics: Matthias Jabs, Herman Rarebell 
 
You know nothing about loving 
You lost somewhere down the line 
You know nothing about giving 
You should draw the line 
 
You keep looking out for something 
Something you're never gonna find 
When will, will you show your feelings 
You will lose your mind 
 
Who's to blame my love 
You play a dangerous game 
Who's to blame my love 
All you want is money and fame 
 
You play, play with emotions 
You need, need a stepping stone 
You're out, out for sensations 
Don't you, don't you feel alone 
 
Who's to blame my love 
You play a dangerous game 
Who's to blame my love 
All you want is money and fame 
 
Who's to blame my love 
You play a dangerous game 
Who's to blame my love 
All you want is money and fame 
 
Money and fame

Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I thought I knew you baby 
But it seems I don't know, I don't know you at all 
One thing is for sure is you're so bad 
And then again, when you kiss me baby 
You know it's got the taste 
The taste of an eternal life 
I want you to feel the taste of life 
This moment in time 
I hear the call of a siren 
This lady is quite 
Mysterious 
I want your mind to lock in 
If my life were a glass of water 
Filled by the rain from a velvet sky 
I want you to drink 
Because your lips are dry 
This moment in time 
I follow her blind 
This lady is quite 
Mysterious 
I want your mind to lock in 
This time I tought I got you baby 
But you slipped away 
And I tought I'd die 
This moment in time 
I'm losing my mind 
But she remains quite 
Mysterious 
I'm crossing the line 
I will follow her blind 
This lady is quite 
Mysterious 
I want your mind to lock in 
I'm losing my mind 
I hear the call of a siren 
This lady is quite 
Mysterious 
I want your mind to lock in 
You're so bad 
I thought I knew you baby 
But I don't know you at all 
It's got the taste you know it's got the taste 
Of an eternal life

NEW GENERATION

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
Another day no peace in sight 
A solution, far away 
The military won the war 
Certainly not for you and me 
 
How many generations will it take 
To cut the stream of blood 
I hear voices that spin inside my head 
It's your voice that counts so much 
 
Here comes the young, 
the new generation 
You are the only ones 
You are the only ones who can make a change 
 
The world looks kind of small from way up there 
Through the window of our time 
The shuttle broke into a million pieces 
In the bluest sky 
 
The world is spinning round way too fast 
And New York City went all dark 
There's a message that goes out tonight 
From the bottom of my heart 
 
Here comes the young, the new generation 
You are the only ones 
You are the only ones who can make a change 
Here comes the young, the new generation 
You are the only ones 
You are the only ones who can make a change 
 
Always hold on to your dreams 
Because the world is not the same 
The day your hope will die 
Just carry on for you and me 
 Cause it's the spark inside that flame 
That gives your visions life 
 
Here comes the young, the new generation 
You are the only ones 
You are the only ones who can make a change 
Here comes the young, the new generation 
You are the only ones 
You are the only ones who can make a change 
 
We are we are the new generation 
We are the only ones 
We are the only ones who can make a change

 Music: Matthias Jabs 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Mark Hudson 
 
Last night I went to kill 
Some time at the famous grill 
Where the tall eats the small 
There were girls all over me 
That's my insanity 
Don't call me Ringo, call me Paul 
 
I'm in heaven, I'm in hell 
Don't wipe that smile off my face 
Can't you tell 
I see faces in the weirdest places 
Please, won't you take me down 
Underneath you spell 
 
Oh, oh I'm back at midnight (alright) 
I drop my keys, could you get 'em love 
Oh, oh baby I might (he might) 
I got the stuff to keep it goin' on all night 
 
Take me down nightmare avenue 
Goin' down nightmare avenue 
I wanna take you too 
 
Sharp as a sabres tooth 
Back in my favorite booth 
I'm getting spanked with cold champagne 
I'd walk on a razor blade 
If you're dressed like a French maid 
I get my pleasure out of pain 
 
I'm in heaven, I'm in hell 
Don't wipe that smile off my face 
Can't you tell 
I see faces in the weirdest places 
Please, won't you take me down 
Underneath you spell 
 
Oh, oh I'm back at midnight (alright) 
I drop my keys, could you get 'em love 
Oh, oh baby I might (he might) 
I got the stuff to keep it goin' on all night 
 
Take me down nightmare avenue 
Goin' down nightmare avenue 
Drive me down nightmare avenue 
Lay me down on nightmare avenue 
 
Take me down nightmare avenue 
Goin' down nightmare avenue 
Drive me down nightmare avenue 
Lay me down on nightmare avenue 
 
And I've gonna take you too

Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart 
Much too long for a man who needs love 
I miss you since I've been away 
Babe, it wasn't easy to leave you alone 
It's getting harder each time that I go 
If I had the choice, I would stay 
 
There's no one like you 
I can't wait for the nights with you 
I imagine the things we'll do 
I just wanna be loved by you 
 
No one like you 
I can't wait for the nights with you 
I imagine the things we'll do 
I just wanna be loved by you 
 
Girl, there are really no words strong enough 
To describe all my longing for love 
I don't want my feelings restrained 
Ooh, babe, I just need you like never before 
Just imagine you'd come through this door 
You'd take all my sorrow away 
 
There's no one like you 
I can't wait for the nights with you 
I imagine the things we'll do

Get on your feet open the door 
Walk on down you know the score

No pain no gain 
 
No time for losers you make the call 
Believe in yourself stand tall 
Another day it's in your hand 
You can be the winner in the end 
 
The wake will fall the strong remain 
No pain no gain 
 
Keep runnin' don't look back 
Keep movin' strait ahead

Like it played loud 
Powerhouse sounds 
My body wants to rock and let it out 
Really high born 
Morning till dawn 
I'm going all the way just on and on 
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild 
It's gonna be wild 
Now! 
 
Teach me to fly 
Wanna stay high 
I have to live it up before I die 
Nightlife and booze 
Girls to choose 
Are you ready, baby, come on let's cruise 
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild 
It's gonna be wild 
Now! 
 
Getting out of control 
There's nothing that can bring me down 
Nothing I'll leave out tonight 
I'm feeling good, I'm living now! 
 
Like it real hot 
Never can't stop 
I'm running down the line to the top 
Never stay low 
I'm on the go 
No one holds me back 
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild 
It's gonna be wild 
Now! 
 
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild 
It's gonna be wild 
Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now!

Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Girl I don't think of you 
At least that's what I try to do 
And I just miss those days 
Our secret little place, Oh well 
But I'll be there 
Anytime your heart is desperate just to love someone 
I want you to call my now 
Cause it feels so good to be your lover 
When my lips are kissing you all over 
And no matter what I do I can't get you off my mind 
I just want this night to last forever 
It can not get any better 
In my life 
Now I don't feel the pain 
My world went upside down insane 
And I don't miss those nights 
Now maybe that's a lie as well 
Still I'll be there 
Anytime your heart is desperate just to love someone 
I want you to call my now 
Cause it feels so good to be your lover 
When my lips are kissing you all over 
And no matter what I do I can't get you off my mind 
I just want this night to last forever 
It can not get any better 
In my life 
And I'll be there 
Anytime your heart is desperate just to love someone 
I want you to call my now 
Cause it feels so good to be your lover 
When my lips are kissing you all over 
And no matter what I do I can't get you off my mind 
I just want this night to last forever 
It can not get any better 
In my life 
There's nothing left to do 
But to say those words to you 
Oh yes I do

Do do do do 
 
Away for a long time but never gone 
So many good times that I recall 
Forgive me that I've been kind of blind 
I've been running away most of my life 
 
Girl, I wanna be with you 
It's no one else it's only you 
Oh, girl I wanna stay with you 
With no one else just with you 
 
I was lost for a long time couldn't find myself 
The cry for love was the cry for help 
Forgive me that I've been so untrue 
The one who saved me's been always you (yeah) 
 
Girl, I wanna be with you 
It's no one else it's only you 
Oh, girl I wanna stay with you 
With no one else just with you 
With no one else just with you 
 
Life's been dancin' on a razorblade 
I had my share of love and hate 
Well,after all I found myself 
Cause it's you who makes me live 
It's only you who can forgive 
 
Away for a long time but never gone 
Sometimes life just takes the long way home 
You're still the one I'm dreamin' of 
Cause when your heart is talkin' you know it's love 
 
Oh, girl, I wanna be with you 
It's no one else it's only you 
Oh, girl I wanna stay with you 
With no one else just with you 
 
Oh, girl, I wanna be with you 
It's no one else it's only you 
Oh, girl I wanna stay with you 
With no one else just with you 
With no one else just with you

ONLY A MAN

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell 
 
Well you know it is hard 
Being a long time apart 
But it's you that I love, don't you see 
 
And when I go away 
You say, please stay okay 
I want you to stay only with me 
 
Well you know it is hard 
All these girls are so smart 
And they see me all over the place 
 
Well they phone me at night 
Ask me out for a bite 
I can see all the lust in their face 
 
All these chicks really know 
That next day I will go 
And they will never see me again 
 
So when I'm back home 
And we both are alone 
I can feel all you love and your pain 
 
Woman, I'm only a man 
Do the best that I can as you know 
Woman, I'm only a man 
Do the best that I can as you know 
Now you know how I feel 
Nothing is real 
 
Well it's hard to say no 
When you've done a good show 
And they all want you to celebrate 
 
Well I try to refuse 
Try to make some excuse 
But at this point it's mostly too late 
 
Yeah, I start feeling good 
And I get in the mood 
I guess, you'll know what I mean 
 
These chicks all around 
It's so hard to keep count 
It's like a schizophrenic dream 
 
Woman, I'm only a man 
Do the best that I can as you know 
Woman, I'm only a man 
Do the best that I can as you know 
Now you know how I feel 
Nothing is real 
 
Well you know it is hard 
Being a long time apart 
But it's you that I love, don't you see 
 
And when I go away 
You say, please stay okay 
I want you to stay only with me 
 
Well you know it is hard 
All these girls are so smart 
And they see me all over the place 
 
Well they phone me at night 
Ask me out for a bite 
I can see all the lust in their face 
 
Woman, I'm only a man 
Do the best that I can as you know 
Woman, I'm only a man 
Do the best that I can as you know 
Now you know how I feel 
Nothing is real 
 
Woman, I'm only a man 
Do the best that I can as you know 
Woman, I'm only a man 
Do the best that I can as you know 
Now you know how I feel 
Nothing is real

PICTURED LIFE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Ulrich Roth 
 
Ooh! Dark meditation, 
Your second sight can show my light 
In a crystal ball. 
Sweet are the days, intoxication 
Crow black the nights caging my mind 
Behind the wall. 
 
Into the rock through walls of red dreams 
Into the rock to find the cream 
Into the rock through walls of red dreams 
Pictured life from yesterday. 
 
Ooh! Dark meditation, 
Deep down inside a stream of light 
Begins to flow. 
Sweet are the days, intoxication 
Crow black the nights caging my mind 
Behind the wall. 
 
Into the rock through walls of red dreams 
Into the rock to find the cream 
Into the rock through walls of red dreams 
Pictured life from yesterday. 
 
Pictured life, pictured life 
Pictured life from yesterday ...

POLAR NIGHTS

 Music: Ulrich Roth 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
Down, down ... 
That's bringing me down 
The stars in the sky 
Seem to fall to the ground. 
Time, time ... 
I'm chasing the time 
The stars in the sky 
Seem to be turning round. 
Is that the wind in your eyes 
That is soothing my mind? 
Is that the night of your eyes 
That is soothing my mind? 
 
Round, round ... 
My mind's whirling round 
The moons in the sky 
Seem to burn on the ground. 
Gone, gone ... 
My mightmares are gone 
The moons in the sky 
Seemed to eat up the sun. 
Is that the wind in your eyes 
That is soothing my mind? 
Is that the night in your eyes 
That is soothing my mind? 
Back from polar nights ... 
 
I was down ... 
I was out ... 
The nights at the pole've been 
So cold without you! 
I was down ... 
I was out ... 
The pole star was bringing me 
Back home to you. 
Is that the wind in your eyes 
That is soothing my mind? 
Is that the night in your eyes 
That is soothing my mind?

PRISCILLA

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
She likes it hot, she likes it humid 
She likes my cake, and she's not stupid 
She likes my sugar, she likes my bread 
I'm ready to attack 
She comes at night, when I'm asleep 
Without a sound, just like a thief 
She comes to crawl, under my bed 
I'm ready to attack 
Priscilla oh Priscilla 
You last resistant chiller 
Priscilla oh Priscilla 
Tonight I'm going to kill ya 
She lives in my kitchen 
Down in the shade 
She likes leftovers 
And throwaways 
I'm on a diet 
And she is fat 
I'm ready to attack 
Priscilla oh Priscilla 
You last resistant chiller 
Priscilla oh Priscilla 
Tonight I'm going to kill ya 
I can't do it I can't do it at all 
She turns a man into killer 
This cockroach named Priscilla 
This cockroach named Priscilla 
You're gonna be here 
You're gonna be there 
You're gonna be everywhere 
I'm coming after you 
I'm coming after you 
You're gonna be now 
You're gonna be then 
You're gonna be out and in 
I'm coming after you 
I'm coming after you 
You're gonna be saint 
You're gonna be sin 
You're gonna lose and win 
I'm coming after you 
I'm coming after you 
Priscilla oh Priscilla 
Tonight I'm going to kill ya

REMEMBER THE GOOD TIMES

 Music: Rudolf Schenker, Eric Bazilian 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Eric Bazilian 
 
Good times bad times 
Bad times good times 
 
We were twisting Chubby Checker style 
In a roaring sixties summer night 
We walked the moon and we were free 
When Jimi played guitar 
We shared a dream with Martin Luther King 
We saw J.F.K. in West Berlin 
When he spoke those famous words that day 
Our world was not the same 
 
Remember the good times 
Remember the bad times 
Remembering my life, your life 
Let the film just roll 
 
We were lost in shock, the world was doomed 
Nikita hit us with a shoe 
We watched the world go upside down 
When the Kennedys got shot 
We were screaming when the world was fab 
We had Rock 'n' Roll invade our hearts 
We had Elvis, Janis, Marilyn 
And hair, to let it grow 
 
Remember the good times 
Remember the bad times 
Remembering my life, your life 
Let the film just roll 
Remember the good times 
Remember the bad times 
Remembering my life, your life 
We're still standing after all 
Back in the cold war 
Our hearts were warm 
Just because sex was free 
In the summer of love 
 
Remember the good times 
Remember the bad times 
Remembering my life, your life 
Let the film just roll 
Remember the good times 
Remember the bad times 
Remembering my life, your life 
We're still standing after all 
 
Good times bad times 
Bad times good times 
 
I m still standing 
Let the film just roll 
I'm still standing 
We're still standing after all

RESTLESS NIGHTS

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell, Jim Vallance 
 
Blackout in London 
Just slip'n slide 
Blackout in London 
I'm just about to lose my mind 
Big time in Paris 
Time's gonna fly 
Big time in Paris 
It's c'est la vie for me tonight 
 
Here I go 
To take the one and only road I know 
In my life 
Here I go 
Another place to bare my heart and soul 
Restless nights 
 
Hot shot in Dallas 
A wild horse to ride 
Hot shot in Dallas 
I don't know how but I survived 
Rock hard in Rio 
Pure sex and crime 
Rock hard in Rio 
It's just too much to take tonight 
 
Here I go 
To take the one and only road I know 
In my life 
Here I go 
Another place to bare my heart and soul 
Restless nights 
 
Restless nights 
Restless nights 
 
Red hot in Moscow 
Turn back the tide 
Red hot in Moscow 
The eagle rocks the bear tonight 
Die hard in Tokyo 
Lexington nights 
Die hard in Tokyo 
I barely made it out alive 
 
Here I go 
To take the one and only road I know 
In my life 
Here I go 
Another place to bare my heart and soul 
Restless nights

RHYTHM OF LOVE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Let's spend the night together 
I know you want it too 
The magic of the moment 
Is what I've got for you 
The heartbeat of this night 
Is made to lose control 
And there is something in your eyes 
That's longing for some more 
Let us find together 
The beat we're looking for 
 
The rhythm of love 
Keeps me dancing on the road 
The rhythm of love 
Got the groove that hits the bone 
The rhythm of love 
Is the game I'm looking for 
The rhythm of love 
Is the heartbeat of my soul 
 
Let's reach the top together 
One night will never do 
An exploding shot of pleasure 
Is what I've got for you 
Why don't you close your eyes 
And let your feeling grow 
I make you feel the taste of life 
Until your love will flow 
Let us find together 
The beat we're longing for 
 
The rhythm of love 
Keeps me dancing on the road 
The rhythm of love 
Got the groove that hits the bone 
The ryhthm of love 
Is the game I'm looking for 
The rhythm of love 
Is the heartbeat of my soul 
 
Let us find together 
The beat we're looking for

ROCK YOU LIKE A HURRICANE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker

It's early morning 
The sun comes out 
Last night was shaking 
And pretty loud 
My cat is purring 
And scratches my skin 
So what is wrong 
With another sin 
The bitch is hungry 
She needs to tell 
So give her inches 
And feed her well 
More days to come 
New places to go 
I've got to leave 
It's time for a show 
 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
 
My body is burning 
It starts to shout 
Desire is coming 
It breaks out loud 
Lust is in cages 
Till storm breaks loose 
Just have to make it 
With someone I choose 
The night is calling 
I have to go 
The wolf is hungry 
He runs the show 
He's licking his lips 
He's ready to win 
On the hunt tonight 
For love at first sting 
 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane 
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

The wise man said just walk this way 
To the dawn of the light 
The wind will blow into your face 
As the years pass you by 
Hear this voice from deep inside 
It's the call of your heart 
Close your eyes and your will find 
The passage out of the dark 
 
Here I am 
Will you send me an angel 
Here I am 
In the land of the morning star 
 
The wise man said just find your place 
In the eye of the storm 
Seek the roses along the way 
Just beware of the thorns 
 
Here I am 
Will you send me an angel 
Here I am 
In the land of the morning star 
 
The wise man said just raise your hand 
And reach out for the spell 
Find the door to the promised land 
Just believe in yourself 
Hear this voice from deep inside 
It's the call of your heart 
Close your eyes and your will find 
The way out of the dark

Here I am 
In the land of the morning star 
 
The wise man said just raise your hand 
And reach out for the spell 
Find the door to the promised land 
Just believe in yourself 
Hear this voice from deep inside 
It's the call of your heart 
Close your eyes and your will find 
The way out of the dark 
 
Here I am 
Will you send me an angel 
Here I am 
In the land of the morning star 
Here I am 
Will you send me an angel 
Here I am 
In the land of the morning star

SHE S KNOCKING AT MY DOOR

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
She's knocking at my door 
That little angel knows the score 
She's knocking at my door 
But I won't let her out no more 
 
 
I want a piece of that pie 
She's driving me completely wild 
She's giving me a private dance 
She's playing with my confidence 
The way she's coming down the stairs 
Makes me surrender 
just right there 
This girl is out of this world 
Heaven must be a place on earth 
 
 
She's knocking at my door 
That little angel knows the score 
She's knocking at my door 
But I won't let her out no more 
 
 
She's like a shot of adrenaline 
She made me fly with broken wings 
With nothing but the radio on 
Her body is the song I want 
 
 
She's knocking at my door 
That little angel knows the score 
She's knocking at my door 
But I won't let her out no more 
 
 
The light is on but no one's home tonight 
We lock the door, 
we turn the key 
And throw it right outside 
Come on and set me free 
If you had candy once before 
For you keep coming back for more 
She's got the sweetest touch of all 
The longest legs that I recall 
Before she leaves she turns around 
The elevator takes her down 
She says oh well the city rocks 
I go to sleep but then it knocks 
 
 
She's knocking at my door 
That little angel knows the score 
She's knocking at my door 
But I won't let her out no more

SHE SAID

 Music: Christian Kolonovits, Klaus Meine 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
In every corner of my memory 
There's no place you wouldn't be 
lf anything, I wish I had 
Another dream with you 
Life was forever yesterday 
Nothing in the world could take 
Your love away, will I ever know 
That time will ease the pain 
For me someday 
 
She said I won't leave you, ever 
Just love me forever 
She said you can leave, but never 
Walk away 
 
Lights reflecting in the evening sun 
Back to the place where we were one 
Soul mates forever about to chase 
Rainbows in the dark 
Another day to destiny 
Come on and set me free 
When I close my eyes, I see your smile 
As I walk in the pouring rain 
I call your name 
 
She said I won't leave you, ever 
Just love me forever 
She said, we will be together, someday 
She said I won't leave you, ever 
Just love me forever 
She said, you can leave, but never 
Walk away 
 
I can see a million faces 
When I take a walk outside 
But I just never knew 
That I could go a million places 
And I'd see always, only you 
 
The loneliness crawls up on me 
Without you there's no me 
At any time or any place 
But time will ease the pain 
For me someday 
 
She said I won't leave you, ever 
Just love me forever 
She said, we will be together, someday 
She said, I will wait forever 
I won't leave you ever 
She said, you can leave, but never 
Ever walk away 
 
Don't walk away 
Oh no don't walk away 
I'II be waiting, always 
Until you'Il wake up from this dream 
Someday

SHIP OF FOOLS

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Another bloody Monday 
Thirty nine Just died 
All hell breaks loose in the crowd 
A hopeless helter skelter 
Another mindless crime 
Some corner of the world is burning down 
 
Heading for a nervous breakdown 
Can't take it anymore 
I see the fear explode just like 
A thousant nights before 
 
The ship of fools 
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm 
It won't take long 'till we collide 
The ship of fools 
Keeps on following the siren's call 
Damned to be sacrificed 
 
Corrupt politicians 
Promise paradise 
The thieves are reaching out for the crown 
Violence is a killer 
Threatens all our lives 
Judgment day has come here and now 
 
Heading for a nervous breakdown 
Can't take it anymore 
I see the fear explode just like 
A thousant nights before 
 
The ship of fools 
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm 
It won't take long 'till we collide 
The ship of fools 
Keeps on following the siren's call 
Damned to be sacrificed 
 
Heading for a nervous breakdown 
Can't take it anymore 
I see the fear explode just like 
A thousant nights before 
 
The ship of fools 
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm 
It won't take long 'till we collide 
The ship of fools 
Keeps on following the siren's call 
Damned to be sacrificed 
 
The ship of fools 
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm 
It won't take long 'till we collide 
The ship of fools 
Keeps on following the siren's call 
Damned to be sacrificed

Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
You have got a body to 
To make a man just lose his mind 
To give me a shiver send it down to my spine 
It's all because of 
You have got a body to 
To bring a man down on his knees 
Just let me inside don't leave me begging please 
Don't ever go 
Everybody knows 
That I'm under the spell of your love 
Got nothing but you on my mind 
That's the way it goes 
It's no wonder you're tearing my heart 
Simply in pieces tonight 
You have got a body to 
To make a man just sell his soul 
Right to the devil I think after all 
I should have known 
Everybody knows 
That I'm under the spell of your love 
Got nothing but you on my mind 
Everybody knows 
And I wonder if you know it too 
I skywrite your name way up high 
In the sky in the sky in the sky 
To bring a man down on his knees 
Just let me inside don't leave me begging please 
Don't ever go 
Everybody knows 
That I'm under the spell of your love 
Got nothing but you on my mind 
That's the way it goes 
It's no wonder you're tearing my heart 
Simply in pieces tonight 
Everybody knows 
That I'm under the spell of your love 
Got nothing but you on my mind 
Everybody knows 
And I wonder if you know it too 
I skywrite your name way up high 
In the sky in the sky in the sky

SOMEDAY IS NOW

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: James Kottak 
 
Blood rains down across the tundra 
Ice flows through my veins 
As my life drains 
Northern bound, my dogs are dying 
But I still know 
That nothing is impossible 
 
I can feel I m getting stronger, the longer 
I m pushed to the limit 
Said I d do it someday 
Someday is now 
When I see the world around me receding 
No time for bleeding 
Show the world how 
Someday is now 
 
Eight steps till I reach the summit 
My line breaks and I fall down 
The rocky terrain 
My bones are broken into pieces 
My mind can t wait 
To get up and do it again 
 
I can feel I m getting stronger, the longer 
I m pushed to the limit 
Said I d do it someday 
Someday is now 
When I see the the sun is shining, I m flying 
There s no time for crying 
I m gonna win someday 
 
No turning back, no more yesterdays 
I just won t get lost in the haze 
All my tomorrows, no sadness, no sorrow 
Watch out for the rest of my days 
 
Stronger, the longer 
I m pushed to the limit 
Said I d do it someday 
Someday is now 
When I see the the sun is shining, I m flying 
There s no room for crying 
I m gonna win some way 
Someday is now

SOMEONE TO TOUCH

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Mark Hudson 
 
I'm an alleycat with only seven lives 
I'm the trouble scratching at your door 
When the moon is bright and shining high 
I'm getting loose just like the night before 
One for the money, two for the show 
You can't resist it on a night like this 
I'm the answer baby and you know 
Tonight you're mine, forget the guy you're with 
 
Baby I don't care 
If I have to crawl an extra mile 
'cause you can take me everywhere 
And you're the one I really need tonight 
 
Someone to touch 
I need a girl like you 
Someone to touch 
That somebody could be you 
 
Don't try to tell me that your daddy's mean 
You think your mama wouldn't let me in 
Come on 'n step inside my dream machine 
Don't fight it honey you just can't win 
 
'cause baby I don't care 
If I have to crawl an extra mile 
'cause you can take me everywhere 
And you're the one I really need tonight 
 
Someone to touch 
I need a girl like you 
Someone to touch 
That somebody could be you 
Someone to touch 
I need a girl like you 
Someone to touch 
C'mon baby, I think it's you

SOUL BEHIND THE FACE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Would you care for me if I was deaf and blind 
Would you hear my voice if I was always quiet 
Would you hold my hand if I was going to fall 
Would you cry for me would you know my name at all 
 
Would you be there if I was on the ground 
Would you be my friend if no one was around 
Would you hold me close if I was in the cold 
Would you pray for me would you know my name at all 
 
Would you care would you be there 
For the soul behind the face 
Would you love me for what I am 
 
Would you care would you be there 
For the soul behind the face 
Would you love me for what I am 
 
Would you care would you be there 
For the soul behind the face 
Would you love me for what I am 
 
Would you care would you be there 
For the soul behind the face 
Would you love me for what I am 
 
Would you love me for what I am 
Would you love me for what I am 
Would you love me for what I am

Time, it needs time 
To win back your love again 
I will be there, I will be there 
Love, only love

If we'd go again 
All the way from the start 
I would try to change 
The things that killed our love 
Your pride has built a wall, so strong 
That I can't get through 
Is there really no chance 
To start once again 
I'm loving you 
 
Try, baby try 
To trust in my love again 
I will be there, I will be there

STONE IN MY SHOE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I keep on dancin' on the roof 
Try not to fall, stay in the groove 
A step too far. I'm out of place 
Life beats you up some of these days 
Just like a whisper there's a voice 
Inside of me 
It's sayin' you ain't got a choice 
Well, can't you see 
 
Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down 
Ooh, you better find a way around 
 
I keep on walkin' in the clouds 
Find out what life is all about 
I keep on runnin' away from here 
To learn the grass ain't greener there 
Just like a whisper there's a voice 
Inside of me 
It's sayin' you ain't got no choice 
As you can see 
 
Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down 
Ooh, you better find a way around 
Ooh, cause no one else but you 
Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe 
 
Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down 
Ooh, you better find a way around 
Ooh, cause no one else but you 
Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe 
 
Inside your shoe 
Inside your shoe 
Inside your shoe 
Yeah 
 
Keep rockin' in the street 
Keep landing on my feet 
Keep runnin' on and on 
Still play my favorite blond 
Keep rockin' mother earth 
Just all around the world 
These days mean safer sex 
Get my survival pack 
My orgasm isn't faked 
Ooh Lord, I need a break 
And what's annoying, too 
Is that damn thing in my shoe 
Ooh, there is a stone in my shoe

Before madness shows her lucid feathers in the Sky... 
 
How can you lose your mind 
How can you waste your time only like that ? 
Look at the sun inside of my hand so bright 
I call it music 
And if you touch you'll see 
It comes from infinity 
It's made forever 
You will not touch in vain 
Music will make you sane 
Will make you sane

Show me the white rolls royce in the rain 
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine 
Show me the white rolls royce in the rain

Too hard a body drives me mad 
Oh yeah it's like a drum 
To stay in love baby 
 
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine 
Show me the white rolls royce in the rain 
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine 
Show me the white rolls royce in the rain 
 
Ah, ah, oh yeah 
Ah, ha, ah, ha, ha 
Oh baby yeah

TAXMAN WOMAN

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I wake up in the morning I'm thinking of you 
In Dollars and Cents in high heel shoes 
 
I start to think and the headache goes boom 
I'm counting the bills that are stacked to the moon 
 
The money I'm giving to you 
I could live on forever (on the sunny side) 
What can I do so my life 
Turns around for the better (Got knows that I tried) 
 
Taxman woman I keep running 
Can't you see it's only money 
Taxman woman I keep running 
Can't you see it's so hard honey 
To keep up with you 
 
I work twice as hard what else can I do 
To make up the part that's been taken by you 
 
If it wasn't for you I would be rich 
But instead I'm a poor son of a bitch 
 
The money I'm giving to you 
I could live on forever (on the sunny side) 
What can I do so my life 
Turns around for the better (Got knows that I tried) 
 
Taxman woman I keep running 
Can't you see it's only money 
Taxman woman I keep running 
Can't you see it's so hard honey 
Taxman woman I keep running 
Can't you see that it ain't funny 
Taxman woman I keep running 
Can't you see it's so hard honey 
To keep up with you

TEASE ME PLEASE ME

 Music: Matthias Jabs, Jim Vallance 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell, Jim Vallance 
 
I've been around the world 
I've known a lot of girls 
Livin' and lovin' 
It's hard to keep them all in line 
I've seen a lot of sights 
Many crazy nights 
Cruisin' and boozin' 
It's a wonder that I'm still alive 
 
Never wasted any time 
Never missed a beat 
Total satisfaction 
Always guaranteed 
 
Tease me 
Please me 
No one needs to know 
Tease me 
Please me 
Before I have to go 
 
Spead the world around 
The boys are back in town 
Reelin' and rockin' 
We're rollin' with it win or lose 
The girls are dressed to kill 
Lookin' for a thrill 
Slidin' and glidin' 
Sometimes they make it hard to choose 
 
I never wasted any time 
Never missed a beat 
Total satisfaction 
Always guaranteed 
 
Tease me 
Please me 
No one needs to know 
Tease me 
Please me 
Before I have to go 
Tease me 
Please me 
We'll take it nice and slow 
Tease me 
Please me 
Just let the feeling grow

THE RIOT OF YOUR TIME

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
The only king of rock has gone gone to heaven 
a star on the way to the stars 
another king of rock is born, '77 
just born to be there, when it starts 
 
'94,'95, if the world is still alive 
will be the start, for the riot of your time 
here's a ticket for a burning train 
to set the world in flame 
to play the hero game 
here's a ticket for the future days 
you'll be the x rock king 
 the new electric face 
a new generations mind 
 the riot of your time 
 
He's got the message to be more, 
 a new desire 
a storm full of life, wild and young 
 the x rock 1994 electric fire 
will burn out the time, like the sun

THE SAILS OF CHARON

 Music: Ulrich Roth 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
Dark night! There is no light 
in the realm of the black magic man 
Souls flight into the cold blight 
of the destroyers magic land 
Poor man! Those spirits are stronger 
 there the one's who will reign 
 your strugglings are in vain 
Blind man! You're sucking your own blood 
soon black magic's dying 
you'd better start crying 
 Burn out! Your evil desire 
 the dark Angels Kingdom 
 is built out of mine. 
Keep on! For the Kingdom of light 
 there is no darkness 
and there is no night.

THE SAME THRILL

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I remember when my teacher said: 
 How you wanna make your life? 
I said: I can play guitar 
And it will be alright listen! 
 
When I came out of school 
They said: Which way you wanna go? 
But there was no way strong enough 
Compared with rock'n roll 
To get the same thrill 
 
Anyhow I've found a job 
They tried to break me with their rules 
But they had no chance at all 
'Cause I knew what to do 
To get the same thrill like rock'n roll 
 
I had a feeling they couldn't buy 
Still got that feeling they still can't buy, 
they still can't buy, 
they still can't buy 
 
Tell me the alternative 
To what I'm doing, but I guess 
There's no other way of life 
Which is strong like this 
To get the same thrill like rock'n roll

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
The job is done and I go out 
Another boring day 
I leave it all behind me now 
So many worlds away 
 
I meet my girl, she's dressed to kill 
And all we gonna do 
Is walk around to catch the thrill 
On streets we call the zoo 
 
We eat the night, we drink the time 
Make our dreams come true 
And hungry eyes are passing by 
On streets we call the zoo 
 
We eat the night, we drink the time 
Make our dreams come true 
And hungry eyes are passing by 
On streets we call the zoo 
 
Enjoy the zoo 
And walk down 42nd Street 
You wanna be excited too 
And you will feel the heat 
 
We eat the night, we drink the time 
Make our dreams come true 
And hungry eyes are passing by 
On streets we call the zoo 
 
We eat the night, we drink the time 
Make our dreams come true 
And hungry eyes are passing by 
On streets we call the zoo

THEY NEED A MILLION

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I see a rainbow in the sky 
So many colors and the light 
I see the world and I see all the people 
How they're running all the time 
 
I see your shadow over me 
Then in my ears I hear a symphony 
I see the world and I see all the people 
What they are doing what they need 
 
They need a million and a billion 
And your money too 
They need a million and a billion 
And your moeny too 
 
I feel fine though I realize 
That I don't need the million 
They are all poor 
 
I feel fine though I have eyes 
To see my world and all it skits on ice 
 
I feel fine though I realize 
That I don't need the million 
They are all poor 
 
I feel fine though I have eyes 
To see my world and all it skits on ice

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I can't believe what the people say 
There's only hate everywhere 
So many people go different ways 
So many things don't you care 
 
They see nobody, they see themselves 
But a stage like in a show 
They see the hell, and they need your help 
They need your help, they need love, love 
 
This is my song 
I tell you about the story of love 
This is my song 
I tell you about the story of love 
 
This is my song 
I tell you about the story of love 
This is my song 
I tell you about the story of love 
 
I think I need you, you need me too 
The place where we live is here 
The world is griping what can I do 
For you and you everywhere 
 
I sing this song 'bout the world of love 
And hope you hear what I say 
Forever freedom, forever love 
Forever love everyday

Lyrics: Matthias Jabs 
 
I wanna know what you ve got to say 
Don t wanna wait any longer 
I feel a shook up since you walked my way 
You make me feel so much stronger 
 
Hey little baby 
I wanna go your way 
 
This time 
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love 
This time 
Don t wanna be a part of playing the game of higher love 
When you re mine 
 
Now you see what you ve done to me 
Don t wanna wait so much longer 
I feel sideways up since you walked my way 
My feel for you keeps getting stronger 
 
Hey little baby 
I wanna go your way 
 
This time 
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love 
This time 
Don t wanna be a part of playing the game of higher love 
Just make you mine

THROUGH MY EYES

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Leaving through the back door 
Freezing in the cold 
Communication breakdown 
Emotional overload 
Been through a wall of fire 
Now I feel like, the ashes glow 
 
Cars passing on the freeway 
My mind is on the run 
I keep running from my shadow 
I m not the only one 
Somewhere in the distance 
Someone s taking flight 
Destination unknown 
Just fade into the light 
 
There s so much said and done 
But after all 
The time has come, to leave it all 
Behind 
 
If you could see it through my eyes 
You s know I tried to change it all 
I ve been trying all my life 
To stand up every time I fall 
If you could see it through my eyes 
 
I feel sadness up my spine 
The future on my hands 
I m standing here alone 
With open arms again 
Tomorrow ain t no stranger 
There ll be a lucky star 
And love will find it s way 
Into someones heart 
 
Too late for tears 
No time to be confused 
It s just the echo of our 
Swan song 
 
If you could see it through my eyes 
You s know I tried to change it all 
I ve been trying all my life 
To stand up every time I fall 
If you could see it through my eyes 
You d see that love will always wait 
Somewhere out there is my life 
A new love that comes my way 
If you could see it through my eyes 
Through my eyes 
 
What was meant to be forever 
Is breaking all apart 
What was meant to be forever 
Leaves the hole inside my heart 
What was meant to be forever 
We throw it all away 
What was meant to be forever 
Was nothing but a game 
What was meant to be forever 
Is breaking all apart 
What was meant to be forever

TIME WILL CALL YOUR NAME

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
They're days that make you fly 
They're days you wanna cry 
Sometimes the walls come tumbling down 
They're moments in the dark 
When pain just floods your heart 
And you surrender one more time 
 
Just take a walk out in the rain 
With every drop that falls 
You know the sun will shine again 
 
They're days you're naturally high 
They're days you wanna die 
Sometimes your world goes down in flames 
They're moments deep in love 
But when it breaks your heart 
You just surrender one more time 
 
Just take a walk out in the rain 
With every step you make 
You learn that life means constant change 
 
Tomorrow's all that counts 
As life goes round 'n round 
You gotta draw the line 
Goodbye yesterday 
Tomorrow's all that counts 
As life goes round 'n round 
And if you keep the faith 
Time will call your name 
 
Take a walk out in the rain 
With every breath you take 
You feel your soul is free again 
 
Tomorrow's all that counts 
As life goes round 'n round 
You gotta draw the line 
Goodbye yesterday 
Tomorrow's all that counts 
As life goes round 'n round 
And if you keep the faith 
Time will call your name 
Tomorrow's all that counts 
As life goes round 'n round 
You gotta draw the line 
Goodbye yesterday 
Tomorrow's all that counts 
As life goes round 'n round 
And if you keep the faith 
Time will call your name

TO BE NO. 1

 Music: Peter Wolf, Matthias Jabs 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Give me a job 
The one I havn't got 
Don't write me off at anytime 
Don't ever leave me unsatisfied 
I don't wanna come in a second 
I just wanna come 
Don't wanna be the last in line 
Don't wanna be just left behind 
 
And in the evening when I come home 
It is time to throw my dog a bone 
That's when I wear my shirt that says 
In capital letters In capital letters 
 
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one 
(He's got no job, got no blow got no Monica to go to) 
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one 
(He's a superstar, wunderbar, out of touch too much) 
 
Don't tell me I'm small 
An inch too short 
I might not be your size but I'm sure great 
And definitely underpaid 
So give me a job 
The one I haven't got 
Don't tell me I'm too poor to join the club 
To hang out with the big shots 
 
And in the evening when I come home 
It is time to give my dog a bone 
That's when I wear my shirt that says 
In capital letters In capital letters 
 
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one 
(He's got no job, got no blow, got no Monica to go to) 
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one 
(He's a V.I.P. wannabe, all he ever wants is) 
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one 
Isn't it fun fun fun yeah to be number one 
(He's a V.I.P. wannabe all he ever wants is) 
To be number one 
 
And in the evening when I come home 
It is time to throw my dog a bone 
That's when I wear my shirt that says 
In capital letters In capital letters 
 
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one 
(He's got no job, got no blow got no Monica to go to) 
Isn't it fun fun fun yeah to be number one 
(He's a superstar, wunderbar, out of touch too much) 
 
Isn't it fun fun fun to be number one 
Isn't it fun fun fun fun to be number one 
To be number one 
(Fun, fun, fun) 
To be number one 
To be number one 
(He's got no job, got no blow got no Monica to go to) 
To be number one 
To be number one

To be number one

TO BE WITH YOU IN HEAVEN

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
You can shoot me down 
You can drag me 'round 
Girl I'll get you 
It won't be long 
You can smash my heart 
You can trash our love 
But my desire for you is much too strong 
 
To be with in heaven 
I would go through the darkest hell 
In heaven 
There's no cure for love that kills 
 
You can waste my time 
But you can't change my mind 
I won't stop you 
So just go on 
You can play your games 
But it's all in vain 
Cause' my desire for you is much too strong 
 
To be with in heaven 
I would go through the darkest hell 
In heaven 
There's no cure for love that kills 
To be with in heaven 
I would go through the darkest hell 
In heaven 
There's no cure for love that kills 
 
Girl I'm on fire 
Heaven seems so close tonight 
Girl I would die for your love 
 
You can shoot me down 
You can drag me 'round 
Girl I'll get you 
It won't be long 
You can smash my heart 
You can trash our love 
But my desire for you is much too strong 
 
To be with in heaven 
I would go through the darkest hell 
In heaven 
There's no cure for love that kills 
To be with in heaven 
I would go through the darkest hell 
In heaven 
There's no cure for love that kills 
To be with in heaven 
I would go through the darkest hell 
In heaven 
There's no cure for love that kills

TWENTIETH CENTURY MAN

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
In the jungle of these times 
Honest love's so hard to find 
In the world of video 
Computers tell you what to do 
The world's devoted to the Dollar sign 
 
Remote controlled and on the line 
Plug in man on the rack 
Waiting for a heart attack 
And no chance to die 
 
No more space for love 
The world gets really tough 
Can't you see the end 
Twentieth Century Man? 
 
In the jungle of these times 
There's nothing left for them to buy 
They look for God on the screen 
They've got even dream machines 
They are mesmerized 
 
No more space for love 
The world gets really tough 
Can't you see the end 
Twentieth Century Man? 
 
No more space for love 
The world gets really tough 
Can't you see the end 
Twentieth Century Man?

UNDER THE SAME SUN

 Music: Mark Hudson 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Bruce Fairbairn 
 
I saw the morning 
It was shattered by a gun 
Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried 
I saw a mother 
She was praying for her son 
Bring him back, let him live, don't let him die 
 
Do you ever ask yourself 
Is there a Heaven in the sky 
Why can't we get it right 
 
'cause we all live under the same sun 
We all walk under the same moon 
Then why, why can't we live as one 
 
I saw the evening 
Fading shadows one by one 
We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice 
I saw the children 
The children of the sun 
How they wept, how they bled, how they died 
 
Do you ever ask yourself 
Is there a Heaven in the sky 
Why can't we stop the fight 
 
'cause we all live under the same sun 
We all walk under the same moon 
Then why, why can't we live as one 
 
Sometimes I think I'm going mad 
We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care 
But in my heart it doesn't change 
We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love 
 
And does it really matter 
If there's a heaven up above 
We sure could use some love 
 
'cause we all live under the same sun 
We all walk under the same moon 
Then why, why can't we live as one 
'cause we all live under the same sky 
We all look up at the same stars 
Then why, tell me why can't we live as one

It came up crawling from the ruins of the past 
And I just can't believe my eyes 
It wears the same old face we thought was dead and gone 
Forever buried by the time 
 
Unholy alliance 
Unholy alliance 
 
It came up screaming from the ashes of the grave 
To make this world a battle field 
It's got a voice that steals the courage from the brave 
And leaves a scar that will not heal 
 
Unholy alliance 
Unholy alliance 
 
Don't wanna hear the same old lie that spreads the fear 
Only fools think it's cool 
We must be blind not to see the signs 
How can we dare to look away in the wake of yesterday 
 
Troubled times don't turn your back to the lions 
Troubled times just learn your lesson well 
The party is over 
 
We must be blind not to see the signs 
How can we dare to look away in the wake of yesterday 
 
Troubled times don't turn your back to the lions 
Troubled times just learn your lesson well 
The party is over 
 
Unholy alliance...

VIRGIN KILLER

 Music: Ulrich Roth 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
Cry like you feel, 
Try like you feel, feel it ...! 
Try to escape, 
Cry to escape, escape it ...! 
It's so hard to run away 
He's a virgin killer ... 
 
No, no, no, can't you see? 
No, no, no, can't you see? 
You're a demon's, you're a demon's, 
You're a demon's desire! 
 
Death on the screen, 
Sadistic magazines, watch out 
Suicides ev'ryday, 
Political ways, get it 
Well, you can't find new ways ... 
But he's a virgin killer ... 
 
No, no, no, can't you see? 
No, no, no, can't you see? 
You're a demon's, you're a demon's, 
You're a demon's desire! 
 
Garbage in the streams, 
A bombs in your dreams, look out 
Sharks in the pictures, 
Exorcist prescriptions, forget it 
Try to get away from that, 
Cos he's a virgin killer ... 
 
No, no, no, can't you see? 
No, no, no, can't you see? 
You're a demon's, you're a demon's, 
You're a demon's desire!

WALKING ON THE EDGE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Welcome to a trip 
Into my hurt feelings 
To the center of my soul 
You better bring a light 
To find the house of meanings 
In the labyrinth of yes or no 
For you, life is just like chess 
If you don't make a move 
You'll lose the game like this 
 
Cause you, you're walking on the edge 
You, you chose the way of love and pain 
You, don't you see the bridge 
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again 
 
Welcome to a trip 
Into my emotions 
To the language of my heart 
You're sailing on a river 
That becomes an ocean 
Which you can only cross with love 
For you, life is just like chess 
If you don't make a move 
You'll lose the game like this 
 
Cause you, you're walking on the edge 
You, you chose the way of love and pain 
You, don't you see the bridge 
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again

WE LET IT ROCK...YOU LET IT ROLL

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
We come to you through a storm of lightning 
To drive this place totally insane 
Another show that really keeps us fighting 
For what it takes to blow your mind away 
Hey you, are you ready for tonight 
Can you hear me now 
Let me hear you too 
 
We come to you through a wall of thunder 
Electrified by the sound of the guitars 
Hey you, are you ready for tonight 
Can you see me now 
I wanna see you out there 
 
We let it rock to free your energy 
You let it roll, come on get on your feet 
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams 
You let it roll, up to the ecstasy 
 
We come to you through a burst of fire 
Energized by the feedback of the crowd 
Hey you, are you ready for tonight 
Can you feel me now 
Can you feel the groove 
 
We let it rock to free your energy 
You let it roll, come on get on your feet 
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams 
You let it roll, up to the ecstasy

WE'LL BURN THE SKY

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Monika Dannemann 
 
I'm in love with the sunshine 
I'm in love with the falling rain 
everything seems to call your name 
yesterday you were leaving 
 leaving life and all the pain 
 everything wants you back again. 
 
I've found myself through you 
and there was love in my life 
 I felt always naturally high and my love had a home 
but now my mind has started to roam 
you're my life giving fire and you carried all my love 
through you I was so inspired 
you're engraved deep in my heart 
 
My dreams recall us being one 
I've searched for you to be free 
my force of life you have always been 
 I Feel blue since you've gone 
 your breath of love surrounded me 
 when can I rejoin you to be free 
 
Wait, can this be a dream 
there is a voice in my head 
 it belongs to you, it say's 
don't cry, no need to be sad 
 there's a way to stay with you again 
it's more than you ever had 
and no death brings us apart 
our timeless love always grows 
 because you are in my other heart 
 
I know we've never been apart 
 your love sets fire to my heart 
 we'll burn the sky 
when it's time for me to die 
we'll burn the sky...

WHAT U GIVE U GET BACK

 Music: Rudolf Schenker, Peter Wolf 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker 
 
What you give, you get back 
As long as I can think I've been 
Running to be free 
There's not a place that could have been too far 
Had nothing but a bag of dreams 
And this old guitar 
A couple of songs to play for you an me 
There's so much love inside of me 
That wants to be released 
I can't help it so I give it all away 
What you give you get it back 
So take my love just because it's all I have 
Take my heart take my soul 
I just never want it back 
As long as I've been living 
I've had music in my veins 
I can't go on without it anymore 
My suitcase is a wanderer 
That takes me I believe 
For a walk right across your heart 
There's so much love inside of you 
That wants to be released 
And all you gotta do is let it go 
What you give you get back 
So take my love just because it's all I have 
Take my heart take my soul 
I just never want it back 
Cause the love you give, is the love you'll get 
There's so much love inside of me 
That wants to be released 
I can't help it so I gave it all away 
What you give you get back 
So take my love just because it's all I have 
What you give you get back 
So take my love just because it's all I have 
Take my heart take my soul 
I just never want it back 
Cause your love, your love is all I have 
All I have 
Love is all we have 
All I have

WHEN LOVE KILLS LOVE

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker 
 
When love kills love 
 
Suddenly I think I always knew 
I had my share of mistakes 
Made quite a few 
Finally I know and that's for sure 
I don't look back in anger anymore 
 
Suddenly the sun comes up again 
There's a new beginning 
When we pass the end 
Finally I know and that's for sure 
I don't look back in anger anymore 
 
When love kills love 
Will someone rescue me 
When love kills love 
It's cutting through so deep 
 
Suddenly I wake up from the dream 
Someone tells me 
I've been talking in the sleep 
Finally I know and that's for sure 
I don't believe in daydreams anymore 
 
When love kills love 
Will someone rescue me 
When love kills love 
It's cutting through so deep 
Well life goes 'round 
And upside down 
It's pretty mad 
 
When love kills love 
Will someone set me free 
When love kills love 
It's cutting through so deep 
How can we choose 
When all we lose 
Is all we have 
 
We run away 
From all the pain 
We run away 
From all the pain 
 
When love kills love 
Will someone rescue me 
When love kills love 
It's cutting through so deep 
 
When love kills love 
When love kills love 
When love kills love 
When love kills love

WHEN THE SMOKE IS GOING DOWN

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Just when you make your way back home 
I find some time to be alone 
I go to see the place once more 
Just like a thousand nights before 
I climb the stage again this night 
'Cause the place seems still alive 
When the smoke is going down 
 
This is the place where I belong 
I really love to turn you on 
I've got your sound still in my ear 
While your traces disappear 
I climb the stage again this night 
'Cause the place seems still alive 
When the smoke is going down 
 
I climb the stage again this night 
'Cause the place seems still alive 
When the smoke is going down 
When the smoke is going down 
When the smoke is going down

WHEN YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE

 Music: Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker, Titiek Puspa, James F. Sundah 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker, Titiek Puspa, James F. Sundah 
 
You give me your smile 
A piece of your heart 
You give me the feel I've been looking for 
You give me your soul 
Your innocent love 
You are the one I've been waiting for 
I've been waiting for 
 
We're lost in a kiss 
A moment in time 
Forever young 
Just forever, just forever in love 
 
When you came into my life 
It took my breath away 
Cause your love has found it's way 
To my heart 
 
Ooh, ahh 
Ooh, ahh 
 
You make me dream 
By the look in your eyes 
You give me the feel, I've been longing for 
I wanna give you my soul 
All my life 
Cause you are the one I've been waiting for 
I've been waiting for so long 
 
When you came into my life 
It took my breath away 
And the world stopped turnin' round 
For your love 
When you came into my life 
It took my breath away 
Cause your love has found it's way 
To my heart 
Into my heart 
 
Just forever in love 
 
When you came into my life 
It took my breath away 
And the world stopped turnin' round 
For your love 
When you came into my life 
It took my breath away 
Cause your love has found it's way 
To my heart 
When you came into my life 
 
When you came into my life 
It took my breath away 
And the world stopped turnin' round 
For your love 
When you came into my life 
It took my breath away 
Cause your love has found it's way 
To my heart

WHERE THE RIVER FLOWS

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Under suburban skies 
Where life is bleeding 
Where concrete skies are grey 
There's plenty of room for dreaming 
 
I still keep coming here 
Follow those traces 
I travel back in time 
Remember all those places 
Feels like I never left 
The house's still standing 
Down by the river where 
The dreams are never ending 
 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me by the river 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me where the river flows 
 
Under the silent moon 
This industrial city 
Is heartland even though 
Life's been not that pretty 
I still keep coming here 
To that old river 
To find my roots just where 
The future lives forever 
 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me by the river 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me, you can find me 
 
By the river where dreams will never die 
By the river under suburban skies 
 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me by the river 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me where the river flows 
 
By the river where dreams have never died 
By the river I look through children's eyes 
 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me by the river 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me where the river flows 
 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me by the river 
You find me 
You find me 
You find me where the river flows 
 
Where the river flows 
Where the river flows 
Where the river flows

WHITE DOVE

 Music: Presser, Adamis, Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
A place without a name 
Under a burning sky 
There's no milk and honey here 
In the land of God 
Someone holds a sign 
It says we are human, too 
And while the sun goes down 
The world goes by 
 
White dove 
Fly with the wind 
Take our hope under your wings 
For the world to know 
That hope will not die 
Where the children cry 
 
Waves, big like a house 
They're stranded on a piece of wood 
To leave it all behind 
To start again 
But instead of a new life 
All they find is a door that's closed 
And they keep looking for 
A place called home 
 
White dove 
Fly with the wind 
Take our hope under your wings 
For the world to know 
That hope will not die 
Where the children cry 
 
Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
 
Can anyone tell me why (can anyone tell me why) 
The children of the world (children of the world) 
Have to pay the price (pay the price) 
 
And now you're telling me 
You've seen it all before 
I know that's right but still 
It breaks my heart 
Well, the golden lamb we've sent 
Makes us feel better now 
But you know it's just a drop 
In a sea of tears 
 
White dove 
Fly with the wind 
Take our hope under your wings 
For the world to know 
That hope will not die 
Where the children cry 
 
White dove 
Fly with the wind 
Take our hope under your wings 
For the world to know 
That hope will not die 
Where the children cry 
 
Na na na na na na

Don't hear the phone that rings 
I know the fever's coming 
God knows what life will bring 
This Sunday morning (Sunday Morning) without a warning 
 
Don't hear the neighbour scream 
He thinks my house is burning 
Well, life is good to me 
This Sunday morning (yeah) 
 
She's a wild child 
And her l l love turns a man insane 
She's a wild child 
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain 
 
Don't hear the backdoor crack 
Don't see the cops are coming back 
It's burnin' in my bed 
This Sunday morning (yeah) 
 
She's a wild child (she's a wild child) 
And her l l love turns a man insane 
She's a wild child (she's a wild child) 
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain 
 
She's on fire 
She's on fire 
She's on fire 
 
She's a wild child 
And her l l love turns a man insane 
She's a wild child 
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain 
 
She's a wild child (she's a wild child) 
And her l l love turns a man insane 
She's a wild child (she's a wild child) 
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain

WIND OF CHANGE

 Music: Klaus Meine 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I follow the Moskva 
Down to Gorky Park 
Listening to the wind of change 
An August summer night 
Soldiers passing by 
Listening to the wind of change 
 
The world is closing in 
Did you ever think 
That we could be so close, like brothers 
The future's in the air 
I can feel it everywhere 
Blowing with the wind of change 
 
Take me to the magic of the moment 
On a glory night 
Where the children of tomorrow dream away 
In the wind of change 
 
Walking down the street 
Distant memories 
Are buried in the past forever 
I follow the Moskva 
Down to Gorky Park 
Listening to the wind of change 
 
Take me to the magic of the moment 
On a glory night 
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams 
With you and me 
Take me to the magic of the moment 
On a glory night 
Where the children of tomorrow dream away 
in the wind of change 
 
The wind of change 
Blows straight into the face of time 
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell 
For peace of mind 
Let your balalaika sing 
What my guitar wants to say 
 
Take me to the magic of the moment 
On a glory night 
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams 
With you and me 
Take me to the magic of the moment

WOMAN

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
Woman you can change my world 
Woman you can change my world 
 
I'm chained to the fears 
Inside these walls 
The silence talks loud 
'bout the things I recall 
Through the bricks in the window 
I scream at the world 
But when no one is listening 
It's hard to be heard 
 
Woman you can change my world 
Woman there'll be no return 
 
I see shadows 
Coming through the walls 
I hear voices 
But no one's talking at all 
I can feel the madness 
Crawling up my spine 
Reachin' out 
To grab your mind 
 
Woman come and change my world 
 
(Do you remember all those fears?) 
They won't leave me alone 
(Do you remember all those tears?) 
I pretend to be strong 
(Do you remember all the pain?) 
I'm getting tired of the game 
I cannot live I cannot die 
I wanna know who the hell am I 
 
You've never seen me 
But I know you so well 
And before it kills me 
I gotta break the spell 
The deeper we touch 
The higher we'll go 
The time has come 
To heal my soul 
 
Woman you can change my world 
 
(Do you remember all those fears?) 
They won't leave me alone 
(Do you remember all those tears?) 
I pretend to be strong 
(Do you remember all the pain?) 
I'm getting tired of the game 
I cannot live I cannot die 
I wanna know who the hell am I 
 
Woman I'm gonna change your world

YELLOW BUTTERFLY

 Music: Rudolf Schenker, Marti Frederiksen 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
In the temple of gods 
The day had come to come together 
In the early morning sun 
They saw that girl that come to heaven 
 
They ask her 'bout life on earth 
If it was getting any better 
She told 'em someone took her life 
If they could send her back 
Just one more time 
She knew that someone feels so blue 
 
Wouldn't it be nice ...Hold on 
To spread the wings and fly ...Don't kill the butterfly 
To see him one more time ...Hold on 
To be a yellow butterfly ...Don't kill the butterfly 
 
He's been sitting on the bay 
Lost inside a cloud of darkness 
When I saw the butterfly 
Dancing in the wind 
The story goes 
He knew that she was still so close 
 
Wouldn't it be nice ...Hold on 
To spread the wings and fly ...Don't kill the butterfly 
To see him one more time ...Hold on 
To be a yellow butterfly ...Don't kill the butterfly

YELLOW RAVEN

 Music: Ulrich Roth 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
The yellow raven sipped the air 
Of thunder and of rain ... 
The yellow raven sipped the air 
Gentle eyes kissing the rain ... 
 
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird? 
Take me away to somewhere 
Take me away from here! 
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird? 
Answer to my yearning 
Take me away from here! 
 
The firebird began to cry 
When the music died away ... 
The firebird began to cry 
And smoke was slowly drifting by ... 
 
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird? 
Take me away to somewhere 
Take me away from here! 
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird? 
Answer to my yearning 
Take me away from here ...

YOU & I

 Music: Klaus Meine 
Lyrics: Klaus Meine 
 
I lose control because of you babe 
I lose control when you look at me like this 
There's something in your eyes that is saying tonight 
I'm not a child anymore, life has opened the door 
To a new exciting life 
 
I lose control when I'm close to you babe 
I lose control don't look at me like this 
There's something in your eyes, is this love at first sight 
Like a flower that grows, life just wants you to know 
All the secrets of life 
 
It's all written down in your lifelines 
It's written down inside your heart 
 
You and I just have a dream 
To find our love a place, where we can hide away 
You and I were just made 
To love each other now, forever and a day 
 
I lose control because of you babe 
I lose control don't look at me like this 
There's something in your eyes that is saying tonight 
I'm so curious for more just like never before 
In my innocent life 
 
It's all written down in your lifelines 
It's written down inside your heart 
 
You and I just have a dream 
To find our love a place, where we can hide away 
You and I were just made 
To love each other now, forever and a day 
 
Time stands still when the days of innocence 
Are falling for the night 
I love you girl I always will 
I swear I'm there for you 
Till the day I die 
 
You and I just have a dream 
To find our love a place, where we can hide away 
You and I were just made 
To love each other now, forever and a day 
 
...

YOU GIVE ME ALL I NEED

 Music: Rudolf Schenker 
Lyrics: Herman Rarebell 
 
New love is blind 
Why don't you see 
You hurt me inside, you're killing me 
It makes me sad all the time 
To see you around with all these guys 
My heart's in pain 
I need you so 
My love's the same 
So please don't go 
 
You give me all I need 
You give me all I need 
You give me all I need 
You give me all I need 
 
Let's try again 
There's still romance 
We'll start a new life, take a chance 
There are so many ways 
Please don't forget it anyday 
My heart's in pain 
I need you so 
My love's the same 
So please don't go 
 
You give me all I need 
You give me all I need 
You give me all I need 
You give me all I need

YOUR LIGHT

 Music: Ulrich Roth 
Lyrics: Ulrich Roth 
 
When you're feeling lost and blue 
when there is no love for you 
you'll find him and it's allright, allright. 
 
When you're feeling down and low 
when you've got no place to go 
and when none smiles hello 
he's by your side, you know 
 
When you're getting deaf and blind 
when you draw one leg behind 
and when you finally gonna lose your mind 
it's allright, allright 
 
'cos he is by your side 
'cos he will be your guide 
'cos he will be your light 
and you're not alone.
