
A vagabond is a newcomer 
in a heap of trouble.
He’s an eyeball at a peephole 
that should be electrocuted. 
He’s a leper in a textile mill
and likely to be beheaded, I mean,
given a liverwurst sandwich 
on the break by the brook 
where the loaves are sliced. 
But he oughtn’t meddle
with the powder puffs on the golf links
they have their own goats to tame, 
dirigibles to situate.
He can act like an imbecile 
if the climate is propitious, 
a magnate of kidnap
paradising around the oily depot, 
or a speck from a distant nebula
wishing to purchase a certain skyscraper ....

Well, if it’s permitted, then 
let’s regulate him, let’s testify
against his thimble, and moderate his gloves 
before they sew an apron.

The local minister is thinking
of moving to Holland, exchanging
his old ballads for some lingerie.
“Zatso!” says the vagabond.
Homeless, like wheat that tattletales 
on the sermon, like wages swigged.
“Zatso, zatso, zatso!” cries the vagabond. 
The minister reels under the weight
of his thumbs, the vagabond seems to have
jutted into his kernel, disturbed
his terminal core. Slowly, and with 
trifling dignity, the minister removes 
from his lapel his last campaign button: 
Don’t Mess with Raymond, New Hampshire.
