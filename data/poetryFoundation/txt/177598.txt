The ship at anchor wasn’t what it seemed— 
yet Punchinello gripped the eagle’s neck. 
(The dream of life is just another dream.) 

It soared above the masts, canals, the steam 
of chimneys, till our Punch was just a speck. 
The ship at anchor wasn’t what it seemed, 

the harbor, Venice, Europe—even the gleam 
blazing San Marco’s horses shrank. A fleck! 
The dream of life is just another dream 

that really wants a king, a god’s regime, 
or some poor hurricane to wreck 
the ship at anchor. Wasn’t what it seemed, 

Punch’s old life, another Ponzi scheme? 
Weren’t sailors waving from the quarter-deck? 
The dream of life is just another dream 

that none of us will live to see redeemed. 
Death scrawls his bold John Hancock on your check. 
The ship at anchor wasn’t what it seemed. 
The dream of life is just another dream.
