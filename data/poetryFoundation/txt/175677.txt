The householder issuing to the street 
Is adrift a moment in that ice stiff   
Exterior. ‘Peninsula 
Low lying in the bay 
And wooded—’ Native now 
Are the welder and the welder’s arc 
In the subway’s iron circuits: 
We have not escaped each other, 
Not in the forest, not here. The crippled girl hobbles   
Painfully in the new depths   
Of the subway, and painfully   
We shift our eyes. The bare rails   
And black walls contain 
Labor before her birth, her twisted 
Precarious birth and the men   
Laborious, burly—She sits   
Quiet, her eyes still. Slowly,   
Deliberately she sees 
An anchor’s blunt fluke sink   
Thru coins and coin machines,   
The ancient iron and the voltage 
In the iron beneath us in the child’s deep 
Harbors into harbor sand.
