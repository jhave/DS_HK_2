Morning arrives 
unannounced 
by limousine: the tall   
emaciated chairman 

of sleeplessness in person 
steps out on the sidewalk 
and donning black glasses, ascends   
the stairs to your building 

guided by a German shepherd.   
After a couple faint knocks   
at the door, he slowly opens   
the book of blank pages 

pointing out 
with a pale manicured finger   
particular clauses, 
proof of your guilt.
