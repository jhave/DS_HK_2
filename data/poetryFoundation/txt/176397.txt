Night after night forever the dolls lay stiff 
by the children’s dreams. On the goose-feathers of the rich,   
on the straw of the poor, on the gypsy ground— 
wherever the children slept, dolls have been found   
in the subsoil of the small loves stirred again   
by the Finders After Everything. Down lay 
the children by their hanks and twists. Night after night   
grew over imagination. The fuzzies shed, the bright   
buttons fell out of the heads, arms ripped, and down   
through goose-feathers, straw; and the gypsy ground   
the dolls sank, and some—the fuzziest and most loved 
changed back to string and dust, and the dust moved   
dream-puffs round the Finders’ boots as they dug,   
sieved, brushed, and came on a little clay dog, 
and a little stone man, and a little bone girl, that had kept   
their eyes wide open forever, while all the children slept.
