In my heart the old love   
   Struggled with the new,   
It was ghostly waking   
   All night through.    

Dear things, kind things   
   That my old love said,   
Ranged themselves reproachfully   
   Round my bed.    

But I could not heed them,   
   For I seemed to see   
Dark eyes of my new love   
   Fixed on me.    

Old love, old love,   
   How can I be true?   
Shall I be faithless to myself   
   Or to you?

I 

Oh chimes set high on the sunny tower   
    Ring on, ring on unendingly, 
Make all the hours a single hour,   
For when the dusk begins to flower,   
    The man I love will come to me! ... 

But no, go slowly as you will, 
    I should not bid you hasten so,   
For while I wait for love to come,   
Some other girl is standing dumb, 
    Fearing her love will go. 


       II 

Oh white steam over the roofs, blow high!   
    Oh chimes in the tower ring clear and free!   
Oh sun awake in the covered sky, 
    For the man I love, loves me! ... 

Oh drifting steam disperse and die, 
    Oh tower stand shrouded toward the south,-- 
Fate heard afar my happy cry, 
    And laid her finger on my mouth. 


       III 

The dusk was blue with blowing mist,   
    The lights were spangles in a veil,   
And from the clamor far below 
    Floated faint music like a wail. 

It voiced what I shall never speak, 
    My heart was breaking all night long, 
But when the dawn was hard and gray,   
    My tears distilled into a song. 


       IV 

I said, “I have shut my heart   
    As one shuts an open door, 
That Love may starve therein   
    And trouble me no more.” 

But over the roofs there came 
    The wet new wind of May, 
And a tune blew up from the curb 
    Where the street-pianos play. 

My room was white with the sun   
    And Love cried out to me, 
“I am strong, I will break your heart   
    Unless you set me free.”

Lyric night of the lingering Indian Summer,
Shadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing, 
Never a bird, but the passionless chant of insects, 
       Ceaseless, insistent.   

The grasshopper's horn, and far-off, high in the maples, 
The wheel of a locust leisurely grinding the silence 
Under a moon waning and worn, broken, 
       Tired with summer.    

Let me remember you, voices of little insects,
Weeds in the moonlight, fields that are tangled with asters, 
Let me remember, soon will the winter be on us,
       Snow-hushed and heavy.   

Over my soul murmur your mute benediction,
While I gaze, O fields that rest after harvest,
As those who part look long in the eyes they lean to, 
       Lest they forget them.

Agathas 

Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days,
All of whom she refused;

And now she turns to me seeking love,
And her hair also is turning.

Young Lady 

I have fed your lar with poppies,
I have adored you for three full years;
And now you grumble because your dress does not fit
And because I happen to say so.

Lesbia Illa 

Memnon, Memnon, that lady
Who used to walk about amongst us
With such gracious uncertainty,
Is now wedded
To a British householder.
Lugete, Veneres! Lugete, Cupidinesque! 

Passing 

Flawless as Aphrodite,
Thoroughly beautiful,
Brainless,
The faint odor of your patchouli,
Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin,
Assails me, and concerns me almost as little.

I. 
There's a little square in Paris, 
Waiting until we pass. 
They sit idly there, 
They sip the glass. 

There's a cab-horse at the corner, 
There's rain. The season grieves. 
It was silver once, 
And green with leaves. 

There's a parrot in a window, 
Will see us on parade, 
Hear the loud drums roll-- 
And serenade. 


                           II. 
This was the salty taste of glory, 
That it was not 
Like Agamemnon's story. 
Only, an eyeball in the mud, 
And Hopkins, 
Flat and pale and gory! 


                           III. 
But the bugles, in the night, 
Were wings that bore 
To where our comfort was; 

Arabesques of candle beams, 
Winding 
Through our heavy dreams; 

Winds that blew 
Where the bending iris grew; 

Birds of intermitted bliss, 
Singing in the night's abyss; 

Vines with yellow fruit, 
That fell 
Along the walls 
That bordered Hell. 


                           IV. 
Death's nobility again 
Beautified the simplest men. 
Fallen Winkle felt the pride 
Of Agamemnon 
When he died. 

What could London's 
Work and waste 
Give him-- 
To that salty, sacrificial taste? 

What could London's 
Sorrow bring-- 
To that short, triumphant sting?
